      <p>
        <span
          >There was an injury where a Greyhound bus collided with a
          tractor-trailer. One of the bus passengers was hurt and sued
          Greyhound, the bus driver, and the owner of the tractor-trailer. The
          <span class="GramE">bus company</span> and trailer company have
          cross-claims. The carrier company put in a request for a series of
          examinations of the bus driver. The trial court allowed all of the
          medical exams! Is this an appropriate use of Rule 35? We know that we
          can obtain these sorts of exams when the condition of a party is in
          controversy. There is no question that the driver is a party to the
          lawsuit. The driver is a defendant to the original lawsuit. Does it
          make a difference that the discovery request is coming from another
          defendant on a cross-claim? Is the physical condition of the party in
          controversy? Usually when we think of this, we think of the condition
          of the plaintiff who got hurt. Did the driver put his condition at
          issue? The driver admitted in a deposition that he saw the truck�s
          brake lights go on, but he hit it anyway.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The Supreme Court eventually vacates the ruling. If anything is at
          issue, it�s sight. There isn�t any justification for other kinds of
          exams. Why doesn�t the court allow an ophthalmologic exam? They
          granted an order vacating all the exams, and an eye exam
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">may</i> be possible, but the
          evidentiary link must be established in order for this exam to be
          ordered.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This case isn�t exactly a landmark case: it doesn�t establish a new
          rule particularly, but it shows that Rule 35 is broader than just a
          plaintiff�s rule. Also, it shows that Rule 35 is not a carte blanche
          to provide any conceivable kind of exam.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >This is a much more broadly focused case and it establishes some
          larger issues. There were some tug boat guys who got killed. Norman
          Hickman is one of the guys killed. There�s this attorney,
          <span class="SpellE">Fortenbaugh</span>, who is employed by the tug
          boat company. This lawyer interviews witnesses to prepare for trial.
          He talks to the survivors and other witnesses. He made notes about
          what they said. There is an interrogatory from Hickman to provide the
          notes from these interviews. The attorney declines, claiming that the
          memos are privileged. But he ends up going to jail for contempt!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Are these documents really privileged? We�re told that these memos
          fall outside of attorney-client privilege. If it�s not privileged, is
          it relevant? Yes. These are the statements of people who would know
          best what happened. If it�s not privileged and it�s relevant, you
          usually get it. But at the end of the day, they
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">don�t</i> get this. Why not?
          The Court says that it�s not protected from discovery. But what makes
          this material special and allows it to be treated specially? It�s
          attorney work product. The information would otherwise be
          discoverable.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are two types of information: first, witness statements in some
          form. Why aren�t these discoverable? As to these witnesses, the Court
          tells us that there may be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">some</i> way to get this
          information, but not on these facts. There was no effort on the part
          of the requestors to get this information themselves. They could have
          just gone out and done these interviews themselves. They must show
          some reason why the other attorney�s work should be available to them.
          What about the mental impressions of the lawyer as a result of the
          other witness investigation? The Court says there is no legitimate
          purpose served by having this information discoverable.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Rule 26(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>3) talks about trial
          preparation and what may or may not be discoverable. A party may
          obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise
          discoverable prepared in the preparation of litigation
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">only</i> upon a showing of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">substantial need</i>. If the
          material is otherwise discoverable and doesn�t relate to experts, and
          was prepared in anticipation of litigation, then you can�t get
          discovery of that information
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">unless</i> the discoverer can
          show some substantial need and there is no reasonably available
          substitute. Even then, the court will protect the lawyer�s mental
          impressions in constructing an order of discovery. Who does this Rule
          apply to? It applies not just to the party�s attorney, but also the
          party�s consultant or other representative. If you find great
          eyewitnesses, you must give up the name of who you found, but you
          don�t have to give up exactly what they said. Just because you spent a
          lot of money finding a witness, you still have to cough up their
          name.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >If someone isn�t a party to a lawsuit, they can obtain a statement
          that they made previously. A party might not be able to get this
          statement, but a non-party can get it for you.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Who is the client in the corporate context? The �Control Group Test�
          protects communications by decision-makers or those who influence
          them. Rehnquist says we want to encourage frank communication between
          attorneys and clients. We don�t want to just protect the top of the
          hierarchy. The Court doesn�t establish a set rule, but it did stop the
          use of the �Control Test�. An alternative test is the �Subject Matter
          Test�, which provides any employee with privilege as long as the
          matter is within the employee�s performance of their duties.</span

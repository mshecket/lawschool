          >There are fewer and fewer actual trials, even though there are many,
          many more cases! The data that Fairman is showing us is just for
          federal trials. Most cases are state cases, though. And when we look
          at what happens in the states, the data is about the same. Lots of
          cases settle, around 70% of them. Rule 12 motions dispose of a certain
          number of cases. Default judgments can cause the end of suits. Summary
          judgment, dismissals, and ADR are other options.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Here are Paula and Darlene. Paula sues Darlene for negligence. Twenty
          days pass, but nothing happens. Can you ask for default judgment? One
          option is if you are asking for a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">sum certain</i> amount. On the
          other hand, if it�s not a sum certain, you must go before the court.
          You�ll have to prove the damages before the judge so that the judge
          can enter judgment for an amount. This isn�t particularly cumbersome
          because there�s nobody on the other side. So in this example, it�s a
          car wreck so we don�t have a sum certain. You�ll have to go to the
          judge. What could Darlene do about this? Rule 54(c) says you can set
          aside a default judgment for good cause. This Rule uses Rule 60 as a
          standard for when a court will set aside a previous ruling.</span

        <span>This is a Supreme Court case generated by the state of </span

          ><st1:place><span>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. What happened? Peralta had an employee who got injured, went to the
          hospital, and was supposed to pay for the employee�s injuries. Peralta
          was served, but under </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          law, he claimed invalid service. Peralta chooses not to show up. Don�t
          take a default judgment when you have property in the jurisdiction of
          the court! His stuff gets sold! He goes to court in an attempt to
          argue for a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">bill of review</i>.
          You need three things: (1) a meritorious defense, (2) being prevented
          from raising the defense by the wrongful act of another party, and (3)
          the defaulting party had no fault. The courts reject the bill of
          review because there is no meritorious defense. That leads to the
          federal review that gets to the Supreme Court.</span

        <span
          >Justice White says that to have due process, you need notice that is
          reasonably designed to tell parties what�s up. But if Peralta has no
          meritorious defense, why isn�t that just the end? The difficult thing
          is the question of whether there was notice. Peralta had every
          opportunity to respond to the suit outside of court. But he chose not
          to. This is a hard-line notice view! The reality is that Peralta had
          actual notice. But the Court doesn�t care! What can the hospital do
          now? Can they still get Peralta?</span

          >If your suit gets involuntarily dismissed under Rule 41, you win.
          They can�t file the lawsuit again. It�s a determination on the merits.
          Voluntary dismissal, on the other hand, is governed by Rule 41(a), and
          it provides for voluntary dismissals either by answer or
          agreement.</span

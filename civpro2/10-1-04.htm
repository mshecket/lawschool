<br/>

<p><span>So
far, we’ve seen the rudimentary structure of the way Rule 23 works and how it’s
applied in the federal courts. The Rule
has two parts: 23(a), which establishes the four prerequisites, and 23(b),
which classifies the classes into one of three rigid categories.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Hansberry v.
Lee</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Hansberrys bought a house in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Chicago</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> allegedly covered by a
racially restrictive covenant. The Lee
family is trying to stop them from moving in. So in the trial court, Lee sues the Hansberrys and the sellers of the property. The Hansberrys discovered that the
restrictive covenant is no good because it was not signed by 95% of the
residents. So Hansberry says you can’t
enforce it anyway, and no deed restriction has been broken because none
exists. Lee responds that the issue has
been precluded because the covenant has already been upheld. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Burke
v. Kleiman</i>, the parties falsely stipulated that 95% of the residents <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>had</i> signed the covenant.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
didn’t have the class action rule that we have today back in 1940. Burke purported to represent herself and
other property owners in similar situations. So it was a plaintiffs’ class against an individual defendant. The Illinois Supreme Court decided that it
was indeed a class action and that Hansberry is a member of that class, and
thus is bound by the stipulation that 95% of the signatures had been achieved. But was Hansberry really represented by the plaintiff
class in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Burke</i>? No! There was a problem! Burke’s
class representatives were trying to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>uphold</i>
the restrictive covenant! They didn’t
represent Hansberry’s interests! They
were adverse to his interests! Justice
Stone says that Hansberry is not part of the same class as the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Burke</i> class.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case stands for three things: (1) class members are entitled to adequate
representation <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as a matter of constitutional
law</i> as a prerequisite to being bound by class litigation. (2) Since Hansberry isn’t going to be bound
by the ruling in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Burke v. Kleiman</i>, he
can dispute the factual finding that 95% of the residents signed the
covenant. If you’re not an active
participant in the class litigation, you can collaterally attack that litigation
to see if you’re really bound by the former class because you were adequately
represented by it. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) If you <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are</i> adequately represented, class
members are bound by the result of the class litigation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>To
what decree are the differences in the classes and the different requirements
that the Rules embody creatures of efficiency as opposed to dictated by what
the Constitution requires, especially along the lines of notice?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Phillips
Petroleum v. Shutts</span></i></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
we have Phillips Petroleum. Phillips
spews forth oil. The leaseholds are
owned by individuals such as Shutts. Phillips is trying to screw the little guys by paying them royalties on prices
that are too low. Shutts wants to
recover interest on the money that was withheld. There are 33,000 people in Shutts’s position
who get together to sue for the interest the oil company owes. Shutts sues in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Kansas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. None of these people have much interest. Each of them has a small amount of interest
in their interest. This is a perfect
example of class litigation bringing together small claims that are too small
to litigate individually. Shutts
provides the best possible notice. He
sends out a letter to all of the class members telling them they can opt-out if
they want. 28,100 are in, 3,400 opt out,
and 1,500 were not found and excluded. Less
than 1,000 of the plaintiffs are actually in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Kansas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and a negligible part of
the oil and gas leases are in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Kansas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Phillips makes a personal jurisdiction
argument that only the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Kansas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> plaintiffs can sue. Phillips argues that there has to be an
opt-in procedure.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Justice
Rehnquist says we don’t need opt-in. Why? The issues of personal
jurisdiction are not the same when you talk about a class of out-of-state <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>plaintiffs</i> than when you talk about out-of-state
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>defendants</i>. When you’re a class-action plaintiff, the
state <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i> exercise jurisdiction over
the claim of an absent class-plaintiff, even though that plaintiff may not have
minimum contacts. But the minimal
requirements of due process must be met: there must be notice plus the
opportunity to be heard and the ability to opt out. This later gets built in to Rule 23.</span></p>

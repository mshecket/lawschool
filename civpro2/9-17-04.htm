<p><span>You
must read the supplemental jurisdiction statute very carefully. Who makes the claim and who is brought in
makes a difference as to whether the court has jurisdiction. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>This
will very likely be on the exam.</i></span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Compulsory joinder – Rule 19</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
has also been described as joinder of “necessary and indispensable parties”. Rule 20, permissive joinder, allows you to
bring in essentially everybody. Rule 19
is talking about when people <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>have to</i>
be brought in, and if they can’t be brought in, what the court should do. Rule 19(a) determines whether they’re a party
that is necessary for complete adjudication. If complete relief can’t be given to the people who are already parties without
another person, or the person could be subjected to multiple or inconsistent
obligations in their absence, then they had better be brought in. If their relationship to the lawsuit is so
important that the people in the lawsuit can’t get relief or they would be hurt
if they’re not brought in, then they’re necessary parties.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
Rule 19(b), the court has to decide whether the action should proceed or be
dismissed. Do we have to dismiss the
lawsuit when we lack a person? There are
certain factors the court considers: (1) the extent to which a judgment will be
prejudicial to parties already involved in the lawsuit, (2) whether the judgment
will be adequate without that person’s interest being represented, and (3)
whether the person will still have a good remedy if you dismiss them for non-joinder.</span></p>

class=GramE>Temple v. <span class=SpellE>Synthes</span> Corp.</span></a></span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case is trying to tell us that the Rule has two parts in a sequence. If you don’t fit in part (a), you never get
to part (b). The plaintiff has spine
surgery. There is a plate and screw
device implanted that broke. The guy
with the hurt back is a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> resident and the hospital
is in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. <span
class=SpellE>Synthes</span> is a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> company. Who do we sue? The plaintiff sues the manufacturer in federal
court, and sues the doctor and hospital in state court. The plaintiff chose to have two different
lawsuits going on about the same subject matter in different forums!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
no problem with personal jurisdiction for filing both suits in state court in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. There’s a Rule 12(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>7)
motion to dismiss! This tells you
something about Rule 19. It’s a joinder
of parties rule, but it’s used by defendants to get lawsuits dismissed. The defendant says that the lawsuit must be
dismissed because there aren’t enough defendants to sue! The motion to dismiss is based on non-joinder
of the hospital and doctor, who arguably must be joined. Could </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Temple</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> have brought everyone into
one lawsuit? Sure! It’s the same transaction or occurrence. There’s personal jurisdiction in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> because the state and federal
court cases are filed there. Subject
matter jurisdiction would be diversity: </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> versus </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. This lawsuit could go forward.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
if <span class=SpellE>Synthes</span> wanted the doctor and hospital in the suit
so bad, why didn’t they just implead them under Rule 14(a)? <span class=GramE>Because impleader must be
based on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>derivative</i> liability.</span> If there was a contract between <span
class=SpellE>Synthes</span> and the doctor and hospital, then there might be a
chance to implead them, but there’s no basis for derivative liability on the
facts that we know them. So why does <span
class=SpellE>Synthes</span> want them involved in the lawsuit? If the plaintiff loses the federal suit, he
doesn’t necessarily lose the state suit. We have to think about strategy here. What’s the risk that the defendants are facing when they’re
separated? They could <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> get hit because it’s two different causes
of action! Typically, as a plaintiff,
you would want both defendants in the same lawsuit because they’ll make your
case for you. Factually, it turns out
that <span class=SpellE>Synthes</span> had such a close relationship with the
doctor and hospital that they thought it was unlikely they would point the
finger at each other.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
does the Supreme Court deal with this issue? Are the hospital and doctor, as the manufacturer claims, parties that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>have</i> to be joined? It’s not even a close case! The district court went immediately to Rule
19(b) to look at the prejudice factors, but they failed to make a determination
under Rule 19(a) that they were necessary to begin with. By avoiding the threshold question, they
circumvented the Rule, according to the Supreme Court. You need to find a “home” for yourself in
Rule 19(a) before you get to the balancing test in Rule 19(b). The Fifth Circuit was so careful in its
analysis that it didn’t even read the notes to the Rule! Joint tortfeasors are not necessary and
indispensable parties! There aren’t that
many parties that are truly indispensable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
say for example, a husband and wife own land a buyer wants to buy it. He enters into a contract with the husband
only. There is a breach, and the buyer
wants specific performance. Is the wife
going to be a Rule 19 party? Is the wife
a necessary and indispensable person? There’s no way on these facts that the buyer can get specific
performance of the land contract if it’s jointly owned by the husband and
wife. Without the wife being there, the court
can’t adjudicate the wife’s half-interest in the land. This is something brought up by the defendant
trying to get out of the lawsuit rather than the plaintiff trying to join other
parties. Other examples would include
people with joint interests in property, joint obligors/obligees, represented
parties and limited pools/multiple claimant.</span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><b><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> Diamond Shops v. Valley West Des Moines Shopping Center</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Helzberg’s</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> made a lease with the shopping center that provided that only three full-line
jewelry stores can be in the shopping center. Lord’s gets a lease as a specialty jewelry store, but then it turns out
that they intend to be full-line in breach of the lease with <span
class=SpellE>Helzberg’s</span>. What
does <span class=SpellE>Helzberg’s</span> do? They go for an injunction in federal court to keep the shopping center
from breaching the lease. The basis for subject
matter jurisdiction is diversity. The
shopping center moves to dismiss because they think under Rule 19 Lord’s is an
indispensable party. The motion is
denied. It does seem like this case has
a lot to do with Lord’s. This was an
appeal of the grant of an injunction. We
don’t know what the result will be on the merits. The Court of Appeals is taking up an appeal
under a special interlocutory appeal statute. So is Lord’s a Rule 19(a) party? Do they clear the first part of the Rule? Sure. They’re a Rule 19(a) party…more specifically, Rule 19(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>2)(<span class=SpellE>i</span>). But they are considered necessary, but <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> indispensable. It’s not necessary to dismiss the lawsuit
under Rule 19(b).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
contract between <span class=SpellE>Helzberg’s</span> and the shopping center
cannot adjudicate all of Lord’s rights. If the injunction holds, Lord’s will have to file <span class=GramE>their
own</span> suit against the shopping center. Is the shopping center hurt? The
opinion says that it’s their fault for getting into two contracts that appear
to be inconsistent. They basically say: “tough
luck”. With the <span class=SpellE>Helzberg’s</span>
judgment in hand, Lord’s would sue the shopping center for breach.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Are
there other things the court could do? They could have dismissed the lawsuit. Is there a place where this whole lawsuit could go on? It could maybe go on in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Iowa</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The mall is physically located here. There is a transfer of venue statute that
allows them to pack up the case and move it to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Iowa</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> district court instead of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
change the situation, and make Lord’s from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The shopping center wanted to exercise supplemental
jurisdiction over this claim against Lord’s. Could they do so? § 1367(a) tells
us that there is supplemental jurisdiction over the same case or controversy,
but the case is basely solely on diversity. This doesn’t come under the technical language of the rule. <span class=SpellE>Helzberg’s</span> can’t
exercise a claim against Lord’s. But the
shopping center is okay.</span></p>

        <span
          >This is a pretty good illustration of how most courts deal with Rule
          23(a). This case churns through each of the categories of the rule to
          see if the categories are met. That�s what the case suggests, but the
          notes suggest that there is much more of a �peek� at the merits where
          you decide whether you want the case to go ahead. This is especially
          true with the issues of typicality and
          <span class="SpellE">representativeness</span>. What�s at issue in
          this case? There�s a Title IX claim that the Michigan High School
          Athletic Association discriminated against female athletes. The
          Athletic Association fails to sanction certain girls� sports, makes
          girls play non-traditional, shorter seasons, on inferior dates, in
          inferior facilities, and with inadequate resources. They have a bunch
          of complaints.</span

          athletes enrolled in member high schools who participate in

          the way a class will be described, which is by way of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">characteristics</i>. This class
          is quite sweeping. It includes present and future female students. It
          includes those who participated and those who didn�t participate
          because of the discrimination. The class is limited to people who were
          harmed by the defendants� conduct.</span

          because it would become moot at the time an individual female student
          plaintiff graduates. So we have an organization trying to deal with
          the class issues on behalf of all of these female students.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is no problem with <span class="SpellE">numerosity</span> here.
          There are lots and lots of present and future students. There are a
          bunch of common issues of law or fact. Though the different types of
          complaints might apply differently to different individuals, there
          must be at least one issue common to all the class members. What about
          typicality? No one is probably going to suffer all the harms. That�s
          why they let a community group go forward as a collective
          representative. But it is likely they will later add specific, named
          students who suffered some of the specific harms listed. Also, some of
          the class members might have competing interests. The remedy that
          might be crafted might be good for some class members and not others.
          How do we solve the problem? You can divide the class into subclasses
          under Rule 23(c<span class="GramE">)(</span>4)(B). You could have
          subclasses based on people who fall into different subcategories. How
          about <span class="SpellE">representativeness</span>? You wouldn�t be
          part of the class if you�re not adversely affected. That�s why you
          include that language: to avoid
          <span class="SpellE">representativeness</span> problems. Much care
          goes into how you define the group! You can define away all the legal
          problems if you�re careful.</span

        <span
          >There is also the MHSAA. They�ll represent the high schools�
          interests directly. They will be protecting the status quo and all of
          those students who are happy with the way things are now. Wright says
          that as long as there�s a representative for the status quo and one
          for the people who want change, you can maintain a class action.</span

          the girls lose on the merits. Let�s say a new female student moves to </span

        ><span>
          later and sues independently. They would be precluded from suing
          because the lawsuit bound all future students! How can that be? That
          student had no notice! The law says that the student�s interests were
          already adequately represented by the parties in the lawsuit. The
          future student is treated like a party, even without notice.</span

          >What�s happening? The plaintiff leased a car from Sun Trust and sued
          later saying that they didn�t comply with disclosure requirements.
          Heaven sued for statutory damages but no actual damages. She wanted to
          certify a 23(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>3) class. The trust company
          counterclaims, saying that individual class members failed to pay
          their lease. This is similar to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >Plant v. Blazer Financial Services, Inc.</i
          >
          in that if there are compulsory counterclaims, the court says you must
          deny the class certification of the plaintiffs. Is this court bound by
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Plant</i>? Yes, because the
          Eleventh Circuit used to be part of the Fifth Circuit! So the court
          must boot the case for failing to meet the requirement in Rule
          23(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>3) that this class action is superior
          to other ways to adjudicate the dispute. This
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">could </i>go forward as a
          class, but it can�t be maintained under Rule 23(b<span class="GramE"
            >)(</span
          >3). But the Eleventh Circuit adds its own caveat, which is that they
          might have done it differently, but the district court didn�t abuse
          its discretion in booting the whole thing.</span

          up this counterclaim as a defensive measure. Even if the class had
          gone forward, the class plaintiffs probably would have wanted to
          opt-out anyway!</span

          here, the plaintiffs have the right to get a look at this. The suit
          might continue with just the named plaintiffs and not the class. Most
          states are adopting rules like this.</span

        <span
          >There are lots of factors that go into determining settlement values
          and what makes cases ripe for settlement. Discovery causes
          reevaluation of the value of a suit. Most tort plaintiffs lose, so
          settlement for them is attractive. Even if you win, verdicts may be
          low, and trials are expensive. So both sides have pressure to settle
          if possible. Most settlements are based on negotiations between the
          attorneys.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Jane Smart is a botanist employed by a botany company genetically
          modifying crops. There are harassment allegations that lead to a
          discharge. There are multiple stories of what may have happened. But
          Jane thinks she may have both unlawful discharge claims under state
          law and federal Title VII claims. The company tries to give her money
          to not sue, a �walkaway� settlement. This is the easiest way to make
          sure you get sued for malpractice. If you pay someone not to sue but
          then they turn around and sue anyway, then you yourself will turn
          around and sue the lawyer who recommended the �walkaway� settlement.
          So you want to do this in the form of a release. This has its
          problems, too. The release is only as good as its language. If the
          release is �in full settlement of civil rights claims against
          defendants�, then you haven�t necessarily released the unlawful
          discharge claim. What about �in full settlement of any and all claims,
          known and unknown, whether based on federal, state, or other
          applicable law, arising out of my employment�? That�ll do.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Voluntary dismissals are one way to execute a settlement agreement,
          but the problem is that this dismissal is without prejudice, meaning
          that they can file the lawsuit later. Maybe you could get Rule 41(b)
          involuntary dismissal which would be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">with</i> prejudice. Claim
          preclusion will then kick in and preclude whatever such a judgment on
          the merits would have covered. If you want
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">more</i> action on the part of
          the courts, you can ask for a consent decree, which is, in essence, a
          court order.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >All four settlement scenarios described above have their advantages
          and disadvantages. Some will be quicker than others. For example, if
          you have to deal with a consent decree, you�ll have to invoke the
          jurisdiction of the court. Some will be more confidential than others.
          And some will be more enforceable than others. But usually no one type
          of settlement will have all the answers.</span

          settle claims that it could not have tried because of the full faith

          this case by statute.</span

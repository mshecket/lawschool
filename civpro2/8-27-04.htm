        <b><span>The myth of notice pleading</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There�s at least one category of cases that�s handled outside of the
          rubric of the Federal Rules. Courts have imposed heightened pleading
          without any Rules-based justification! The Supreme Court has slapped
          them down twice, in
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Leatherman</i></span
          >
          and
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Swierkiewicz</i></span
          >! What more could the Court do? Why is there a resilience of
          heightened pleading in the civil rights context? This has something to
          do with the pleading burden.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But please note that the Rules aren�t the only place we�ll get
          heightened pleading requirements. For example, the PSLRA gets Congress
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">directly</i> involved in
          creating procedural requirements (as opposed to indirectly through the
          Rules Enabling Act). The statute creates two different burdens: a
          general particularity requirement, which requires the statement with
          particularity of all facts that caused people to be
          <span class="GramE">mislead</span>, and a requirement to plead with
          particularity facts that show the defendant acted with a required
          state of mind. Congress is directly contravening the Federal Rules of
          Civil Procedure! So they make the plaintiff plead the defendant�s
          state of mind!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Congress was motivated to do this because they believe securities
          fraud suits are largely frivolous. They want less of them, and thus
          they make it more difficult to plead them. There�s another provision
          that provides for a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">mandatory discovery stay</i>:
          once a complaint is challenged with a motion to dismiss based on the
          statute, the court must stay all discovery, meaning that there is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">no chance</i> that plaintiffs
          will be able to get enough information to plead specific facts. But
          has the PSLRA decreased the number of securities suits? No. Has it
          increased the quality of the suits?
          <span class="GramE">Maybe.</span> But there�s a three way circuit
          split, and the Supreme Court has twice denied review of the
          issue.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The same particularity requirement as to intent cropped up in the Y2K
          Act. Fairman fears that Congress is using this as a technique to
          discourage certain kinds of lawsuits. So
          <span class="SpellE">proceduralists</span> are annoyed! The Rules are
          usually built up from the �grass roots� instead of being imposed from
          above. Fairman wants Federal Rules that are
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">transsubstantive</i></span
          >
          � that have nothing to do with substantive law. Yeazell thinks that
          Congress is a better choice for making rules, since Congress does
          approve <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">all</i> changes to the
          Federal Rules. But usually they would just accept or reject rules that
          have gone through the whole Rules Enabling Act process. Fairman has no
          confidence in Congress�s ability to get procedure right.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So the classic �notice pleading except for fraud� vision is not
          accurate in practice! But is civil rights an anomaly? No way! There�s
          heightened pleading in antitrust, RICO, conspiracy, copyright,
          negligence, and CERCLA, too! These are both statutory and common law
          causes of action, old and new! This became his second paper. Take
          antitrust, for example. There are cases in the antitrust areas that
          will dismiss complaint for �<span class="SpellE">conclusory</span>
          allegations� or �bare legal conclusions as to the facts�. Every
          jurisdiction has language like this, but the problem is that many
          courts use this as a �euphemism� for heightened pleading! There are
          cases where there are no special pleading requirements for antitrust.
          Other cases carve out a subset, like antitrust conspiracy claims, and
          require heightened pleading as to the object and accomplishments of
          the conspiracy. Fraudulent concealment is dealt with under 9(b) and
          must meet the particularity requirement. More dramatically, some
          courts say you must plead �facts with particularity sufficient to
          support <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">each element</i> of the
          antitrust action�. This is the infamous �<span class="SpellE"
            >hyperpleading</span
          >�! Finally, there can be dismissal for prolixity: too many facts!
          There you have the �pleading circle�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If you trace back where the courts imposed all these different
          heightened pleading requirements, they almost always go back to the
          �germ� of 9(b) and fraud, saying it�s �fraud-like� or arguing that we
          should treat other substantive areas the same way. So Fairman wants to
          eliminate 9(b). He proposes leaving �condition of mind�. So that�s the
          next article! Coming soon!</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The Supreme Court has so muddled the substantive law of qualified
          <span class="GramE">immunity,</span> circuits like the Fifth Circuit
          didn�t know what to do. They looked for other ways to protect
          defendants who they believed were acting properly in their
          offices.</span

          he�s the whistle-blower! He gets moved around,
          <span class="GramE">then</span> fired. Factually, Gomez is the good
          guy and </span

          ><st1:place><span>Toledo</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          is the bad guy. Gomez has been wronged, and he�s going to sue! He sues
          under � 1983 since it�s a government unit that�s doing this to him. He
          sues based on being denied procedural due process. He didn�t get a
          hearing where he could prove his innocence. The defendant moves for
          12(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>6) dismissal for failure to state a
          claim. The basis of the 12(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>6) is that he
          claims bad faith must be pleaded since the defendant has qualified
          immunity. Who has to plead this issue?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >� 1983 deals with deprivation of constitutional rights under color of
          law. It creates a federal cause of action against government actors,
          acting under their authority. But along with this, the Supreme Court
          has imposed the doctrine of qualified immunity, meaning the government
          actors are off the hook if there was an objectively reasonable belief
          that the acts were lawful and that the officer acted with the belief
          that what he was doing was right: both an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">objective</i> and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">subjective</i> component. If
          you have both, you�ll be off the hook. Qualified immunity is always
          raised by a defense by government actors sued under � 1983. So the
          battle here is a pleading battle.</span

          complaint must allege state action, a violation of constitutional
          rights, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and</i> bad faith. The
          Supreme Court agrees with Gomez. The pleading burden ends up,

        ><span
          >, and the Supreme Court agrees with the Gomez view of the world.
          <span class="SpellE">Thurgood</span> Marshall says bad/good faith is
          an affirmative defense. Why? It�s basically just the heightened
          pleading stuff we just talked about! The objective part is easy to
          plead. But how do you plead the subjective part? How do you plead the
          defendant acted with
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">any</i> kind of state of mind?
          How could you sign a complaint under Rule 11 stating the officer�s
          intent? You�ve got to take a deposition to find this out, and that
          happens at discovery! In the aftermath, the knowledge of the facts as
          to good or bad faith lie with </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Toledo</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>, therefore, the Court puts the pleading burden on </span

          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Schultea</i></span
          >: the Fifth Circuit resurrected heightened pleading for qualified
          immunity cases using Rule 7. What if we put the two cases together?
          Gomez files his complaint without qualified immunity in it because the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gomez</i> case says he doesn�t
          have to. </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Toledo</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          would file his answer and state his immunity defense (again, under
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gomez</i>). Then, under

            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Schultea</i></span

          would ask the court to require the plaintiff to reply with
          particularity, the court will so order, and now Gomez is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">even worse off!</i> He has to
          file an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">answer</i> with

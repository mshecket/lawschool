<p><span>We
left off discussing compliance. We could
go over a lot of different problems, but the important stuff is that you need
to look at <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> Rule 37 and Rule
26(c) and (g). Is it better
strategically to seek protective orders to prevent having to answer discovery,
or is it better to object and wait for the other side to file motions to compel
and then raise the same issues you would raise in a protective order? Yeazell says that it’s better not to rush for
the protective order. You might be able
to defuse a discovery dispute that will be enflamed by filing a protective
order motion. <span class=GramE>(But to
whose advantage is such strategy?</span> <span class=GramE>The client?</span> <span class=GramE>The attorney?</span> <span class=GramE>“Justice?”)</span></span></p>

<p><b><span>Discovery and privacy – <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stalnaker</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Kmart Corp.</i></span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a “fair employment practices” case. But it wasn’t reported in the Federal Supplement. It’s a run-of-the-mill case. What has Ms. <span class=SpellE>Stalnaker</span>
done? She has sued </span><st1:place><span
 >Graves</span></st1:place><span> and Kmart for sexual
harassment. She has claimed a hostile
work environment. She’s trying to get
discovery from a bunch of other Kmart employees—she wants to depose them. Kmart objects by filing a protective order
under Rule 26(c). What justifies the use
of a protective order here? The defendants
claim that there is no allegation that the other women had any sexual
relationship with the plaintiff or harassed her. Would the Rules of Evidence allow you to
admit evidence about the past sexual behavior of parties? <span class=GramE>No, in general.</span> But it turns out that what others are doing
in the workplace is relevant. But doesn’t
this seem pretty invasive? There’s a
restriction, though: the results of discovery must be kept secret. The court won’t stop any inquiry about
voluntary conduct with </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
 '>Graves</span></st1:place><span>. What
does this ruling mean? Voluntary
consensual sexual activities with people other than Kmart employees in places
other than at Kmart are irrelevant. Sexual
harassment by </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Graves</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> is relevant, too.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Under
this order, what questions can be asked? How can you phrase a question about sexual activity with </span><st1:place><span
 >Graves</span></st1:place><span> so that it’s not
objectionable? You make the call! To play it safe, make the language as close
to the judge’s order as possible. Did
the third party Kmart employees have their own lawyers? They probably couldn’t afford it. They were just Kmart employees! Kmart tries to keep out the evidence to
protect its own interests. Kmart’s
lawyers may be protecting the deponents’ interests in this case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Can
the magistrate judge’s order be appealed? The discovery order isn’t dispositive of anything except what’s before
you. So generally, there will be no
appellate review of this kind of discovery dispute. But the statute that creates the magistrate judge’s
jurisdiction does have an out for interlocutory review of matters that are “clearly
erroneous”. If the magistrate makes a
really bad mistake, you can ask the district court to review and reverse that
mistake.</span></p>

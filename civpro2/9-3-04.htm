<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The end result here is that
the court requires that there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deemed
admission</i> that PPI is the owner of the forklift, which means, essentially,
they’ll be subject to liability if it can be proved that they were negligent. The judge gives us several reasons for this:
(1) <span class=GramE>It</span> was an ineffective denial under the Rules. A proper denial would have broken down the
component parts, which would have been a signal to the plaintiff that the plaintiff
sued the wrong party. The plaintiff
could have then amended his pleadings. (2)
The judge finds that there was no bad faith. This is often a consideration when judges decide what to do on the
pleadings. What really underlies this
case is the party in interest here: the insurance company, which insures <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> PPI and CCI. As a practical matter, neither defendant will
pay the judgment. The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>insurance company will pay</i>. So it doesn’t really matter who gets
sued! The liability will pass
through. But you can’t ignore all the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure to get to that result: so the judge says that it’s an
ineffective denial. But we can see how this
fact colors the procedural ruling. It
seems like a harsh penalty, but in reality it may not be since the insurance
company pays either way!</span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Affirmative defenses – <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The classic defense is the statute
of limitations. Affirmative defenses
must be set forth affirmatively! There’s
a big list in the rules. If you fail to
set out your defenses in your answer, you can have big problems! </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Bell</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> is laying cable on Layman’s land. She thinks that they’ve trespassed on her
land, causing the value of her land to depreciate. They dug a hole in her land and buried a
cable…hmm. What’s the response of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Bell</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>? They ultimately
claim that they had an easement granted by a previous owner to a predecessor
company. The phone company made a
special denial: it’s a general denial. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Bell</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> denied everything and demanded proof of everything in
the complaint. You can actually do this
in some states! But in federal court,
you can’t just sloppily deny everything. Never do a general denial in federal court! There will be something that you’ve
ineffectively denied that gets admitted! </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Bell</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> wins at trial because of the easement evidence that
the judge lets in. Was that evidence
proper? It depends on whether they
should have told her sooner (in their answer).</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Layman argues her case in the
Court of Appeals. She says that an
easement must be pleaded as an affirmative defense, but it turns out that it’s
not listed in the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> equivalent of the Federal Rule! But we go under the “other matter” phrase of
the rule. The test is that if there are
any facts that would let the defendant avoid <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>any</i> legal responsibility, the defendant must put them in the
answer. That’s the case here! What should have happened is that </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Bell</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> should have had a general denial in their answer,
then their affirmative defense dealing with the easement. Yeazell tries to point out what motivates the
court to find some things as affirmative defenses and other things not
affirmative defenses. Consider the
blueprint for the case: the pleadings spell out to the parties what is at
issue. When you get to the trial, Layman
has no idea that there will be this easement evidence. There is a surprise and notice element
embodied in the court’s application of this rule. These pleading rules are used to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>foster notice</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>avoid surprise</i>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What if easement evidence had
come out in the discovery phase? Then
there would have been no surprise. Layman would have had notice and would have been able to properly proceed
to trial on the merits. The court says
that </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Bell</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> should have said <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>up
front</i> if they had an easement. The
case isn’t tossed out, but rather it’s remanded for a new trial.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Some states, like </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, codify this idea. They require that “all matters, which if not pleaded would be likely to
take the adverse party by surprise or would raise issues of fact not appearing
on the face of a prior pleading” must be in the answer. This gets away from having to characterize
every defense as affirmative or not. So,
if in doubt, plead everything if you’re not sure whether it’s an affirmative defense. If you think you have any colorable argument
for it, list it. You can always drop it
later. But don’t be stupid! You might get Rule 11’d.</span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Amendments</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>These relate both to amending
the complaint and amending the answer. This is in Rule 15. There are
three ways to amend: one way for the plaintiff, one way for the defendant, and
one way the judge can help you out. You
may amend once “as a matter of course” before you get the answer. This is basically a plaintiff’s rule. The plaintiff files a complaint, and you can
amend it once before the answer comes back. If there is no responsive pleading due (like an answer, because there’s
nothing that comes after it), you have 20 days to amend it. Typically, you also have 20 days to answer
the complaint, so it’s kind of a mirrored rule. If you don’t qualify for one of these two windows, you must ask for the
leave of the court, which will be freely given as justice requires. But just what does justice require?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Beeck</span></span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> gets injured by a waterslide. <span class=SpellE>Doh</span>! He sues the manufacturer. He sues <span class=SpellE>Aquaslide</span>
on product liability claims. They bring
in the insurance companies. They all
check out the slides and they’re positive that <span class=SpellE>Aquaslide</span>
really made it. After the lawsuit is
filed, <span class=SpellE>Aquaslide</span> answers, and in the answer they
admit that they make the slide. On the
basis of the insurance companies telling <span class=SpellE>Aquaslide</span>
that it was their slide, they say in discovery that it really was their slide. The statute of limitations runs! Now the president of the company goes to look
at the slide, and lo and behold, it’s not an <span class=SpellE>Aquaslide</span>
after all! In his deposition, he says
so. After the statute of limitations has
run out, <span class=SpellE>Aquaslide</span> wants to amend their answer to
change their response as to whether it was really their slide. They’re obviously out of the 20 day window,
so they have to throw themselves on the mercy of the court! Why didn’t this happen in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zielinski</i>? It turns out that the Rule didn’t exist
then! That would have been the
appropriate procedural remedy if it had existed at the time.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There’s a Supreme Court case on
this: <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Foman</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Davis</i> gives us a test. Leave to amend will be freely given in the absence
of any reason that leave shouldn’t be granted. Courts mustn’t allow <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>delay</i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bad faith</i>, or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>prejudice</i>. Is there a good
reason for why you messed up in the first place? Will fixing it not hurt the other side too
much? They’ll always be hurt some
because <span class=GramE>your</span> being better off always makes them at
least a little worse off. Let’s apply
the law. <span class=SpellE>Aquaslide</span>
is not said to have acted in bad faith because their answer and interrogatory
responses were based on the insurance company, and you’d think that their
investigation would be accurate! The court
says that “blame should be shared equally”…the plaintiff could have made this
discovery in the course of their own investigation…but then again, if the
insurance company couldn’t tell, how could the plaintiffs? Did the plaintiffs really do anything
wrong? There’s a good reason to grant
leave to amend, though.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The plaintiff says that there
is prejudice, though, because the statute of limitations has run! The plaintiff can’t turn around and sue the
true manufacturer for personal injury. But the court says that the plaintiff might have causes of action that
can get around the statute of <span class=GramE>limitations,</span> the court
says that the prejudice isn’t so great as the plaintiff says. There’s a later state court suit filed by the
plaintiffs against <span class=SpellE>Aquaslide</span> for misrepresentation in
their federal pleadings (lying in the federal lawsuit) because it was
discovered that the company knew there were counterfeit slides all over the country! It wasn’t a one time thing! That’s why the president went to go and look:
he knew ahead of time that it might not be their slide. Armed with that knowledge, the state courts
were much more generous with the plaintiffs.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Statute of limitations and relating back</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Absent some absolute cutoff,
you can always beg the court to amend. But if the statute of limitations has run, the cause of action is cut
off. Rule 15(c) talks to us about what
we can do with regard to amending our petitions and having those amendments
relate back to when we initially filed the complaint. This is a tool to get around limitations. If we can get our amendment to relate back,
then we’ve avoided the statute of limitations problem. It will relate back if it relates to the same
“conduct, transaction, or occurrence”. This was an unclear, problematic amendment when it was adopted, but now
there is more clarity about when it applies.</span></p>

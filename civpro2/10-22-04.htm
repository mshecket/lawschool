<p><b><span>Production of documents – <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule34.htm">Rule 34</a></span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is the most expensive part of the discovery process. The Rule itself, though it’s written as “the
inspection of stuff”, has become more “the production of copies of documents”. These documents include computer printouts,
financial records, faxes, and electronic information (such as e-mails). You list things that you want produced, and
you can propound these requests against any party. There is also no limit to your requests for
production. These requests are easy to
propound but expensive and difficult to comply with. The tendency is to ask broadly – to define
the largest possible universe of potential documents with the hope of being
able to score the best possible documents. To request documents against a non-party, you must use a subpoena duces
tecum (“show up and bring stuff with you”) under <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule45.htm">Rule 45</a>. You can combine this with a request to take a
deposition.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a lawyer-driven device. There is a
tendency to interpret requests very literally and narrowly. Unless you ask exactly the right question,
you won’t get exactly the right documents. So the plaintiff’s lawyer starts by propounding requests that will be
very broad. Then the opposing counsel objects,
saying that the requests are overly broad and unduly burdensome. A negotiation begins between the
lawyers. They try to winnow down the
scope of the production by negotiation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Alice</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> sues the city for an
alleged assault by the police. The
specific injury is to the plaintiff’s leg. The police department has a post-accident photograph of the plaintiff at
a dance contest, indicating that the injury may not be quite as severe as the plaintiff
suggests. Does the police department
have to disclose the existence of this photograph under Rule 26(a)? If they fail to disclose, they may not be
able to use it at trial. They probably
have to fork over the photograph if there is a Rule 34 request for production. If you ultimately produce the information
before trial, you can argue that failing to produce it under Rule 26(a) was
harmless, which could avoid sanctions.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
go back to the Albert and Barbara car accident. Say we want some documents from a mechanic. No problem! You use a subpoena. Let’s say we
want to have a medical exam of Barbara because she’s counterclaiming. Is a court likely to grant a Rule 35 request
for a medical exam when the other party is claiming physical injuries? If courts will ever do this, this is the
situation where they will. Courts are
generally reluctant to upset parties’ privacy by ordering such examinations. If you get a medical exam ordered by the court
and they request a copy of it, disclosure of other medical reports both before
and after that one may follow. You can’t
hide behind privilege once you’ve turned over these documents.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Requests for admissions –
Rule 36</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>You
ask the other party to admit stuff. Admissions aren’t very useful because they are drafted by lawyers and
answered by lawyers. But watch out! Failure to answer is harmful both in Rule 37
compliance, and even worse, if you forget to answer then the matter is deemed
admitted within 30 days. Don’t forget
about these things!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The intersection between
Rules 37 and 26</span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>These
are both tools that may be used in certain contexts depending on whether the
facts of the situation make each Rule applicable. Rule 26(g) is kind of like a mini version of
Rule 11. There are sanctions imposed for
an attorney having signed discovery requests that are “bad” for whatever reason
(e.g. timeliness). But note that Rule 11
doesn’t apply to discovery. The typical
sanction under Rule 26(g) will be the fees associated with having to respond to
the request. What if we wait until after
the discovery conference, and then you think it’s still too soon? You can use Rule 26(c) to get a protective
order to try to prevent the use of the deposition because you think it’s
premature. You use Rule 37 when the
other side fails to disclose something and they try to introduce it at trial. Rule 37 says that if they failed to disclose,
then they don’t get to use the person or fact in the trial. There are more bad things in Rule 37(b)(2):
facts can be deemed established, evidence can be banned, and pleadings may be
struck.</span></p>

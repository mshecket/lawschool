<p><b><span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Discovery
is the method by which a party to a lawsuit, or other potential parties, obtain
information and preserve it for trial.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are lots and lots of rules with lots of detail.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The discovery process is one of the most
important innovations of the Federal Rules.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Discovery includes rules related to disclosures, requests for
production, depositions, interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests
for mental or physical exams.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Rule 37
is the sanction motion, used to get people to comply with the rules of
discovery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>In
2000, we had our last series of changes to the Rules related to discovery.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They used to relate the scope of discovery to
the “subject matter” of the action, but that was seen as too broad.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Rules were changed to indicate that the
scope of discovery should be defined to claims and defenses as served in the
pleadings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The intent is to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>limit</i> discovery.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some said that these amendments wouldn’t lead
to much change, and experience has shown that they were basically right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><b><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>This
case takes place in the Northern District of Illinois, and a magistrate judge
is writing the opinion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These judges
handle a lot of discovery matters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
this case, African-American and Latino workers sue this company for Title VII
violations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They complain that they were
discriminated against and that they experienced a hostile work environment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What information do the plaintiffs want?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are trying to get information about
other employees’ complaints.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case
comes up before the court on a motion to compel under Rule 37.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under Rule 26(b), parties may obtain
discovery under any matter not privileged that is relevant to the claim or defense.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Are other people’s complaints relevant to
these plaintiffs’ claims?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The key is
that to have a hostile work environment, it must be widespread.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if there are other complaints, it tends to
show that there is widespread hostility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is what the Rule was designed to bring in as discoverable!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What would have happened under the old “subject
matter” Rule?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would have been the
same, and it’s hard to see what the big change is in practice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the end, the complaints are deemed
properly discoverable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Steffan v.
Cheney</span></i></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Steffan
was “constructively discharged” from the Navy for proclaiming himself gay.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the discovery problem?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Navy was deposing him and wanted to know
if he had engaged in homosexual conduct while he was a midshipman.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Steffan refused to answer on Fifth Amendment
grounds (which you can do in a civil matter as well as a criminal matter).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does the Navy do?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They file a motion to compel Steffan to
answer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They also file a request for
sanctions (including simply dismissing the case).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Steffan argues that the questions that he’s
being asked are not relevant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district
court judge doesn’t buy it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Steffan
refuses to answer, and the case is dismissed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then he appeals to the D.C. Circuit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The only reason there is a right to appeal on this discovery issue is
that he’s been poured out of court entirely.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He appeals his dismissal on the grounds that the discovery ruling and
sanction were wrong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Compare this to the
previous case: there was no appeal of the discovery ruling until the entire
case is finished, at which point the standard for review is whether the
discovery ruling caused you to lose the case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So most action on discovery is at the district court level.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
Court of Appeals says that the question is not relevant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The original administrative proceeding was
based only on his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>statements</i> and not
his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>conduct</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Rule here says that discovery is relevant
if it relates to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>claims</i> or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>defenses</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Steffan claimed that he was discharged because
he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>said </i>he was gay, not because of
any conduct.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does that make sense?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Are they splitting hairs here?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They take a very <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>narrow</i> view of the “claims or defenses” standard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Evidence as to discovery is a case-specific
issue, and that’s why there is so much litigation over discovery disputes:
there is so much to work with.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is this
good policy?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It drives up the cost of litigation
because discovery is, by far, the most expensive part of the lawsuit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It can give one side a strategic advantage in
the lawsuit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>A hypothetical</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>We
have Albert and Barbara.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Albert sues
Barbara for negligence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Albert wants to
discover how much money Barbara has.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can
he do that?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, because it’s not
relevant to whether she was negligent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The claim is for negligence, and the amount of money that the person you’ve
sued has to pay you if you win is not one of the elements of negligence and is
thus not discoverable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do</i> want to find out how much money
people have.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if your claim is for
an intentional tort?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because punitive
damages are part of the law that goes along with the intentional tort and part
of the recovery that you request, courts will find that how much money the
other person has is relevant as to punitive damages.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is why when you sue a company for an intentional
tort you get to find out how much the company is worth: you craft a punitive
damages award that will hurt them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>What
if the defendant is insured and you have a simple negligence action?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If I can’t find out how much money you have
in the bank, why can I get your insurance coverage information?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s actually a Rule, 26(a)(1)(D), that
says you are required to disclose whether you’re carrying insurance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not because it’s relevant to the claim
or defense, but rather it’s so integral to this lawsuit that we force you to
disgorge the information as soon as the lawsuit is filed.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

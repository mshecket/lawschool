          >We left off with the short story of pleading. The bottom line is that
          Rule 8 is �notice pleading�. Notice should be sufficient to withstand
          a motion to dismiss. It�s possible to have a statement that�s too
          long. A complaint could be so detailed that a court could dismiss it
          on the basis of prolixity. A 4,000 page complaint is too damn much!
          Notice that you can
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">plead inconsistently</i>. It�s
          provided for in Rule 8(e)(2). You can set forth alternate or
          hypothetical statements of claims or defenses regardless of
          consistency. This may make us uneasy that we can plead things that are
          internally inconsistent. But </span

        <span
          >Yesterday, we looked at the plight of Haddle. Haddle lost in the
          trial court because the law of the circuit said that he had no
          property interest in his continued employment. What if the law said
          that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had</i> a property
          interest if the company had promised it would only terminate him for
          cause? In other words, he�s still in an at-will state, but the company
          has promised only to fire him for cause. Could Haddle amend his
          pleading to avoid 12(b)(6)? Shouldn�t he have thought of that the
          first time around? Why can�t he make that point going forward, though?
          But we don�t know whether the company promised him he would only be
          dismissed for cause. You can�t just lie to get past 12(b)(6).</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule 11</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Rule 11 is a long rule. Every
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">piece of paper </i>filed in a
          court shall be signed by at least one attorney or pro se party. Stuff
          that�s filed has to be signed! The reason it�s important comes in
          11(b): you assert that you�ve done a reasonable investigation and you,
          in good faith, think you�re properly filing the document. You can�t
          harass or delay! You have to have non-frivolous claims! You have to
          have facts that can be supported by evidence! There is a tension in
          the Rules: plead quickly and get the lawsuit started,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">but</i> Rule 11 says that you
          must have done reasonable investigation first.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>What are the consequences? The
          court can impose sanctions! Attorneys, firms, or parties can be
          sanctioned. Rule 11(c) sets out a detailed process for how we do
          this.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >You can mostly just read Rule 11 and you�ll get it. If it ain�t filed
          with the court, it ain�t a Rule 11 violation! If there�s no document,
          or it�s not filed, or there�s no court�no violation. What about
          groundless discovery? Rule 11 doesn�t apply to discovery! There�s a
          different part of the Rules that deal with discovery abuses: Rule 26.
          The penalty scheme there is different. What about a client who brings
          in a frivolous lawsuit and you rush to file it? The attorney can get
          knocked for Rule 11(b)(3). It looks like there was no investigation!
          You need an �inquiry reasonable under the circumstances�. That means
          you might be off the hook if the client comes to you when the statute
          of limitations is almost over. If you only have a day to file the
          lawsuit, they might go easier on you.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >This is a case of lawyers failing to investigate the law, which isn�t
          that common. The lawyer filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming
          diversity. We must have
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">complete</i> diversity. The
          Walkers are from </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>South Dakota</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>, and Norwest is from </span

          ><st1:place><span>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. The problem is that they said that the plaintiffs and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">some</i> of the defendants were
          from different states, and some of them were actually from </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>South Dakota</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> as well. Oops!!! Having a </span

        ><span>
          defendant will violate the rule of complete diversity. This is an
          interpretation of 28 U.S.C. � 1332. On the face of the complaint,
          there�s no federal jurisdiction. Norwest sent the plaintiff�s lawyer
          notice of this. They try to be nice about it. Massey ignores them,
          basically. Norwest files a motion to dismiss and a motion for Rule 11
          sanctions.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why does Massey argue that Rule 11 sanctions are inappropriate here?
          He says it would be too hard to figure out where the defendants are
          from! Tough, dude! Plaintiffs have managed to do this basically
          forever. So the argument is stupid on its face. It�s not surprising
          the sanctions were affirmed given that that�s the extent of his
          argument.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Pay attention to what Norwest does. They�re represented by
          sophisticated litigation counsel. Do they follow appropriate
          procedure? Rule 11(c)(1)(A) tells us that we initiate sanctions by
          motion after we first give the other party 21 days to withdraw their
          motion. Norwest sent the guy a letter. They didn�t really
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">serve</i> him. Norwest appears
          to have messed up! To do this right, they should have drafted its
          motion for Rule 11 sanctions, served it on Massey, waited 21 days, see
          if he dismissed the lawsuit, and only
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">then</i> file the motion with
          the court. This is the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">safe harbor</i> provision. It
          tries to let lawyers work these issues out without taking up the
          court�s time. So how do we get an affirmation of the sanctions?
          Luckily, there�s another bit, Rule 11(c)(1)(B), which lets the court
          impose sanctions sua sponte. Did the district court issue a show cause
          order? We don�t know. Law firms can have their own Rule 11 procedure.
          You would have to get your Rule 11 motions approved by your firm�s
          ethics committee.</span

        <span
          >There are dates stamped on the back of Barbies� heads! If the
          plaintiff�s attorney had done even the most basic research, he would
          have found that the suit was absolutely meritless. The plaintiff�s
          attorney, Hicks, did lots and lots of stuff wrong. Why would Mattel
          have pursued the strategy it pursued? It files its motion for summary
          judgment first and then files for Rule 11 sanctions as opposed to
          filing for Rule 11 sanctions first and getting the lawsuit dismissed.
          This massively runs up the bill, where you could have had the same
          result much faster and cheaper. But Mattel wants to send a message:
          don�t screw with us. They
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">chose</i> a more expensive and
          protracted strategy. This is similar to how WalMart vigorously
          litigates slip-and-fall cases. The district court�s Rule 11 orders are
          vacated! The district court, in all its excitement, imposed sanctions
          for stuff that you can�t impose sanctions on under Rule 11. You can
          only be sanctioned for the filing of improper papers! The district
          court goes beyond that in its justification. Hicks gets a short term
          victory in the Court of Appeals, but he�ll get hammered when it goes
          back to the district court. It�s a victory, in the long haul, for
          Mattel. Mattel made a mistake when they offered up all these different
          grounds for Rule 11, including some that weren�t right.</span

        <span
          >The bottom line is that Rule 11 provides a way to control the
          behavior of lawyers based on the filing of documents in court. It�s a
          good rule! Do you factual investigation!</span

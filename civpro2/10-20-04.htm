        <span
          >Say Albert sues Barbara for an intentional tort. Let�s say Barbara
          gets asked in a deposition whether Barbara intentionally hit Albert.
          Is it relevant? <span class="GramE">Of course.</span> Is this
          information privileged? Is there a privilege that might be raised?
          Sure, she could plead the Fifth Amendment. But this is a civil suit.
          She�s not being tried of anything. Why can she use that privilege?
          Even though this is a civil case, what is said in the civil case is a
          statement that can be used in other actions, civil or criminal,
          against Barbara. This is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">precisely</i> where you want to
          raise the Fifth Amendment to avoid offering up free incriminating
          evidence to the state.</span

        <span
          >Let�s say Albert is claiming damages for emotional distress. Let�s
          say Barbara�s counsel wants to question Albert�s doctor about his
          emotional state. It�s relevant. Though usually there is a confidential
          relationship between doctor and patient, this will probably be an
          exception to that privilege. Albert put his own health at issue: he
          can�t hide behind the privilege and not have to answer
          questions.</span

        <span
          >Rule 26(a) deals with disclosures. You must disclose the contact
          information of people who might have useful information. You must
          disclose any key documents you�re using to support your claim or
          defense, such as the contract in a contract dispute or a codicil in a
          will dispute. You must show a calculation of your damages. You also
          have to provide copies of any insurance agreements, even though such
          agreements aren�t typically admissible as evidence. All of this stuff
          must be coughed up within 14 days of the Rule 26(f) conference. Date
          counting is very important! Prior to the 2000 revisions, the
          disclosure Rule was optional, and virtually every District Court opted
          out of enforcing this Rule. Now it�s mandatory and it actually plays a
          role in answers questions of what is and is not properly
          <span class="SpellE">disclosable</span> at the start of a
          lawsuit.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s say that Albert has medical records that will support his
          injuries and damages. He has wage statements which are used to support
          claims of lost wages. He has information that he was about to be fired
          from his job. He has a poor driving record. He probably has to fork
          over both the medical records and the wage statements. The witness
          must be mentioned if he will be used. How about Barbara? She has an
          insurance policy. She has a mechanic and a boss. She had a fight with
          her boss on the way to work. There is also another eyewitness who will
          claim that Albert is at fault. But that eyewitness has substance abuse
          issues. Who and what do we disclose? Barbara must disclose her
          insurance policy. The mechanic might be a good witness to claim that
          the car was in good working order. We don�t want to disclose the boss.
          But what about the drunk witness? We�re not sure whether we want to
          use that witness or not. If you�re going to use the witness, you must
          disclose the witness. Are the things that we don�t disclose not
          discoverable? They may be discoverable even if it�s not necessary to
          disclose them.</span

        <span
          >Say your client is a used-car salesman. The customer thinks she�s
          made a deal, but the salesman doesn�t agree. The customer sues for
          breach of contract. What disclosures would we have to make? We
          wouldn�t have to disclose anything, but maybe we would say that the
          salesman himself is a person with knowledge of claims and defenses.
          You could also list yourself as a person with knowledge of the claims
          and defenses. So disclosures are mandatory, but they may not create
          any burden in a particular case. On the other hand, what does the
          plaintiff have to disclose? The plaintiff would have to disclose some
          kind of damage computation.</span

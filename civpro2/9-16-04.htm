          >We have jurisdictional problems! A plaintiff may assert any claim
          against a third-party defendant that arises under the same transaction
          or occurrence. After summary judgment, the power company has dropped
          out, and all that�s left is the claim against Owen. But there is
          testimony that Owen actually has its principal place of business in </span

          on both sides of the �v�. What do we do? Isn�t this just a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Zielinski</i> issue? The court
          in that case considered it �deemed admitted� that the defendant owned
          and operated the forklift in question. Why can�t we do that here? The
          lower courts try to stick it to Owen due to deficiencies in their
          pleading and strategy. The Rules tell us that subject matter
          jurisdiction can be raised as an issue
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">at any time</i>, including at
          trial. How do we balance a Rule that says this is a favored defense
          against the charge that Owen was trying to be manipulative and mislead
          the other party until the statute of limitations had run?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What should the court do in this situation? On the one hand, the
          federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. If the court
          doesn�t have subject matter jurisdiction over the case, theoretically
          the court has no power over the defendant. It�s all a matter of
          whether the court will give substance to that rule of law or try to
          ease out of it. The Supreme Court views it as a diversity issue. But
          recall the source of diversity jurisdiction: Article III gives the
          federal courts power to try cases �between citizens of different
          States�. It doesn�t say anything about complete diversity. Statutory
          jurisdiction comes from 28 U.S.C. � 1332, which has the same language.
          But decisions like
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Strawbridge</i> give us the
          rule of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">complete</i> diversity,
          where we interpret the statute to mean that you can�t have a party on
          one side <span class="GramE">who</span> is from the same state as the
          other. Justice Stewart says that this is different from the Rule 14
          issue in that here we have a non-federal claim asserted by the
          plaintiff that could have all been brought in state court. When you
          use impleader, you may not have other options because you weren�t the
          master of the complaint.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >All of this answer that we get from
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Owen v. Kroger</i> is later
          codified by the supplemental jurisdiction statute: 28 U.S.C. � 1367.
          It�s difficult. The general rule is that there
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">is</i> supplemental
          jurisdiction over claims and parties that are part of the same case or
          controversy in a constitutional sense. This includes joinder of
          additional parties. That�s an efficiency rule. What makes the statute
          difficult is that this is the general grant of power that is then
          restricted as to certain types of claims brought in certain types of
          ways. Subsection (b) takes away certain types of jurisdiction. You
          can�t get supplemental jurisdiction when jurisdiction is based only on
          28 U.S.C. � 1332 (diversity jurisdiction) and when you�re trying to
          join up people (in certain ways, like Rule 14, 19, 20, and 24) who
          would destroy complete diversity. So (a) says that you have
          supplemental jurisdiction over claims and parties, but (b) says that
          if you don�t have diversity, you don�t have supplemental jurisdiction,
          as long as you�re within certain categories.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So the intent of Congress was to codify the result of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Owen v. Kroger</i>. How did
          they do? In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Owen</i>, all the
          claims arise from the same case or controversy. We could have three
          different cases if we wanted to, but it�s more efficient to put them
          all together. What about <span class="SpellE">OPPD�s</span> claim
          against Owen? The statute generally says that we�ll grant jurisdiction
          for anything that comes from the same case or controversy,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">but</i> it�s a diversity case,
          and you don�t have supplemental jurisdiction over claims made by
          plaintiffs against third parties. But this is a claim by a defendant,
          so there�s no problem! What if Kroger had a federal question claim she
          could raise against Owen, like a federal statute about the operation
          of cranes? Could she bring that claim? � 1367 says this isn�t based
          solely on � 1332, so it�s good!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if Owen sues Kroger for vandalizing the crane? The defendant can
          certainly plead that claim, and � 1367(b) wouldn�t get in the way
          because it�s not the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">plaintiff�s</i> claim. It�s a
          claim by a third-party defendant against a plaintiff, which doesn�t
          fall into any of the � 1367(b) excluded categories. Therefore, it must
          be okay! If that�s okay, can Kroger then bring the wrongful death
          claim? Is it a compulsory counterclaim? Check out the statute. Yeazell
          says that Kroger is now acting as a defendant, but Fairman says that
          the statute doesn�t allow this. Kroger is still a plaintiff! It looks
          like the wrongful death claim is still a claim made by a plaintiff
          against a person made a party under Rule 14. This is one of the big
          problems of the statute: plaintiffs� defensive claims barred by �
          1367(b). It doesn�t make any sense for them to be precluded, because
          the plaintiff was acting as if it were a defendant.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Say we have a plaintiff from </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Ohio</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span>
          with a state negligence claim against a Texan. Let�s say the plaintiff
          uses Rule 20(a) to join another co-plaintiff from </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          who then turns around and asserts another state negligence claim
          against the </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          defendant. This can�t be possible! This is the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">absolute subversion</i> of
          complete diversity. The original lawsuit is okay,
          <span class="GramE">then</span> you add someone later who will mess up
          complete diversity. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">But</i>,
          according to � 1367, this is allowed! This is a claim made
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">by</i> a party joined under the
          Rules against the defendant! Weird! It�s not a claim by a plaintiff
          against a person made a party under Rule 20. It�s a claim by a
          plaintiff against a defendant! Had the drafters of the statute thought
          about it, they would have included this situation. This is the
          so-called �gaping hole�! No court has ever allowed this to go forward.
          It has always been rejected on the ground that it�s so gross a
          violation of the concept of complete diversity that no matter how
          clear the statute seems on its face, decisions like
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Strawbridge</i> don�t allow it.
          There are concerns about this, though.</span

          hard to put together diversity class action unless they�re
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">major</i> mass torts. The
          problem is that the statute doesn�t say anything about Rule 23. The
          way it�s constructed, you would only need one person to meet the
          $75,000 requirement, and then you could just bring in everyone else as
          supplemental. The legislative history of the statute actually says
          that they want to preserve the rule of
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Zahn</i></span
          >. But the statute doesn�t say this! The Fourth, Fifth, Seventh,
          Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have said
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Zahn</i></span
          ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </i>is no longer good law
          after � 1367. The First, Third, Eighth and Tenth Circuits say
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Zahn</i></span
          >
          is still good. The Sixth Circuit sided with the Circuits that say it�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> good law. Fairman
          blames the sloppy statute drafters!</span

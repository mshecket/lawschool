Pro 2 Notes </span><st1:date Year="2004" Day="22" Month="9"><span
 style='font-size:14.0pt;'>9/22/04</span></st1:date><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>We
left off with Rule 19 and “necessary and indispensable parties”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rule 19(a) says they must be someone you can’t
go without.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they meet this category
and can be joined, they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are</i> joined,
as long as there is no jurisdiction problem.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But the problem is what happens if they destroy jurisdiction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the first case, the court skipped over the
(a) inquiry altogether and went to the (b) inquiry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s wrong, and we learn this from the Court
of Appeals, which tells us that joint tortfeasors are never indispensable
parties.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we know that a husband and
wife would be indispensable parties for this purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Another
example would be when there is a dad who set up a trust for himself and his
kids, and the dad wants to sue the trustee for trust abuse.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Are the kids Rule 19 parties?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if the kids are already adults?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can complete relief be given in the kids’ absence?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Will there be multiple or inconsistent obligations without the
kids?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about impeding the kids’ interests?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It may depend on how we classify the various interests.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The kids <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are</i>
Rule 19 parties, because the dad could ask for some kind of relief that would
affect the income stream at the expense of the remainder of the corpus of the
trust, which would in turn affect the kids’ remainder.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>We
ended up with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Helzberg’s</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no question that its interests
would be impeded if Lord’s was in the case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They sue the mall, not the other jewelry store.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no question that the other jewelry store
is a necessary party, but, in equity, should the action proceed or be
dismissed?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could also transfer to
another venue that would be more appropriate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The court could allow the lawsuit to go forward if it could cobble
together ways to limit the prejudice against the parties.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this case, the court decided that the mall
got itself into its own mess, and it can sort it out itself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The conclusion is that Lord’s is a Rule 19
party that can’t be joined, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>however</i>,
the lawsuit is allowed to go forward.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Intervention – Rule 24</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Rule
19 has to do with what we do with parties who somebody wants to bring in from
outside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rule 24 has to do with
outsiders butting in to a lawsuit where <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nobody</i>
wants them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Rule has two parts: a
mandatory part and a permissive part.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There’s 24(a), intervention of right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you’re <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>timely</i>, you <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shall</i> be allowed to intervene where you
claim an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>interest </i>such that if you’re
left out that interest could be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>impaired</i>,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless</i> you’re already <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>adequately represented </i>by someone who is
already there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To intervene <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>permissively</i> under Rule 24(b) when your
claim has a question in common with the main action (a very soft standard!).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>If
a court wants someone to intervene, they can almost always create a
justification under Rule 24(b), because there will almost always be some common
question of law or fact.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district
court will almost never be reversed on appeal because the standard of review is
abuse of discretion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is not a
whole lot of litigation activity in the 24(b) area that’s helpful to understand
the Rule.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have a relatively soft
standard that is efficiency-driven and is very hard to overturn.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So much of the litigation activity is in
24(a): what happens if someone wants to intervene as of right and is denied,
and then argues on appeal that they were wrongly kept out?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Here
the activity is in Rule 24(a).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
happened?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are lots of potential
parties here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The NRDC (an environmental
group) is suing to keep the NRC from issuing licenses to run uranium mills
without first preparing environmental impact statements.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The NRDC also sues the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>New Mexico</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> equivalent agency.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The group tells them that they have to do
their job!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kerr-McGee is a uranium
miner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s also the American Mining Congress,
United Nuclear, and a bunch of other companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They want licenses!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They want to
intervene!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They argue that the people
who will be affected by the decision don’t have their interests represented.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district court says yes to United
Nuclear, but they keep everyone else out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Kerr-McGee and the American Mining Congress appeal, and the others don’t.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>What’s
different about United Nuclear than the other parties?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district court only let that one party
in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are the company that already
was granted a license before the suit started.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The court argues that the other companies are adequately represented by United
Nuclear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The NRDC is trying to enjoin
the issuance of that license because it was issued without an environmental
impact statement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was the event
that led to the lawsuit in the first place!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So United Nuclear could really be affected!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s no wonder they’re included.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Why
was Kerr-McGee rejected?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a practical
matter, their interests must be impaired.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was argued that Kerr-McGee wasn’t a party to the lawsuit, therefore
they wouldn’t be bound by any decisions made in the lawsuit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They would arguably be free to litigate the
same issue in their own suit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district
court accepts this argument, and the Court of Appeals rejects it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court of Appeals notices that, as a
practical matter, even though Kerr-McGee isn’t bound, it’s unlikely that the Tenth
Circuit would come to a different conclusion in a similar lawsuit as to a
different company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Tenth Circuit
will use stare decisis to decide the subsequent cases!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s the sort of “practical” impairment courts
look for.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But why isn’t Kerr-McGee
adequately represented by United Nuclear?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They’re different because one has a license and the other is only a
prospective licensee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe United
Nuclear would be willing to settle the other mining companies out for their own
benefit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The divergence of interest need
not be great to say that one party doesn’t represent the other.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court doesn’t seem to put a lot of weight
on this prong, according to Fairman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>So
why wasn’t the American Mining Congress allowed to intervene?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’re the trade association for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> the mining companies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don’t they have the most interest involved
here?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It doesn’t matter if the court
says environmental impact studies are required!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They’re not a business, they’re a trade association.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do
</i>have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i> interest, and it may be
more broad-based than the other potential parties.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Will that interest be impaired?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sure, to the extent that they are the
representatives of a constituency.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Are
they adequately represented in the suit?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The district court says no way, but the Tenth Circuit brings them in to
represent all kinds of mining companies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Gulf,
Anaconda, and Phillips didn’t appeal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
they had appealed, what would the Tenth Circuit have done?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would depend on whether they were
adequately represented because there’s no question that they have an interest
that could be impaired.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have a big
company, a small company, a company with a license, a company without a
license, and a trade association to represent all the others.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But why not just bring them all in?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other companies are defendant interveners
who are trying to prevent the environmental impact studies from having to be
performed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The most entities you get,
the more likely you’ll get extraneous issues creeping into your lawsuit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So it’s not surprising that Gulf, Anaconda
and Phillips don’t appeal, because Kerr-McGee or the trade association could
represent their interests.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’re
better off taking the free ride!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>This
is typical of Rule 24(a) action in public law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What if someone is hurt at a stadium fireworks show and sues the
stadium, and then another person wants to intervene as a plaintiff?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The second person won’t be bound by the first
lawsuit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if the outcome of the first
lawsuit was that the stadium wasn’t negligent, it could have implications for
the second, third and fourth lawsuits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But no judge would allow the second person to intervene in the lawsuit
because it’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>private</i> litigation!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The courts are much less likely to allow
intervention by strangers in private lawsuits than in public lawsuits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

          >We left off with Rule 19 and �necessary and indispensable parties�.
          Rule 19(a) says they must be someone you can�t go without. If they
          meet this category and can be joined, they
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">are</i> joined, as long as
          there is no jurisdiction problem. But the problem is what happens if
          they destroy jurisdiction. In the first case, the court skipped over
          the (a) inquiry altogether and went to the (b) inquiry. That�s wrong,
          and we learn this from the Court of Appeals, which tells us that joint
          tortfeasors are never indispensable parties. But we know that a
          husband and wife would be indispensable parties for this
          purpose.</span

        <span
          >Another example would be when there is a dad who set up a trust for
          himself and his kids, and the dad wants to sue the trustee for trust
          abuse. Are the kids Rule 19 parties? What if the kids are already
          adults? Can complete relief be given in the kids� absence? Sure. Will
          there be multiple or inconsistent obligations without the kids? No.
          What about impeding the kids� interests? It may depend on how we
          classify the various interests. The kids
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">are</i> Rule 19 parties,
          because the dad could ask for some kind of relief that would affect
          the income stream at the expense of the remainder of the corpus of the
          trust, which would in turn affect the kids� remainder.</span

        <span
          >We ended up with
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Helzberg�s</i>. There was no
          question that its interests would be impeded if Lord�s was in the
          case. They sue the mall, not the other jewelry store. There is no
          question that the other jewelry store is a necessary party, but, in
          equity, should the action proceed or be dismissed? You could also
          transfer to another venue that would be more appropriate. The court
          could allow the lawsuit to go forward if it could cobble together ways
          to limit the prejudice against the parties. In this case, the court
          decided that the mall got itself into its own mess, and it can sort it
          out itself. The conclusion is that Lord�s is a Rule 19 party that
          can�t be joined, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">however</i>,
          the lawsuit is allowed to go forward.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Rule 19 has to do with what we do with parties who somebody wants to
          bring in from outside. Rule 24 has to do with outsiders butting in to
          a lawsuit where
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">nobody</i> wants them. The Rule
          has two parts: a mandatory part and a permissive part. There�s 24(a),
          intervention of right. If you�re
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">timely</i>, you
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">shall</i> be allowed to
          intervene where you claim an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">interest </i>such that if
          you�re left out that interest could be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">impaired</i>,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">unless</i> you�re already
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">adequately represented </i>by
          someone who is already there. To intervene
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">permissively</i> under Rule
          24(b) when your claim has a question in common with the main action (a
          very soft standard!).</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If a court wants someone to intervene, they can almost always create
          a justification under Rule 24(b), because there will almost always be
          some common question of law or fact. The district court will almost
          never be reversed on appeal because the standard of review is abuse of
          discretion. There is not a whole lot of litigation activity in the
          24(b) area that�s helpful to understand the Rule. You have a
          relatively soft standard that is efficiency-driven and is very hard to
          overturn. So much of the litigation activity is in 24(a): what happens
          if someone wants to intervene as of right and is denied, and then
          argues on appeal that they were wrongly kept out?</span

        <span
          >Here the activity is in Rule 24(a). What happened? There are lots of
          potential parties here. The NRDC (an environmental group) is suing to
          keep the NRC from issuing licenses to run uranium mills without first
          preparing environmental impact statements. The NRDC also sues the </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>New Mexico</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          equivalent agency. The group tells them that they have to do their
          job! Kerr-McGee is a uranium miner. There�s also the American Mining
          Congress, United Nuclear, and a bunch of other companies. They want
          licenses! They want to intervene! They argue that the people who will
          be affected by the decision don�t have their interests represented.
          The district court says yes to United Nuclear, but they keep everyone
          else out. Kerr-McGee and the American Mining Congress appeal, and the
          others don�t.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s different about United Nuclear than the other parties? The
          district court only let that one party in. They are the company that
          already was granted a license before the suit started. The court
          argues that the other companies are adequately represented by United
          Nuclear. The NRDC is trying to enjoin the issuance of that license
          because it was issued without an environmental impact statement. That
          was the event that led to the lawsuit in the first place! So United
          Nuclear could really be affected! It�s no wonder they�re
          included.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why was Kerr-McGee rejected? As a practical matter, their interests
          must be impaired. It was argued that Kerr-McGee wasn�t a party to the
          lawsuit, therefore they wouldn�t be bound by any decisions made in the
          lawsuit. They would arguably be free to litigate the same issue in
          their own suit. The district court accepts this argument, and the
          Court of Appeals rejects it. The Court of Appeals notices that, as a
          practical matter, even though Kerr-McGee isn�t bound, it�s unlikely
          that the Tenth Circuit would come to a different conclusion in a
          similar lawsuit as to a different company. The Tenth Circuit will use
          stare decisis to decide the subsequent cases! That�s the sort of
          �practical� impairment courts look for. But why isn�t Kerr-McGee
          adequately represented by United Nuclear? They�re different because
          one has a license and the other is only a prospective licensee. Maybe
          United Nuclear would be willing to settle the other mining companies
          out for their own benefit. The divergence of interest need not be
          great to say that one party doesn�t represent the other. The court
          doesn�t seem to put a lot of weight on this prong, according to
          Fairman.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So why wasn�t the American Mining Congress allowed to intervene?
          They�re the trade association for
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">all</i> the mining companies.
          Don�t they have the most interest involved here? It doesn�t matter if
          the court says environmental impact studies are required! They�re not
          a business, they�re a trade association. They
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">do </i>have
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">some</i> interest, and it may
          be more broad-based than the other potential parties. Will that
          interest be impaired? Sure, to the extent that they are the
          representatives of a constituency. Are they adequately represented in
          the suit? The district court says no way, but the Tenth Circuit brings
          them in to represent all kinds of mining companies.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Gulf, Anaconda, and Phillips didn�t appeal. If they had appealed,
          what would the Tenth Circuit have done? It would depend on whether
          they were adequately represented because there�s no question that they
          have an interest that could be impaired. We have a big company, a
          small company, a company with a license, a company without a license,
          and a trade association to represent all the others. But why not just
          bring them all in? The other companies are defendant interveners who
          are trying to prevent the environmental impact studies from having to
          be performed. The most entities you get, the more likely you�ll get
          extraneous issues creeping into your lawsuit. So it�s not surprising
          that Gulf, Anaconda and Phillips don�t appeal, because Kerr-McGee or
          the trade association could represent their interests. They�re better
          off taking the free ride!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This is typical of Rule 24(a) action in public law. What if someone
          is hurt at a stadium fireworks show and sues the stadium, and then
          another person wants to intervene as a plaintiff? The second person
          won�t be bound by the first lawsuit. But if the outcome of the first
          lawsuit was that the stadium wasn�t negligent, it could have
          implications for the second, third and fourth lawsuits. But no judge
          would allow the second person to intervene in the lawsuit because it�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">private</i> litigation! The
          courts are much less likely to allow intervention by strangers in
          private lawsuits than in public lawsuits.</span

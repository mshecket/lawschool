          had a bad result in surgery, and she sues Dr. Baker. Her cause of
          action is for lack of informed consent: she claims that he didn�t
          explain to her adequately what the risks involved in the surgery were.
          What happened after the cause of action was filed? The statute of
          limitations ran out! Then Baker filed a motion for summary judgment.
          The plaintiff now wants to file her motion to amend her cause of
          action under Rule 15(c) to include a cause of action for simple
          negligence. Rule 15(c) tells us that amendments relate back to the
          date of the original pleading when the claim or defense asserted arose
          out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence.

          to the original complaint because there was no negligence mentioned in
          the original complaint. The doctor wasn�t on notice that he had a
          negligence claim against him! The concept behind pleading is that we
          put you on notice. But all the doctor knew about was the claim
          involving informed consent.</span

          >The plaintiff was injured while playing basketball at the rehab
          center. He slipped and fell. He was involved in a mandatory exercise
          program. He claims that the court was negligently managed by the
          facility. The statute of limitations runs out. He tries to amend his
          complaint with a new allegation of counseling malpractice. The
          defendant objects, saying that this claim doesn�t relate back. The
          court decides that the original claim and new claim relate to the same
          facts, and so the motion to amend is granted.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let us take the two cases above together. Both people have negligence
          claims, a statute of limitations that has run, and they both want to
          amend their complaints. Aren�t they arguably both wrong? In the second
          case, the rehab center is sued for negligent maintenance of a
          basketball court. But then, the amended complaint says that they
          counseled the plaintiff negligently. In contrast, in the medical
          malpractice context, if you get sued as a result of a surgery and the
          claim is one for lack of informed consent, it�s lack of informed
          consent because something went wrong with the surgery. Wouldn�t that
          give some notice that what Dr. Baker allegedly did something bad in
          surgery? It doesn�t seem reasonable that the two allegations aren�t
          part of the same set of facts. You might argue that these should have
          been switched.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >What are the differences? Summary judgment was filed in the first
          case. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>How would that make a
          difference? It means that discovery has probably come to an end. The
          motion for summary judgment isn�t ripe until the close of discovery.
          That means this case is coming to an end, and probably an abrupt one.
          In this case, Dr. Baker is on the verge of victory. All of the sudden,
          he�s hit with a surprise of a new cause of action. In the other case,
          discovery may still be going on. So one reason the two cases are
          different is the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">surprise</i> element. Courts
          are more willing to let you relate amendments back if it�s not going
          to be to the detriment of the other side. Another suggestion has to do
          with the way the amendments were crafted. In </span

        ><span
          >, we start with the �no informed consent� claim and try to go to a
          broader claim: general negligence. But in the rehab case, we start
          with the general claim of negligence and then try to slice out a
          particular kind of claim. Thus, courts may favor amendments that move
          from the general to the specific. Two courts look at the same Federal
          Rule with the same language, but come out differently. So the Rule
          doesn�t have complete clarity on its face.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Notice that there is a portion of Rule 15(c<span class="GramE"
            >)(</span
          >3) that deals with changes in the party�s name. The amendment will
          relate back if you�re simply changing the name of the person you�re
          suing because you�ve sued the wrong person. This is what Zielinski
          did. If Rule 15(c) had been in operation at the time, this would have
          been the way to resolve the problem.</span

        <span
          >�All of the interesting things in procedure relate to joinder.� We�ll
          deal with complex joinder issues, but today we must look at the
          pedestrian issues of claim joinder. We simply look at a combination of
          the Federal Rules on the one hand and the issues of jurisdiction and
          preclusion on the other. Rule 18 tells us that a party asserting a
          claim can do so as a claim (regular old plaintiff suing a defendant),
          a counterclaim (if the defendant has a cause of action against the
          plaintiff too), a cross-claim (a suit between the defendants), or a
          third-party claim (like an insurance company or some other party
          brought in by the defendants). In contemporary litigation, we may see
          all of these at once!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How can claims be brought together? Let�s say a wrongfully discharged

        ><span
          >. Could that plaintiff do it under the rules? Rule 18 tells us that
          they can join as many claims as they want against the same person! So
          if you�re just looking at the Federal Rules, there�s no problem. But
          we have to also look at jurisdiction; in this case, we must look at
          supplemental jurisdiction. This requires us to add additional claims
          against other parties, if needed. This stems from the Article III
          description of cases and controversies as interpreted by the Supreme
          Court in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gibbs</i>. In
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gibbs</i>, we had the same
          situation: a state claim and a federal tort claim. Brennan says that
          they can both be brought if they arise from the same nucleus of
          operative fact. Would they be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">expected</i> to be litigated
          together in a single proceeding?
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>The claims we mentioned above
          seem to go together well. These claims could be joined properly under
          both the Rules and the statute.</span

          They are far removed from each other! Under the writ system, you bring
          all of your causes of action against a single person if you wanted,
          even if they were unrelated. This is permissible under the rule, but
          not under supplemental jurisdiction. The statute tells us that we can
          join other parties. This is what we used to call �pendant party
          jurisdiction�. So it�s okay! If you�re going to party that would bust
          diversity jurisdiction, that�s not okay. So joinder of claims is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">always</i> okay under Rule 18,
          but not necessarily under the other statutes and principles that
          govern us. Don�t worry about supplemental jurisdiction
          <span class="GramE">now,</span> we�ll come back to it later.</span

        <span
          >Claims are governed by Rule 18, but counterclaims are governed by
          Rule 13. There are two types: �compulsory counterclaims� and
          �permissive counterclaims�. If a claim arises out of the same
          transaction or occurrence, you must �use it or lose it�. In Rule
          13(b), we have
          <span class="GramE">permissive counterclaims, which means</span> you
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">may</i> bring them and raise
          claims that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">don�t</i> arise out

          >Blazer loaned some money to Plant. Plant sued based on
          truth-in-lending (failure to disclose). The defendants counterclaim
          for the unpaid balance of the loan. The plaintiff didn�t pay! Their
          counterclaim is that they�re still owed money on the loan even if they
          didn�t fully disclose. So is the counterclaim compulsory or not? One
          way to look at this is to flip the situation. If the bank had sued
          Plant on non-payment of the debt, would her truth-in-lending claim
          have been compulsory? It doesn�t seem like she would have lost her
          truth-in-lending claim if she hadn�t brought it up when she got sued
          for non-payment. You wouldn�t think that violating disclosure rules in
          a loan is part of the same transaction as non-payment.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court starts with the rule itself, which gives us the test. Does
          the counterclaim �arise out of the same transaction or occurrence�?
          There�s a laundry list of different tests that can be used. The court
          decides to use the �logical relationship� test. But not every circuit
          agrees that these two types of claims have to be brought together.
          Much like the Rule 15(c) amendment issue, we have the same
          transactional test that can be viewed by courts quite differently
          based on the test that they choose and the spin that they decide to
          put on the facts. If you were cynical, you might find that the Fifth
          Circuit is biased towards creditors and against debtors.</span

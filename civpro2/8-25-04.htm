          >We left off looking at the conflict between what one pleads in order
          to meet Rule 8 and what one must do in order to meet Rule 11. The
          Rules present inconsistent burdens: the lawyer must have,
          theoretically, the facts in order to prove that you�ve done a
          reasonable investigation before filing, but
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >you don�t have to plead those facts</i
          >
          per the notice pleading standard. Today, we continue, skipping the
          ethical part and looping back to the pleading part.</span

        <span
          >The drafters of the Rules envisioned a limited situation where more
          specific pleading would be required: pleadings involving
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">fraud</i> or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">mistake</i>. This is found in
          Rule 9(b): ��all averments of fraud or mistake�shall be pleaded with
          particularity.� In certain cases, the pleading must do more than
          notice by articulating some
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">factual</i> basis to develop
          the claim. This is pretty much a fraud rule because there isn�t a body
          of law in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">mistake</i>. So the
          drafters� ideal world would be notice pleading for everything except
          for fraud.</span

        <span
          >This isn�t even a published opinion. It�s rather unremarkable. How is
          this pleading requirement applied? What did Dr.
          <span class="SpellE">Stradford</span> do? He had insurance covering
          his office. He let his insurance payments lapse. The insurance company
          cancelled the policy for a certain period of time. Then he starts
          paying again, and the insurance company lets him restart coverage by
          saying that he had no claims during the period where he missed his
          payments. But very soon after the policy was reinstated, he filed a
          claim saying that frozen pipes caused damage in his office. The first
          claim was about $150,000, which was pretty big. The company paid the
          claim. But then he submitted a revised claim for $1.38 million!!!
          That�s a red flag to an insurance company if you ever saw one! The
          company starts investigating more thoroughly. They end up believing
          that the loss actually occurred during the time when the policy had
          lapsed. They don�t pay the big claim!</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The dentist sues for this claim, and the insurance company
          <span class="SpellE">countersues</span> for the $150,000, plus
          punitive damages and investigation expenses. Does it matter for the
          purposes of Rule 9 whether it�s a claim or counterclaim?
          <span class="GramE">Apparently not.</span> One of the issues around
          Rule 9 is what it applies to. All courts will apply the standard to
          claims and counterclaims. What about a subset of a claim that has a
          �fraud-like� element to it? The counterclaim is for common law fraud.
          But what if it were a state statutory claim for fraud? Would that make
          a difference to the pleading standard? There isn�t consensus on that
          point: some courts contend that this is limited to only common law
          fraud, but this is a minority view. Yeazell chose a common law case so
          we don�t have to get into the issue.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why do we have a different rule for pleading fraud than everything
          else? What does the court say? How do we interpret the �circumstances
          constituting the fraud�? What did the drafters mean? Is there sort of
          a �legislative history� of the Rule? Neither Congress nor the </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>ABA</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          have <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">any</i> commentary
          whatsoever on Rule 9! But we do get a comment with the Rule. We have a
          shoddy history! Fairman thinks that this rule is a historical
          accident. Fraud was <span class="GramE">plead</span> with
          particularity under the common law system. Even though we shifted to
          the notice pleading standard, there was some reason judges liked this
          standard. But the drafters don�t tell us why they liked it! We have to
          try to figure out why it was adopted!
          <span class="GramE"
            >Because it�s not ingrained in the history, the �whys� very
            dramatically.</span
          >
          This court uses the �time, place, nature� standard. But that�s not the
          only standard applied by the federal appellate courts as to
          fraud.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are Circuits that require you to �detail the statements�: you
          must provide the statements that were made that were allegedly
          fraudulent. You must identify the speaker. You must identify when and
          where the statements were made and you must explain why they were
          fraudulent. You need the �who�, �what�, �where�, �when� and �why�.
          That�s the mainstream argument, but it�s not the only one. This
          truncated version is used because there is no question of who. So
          let�s say we have the newspaper standard. Some standards require you
          to plead the elements of fraud, which is clearly wrong. The best
          practice is to always plead the elements, based on what your
          jurisdiction wants. There�s also a standard that says that you must
          give <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">fair notice</i> of fraud.
          That�s the better view, says Fairman, because you should read Rule 9
          in relation to Rule 8. Rule 9, it is argued, wasn�t meant to change
          the way pleading is done, but it�s just a slight �tweak� done to fraud
          cases. In some jurisdictions, the standard varies depending on the
          complexity of the case.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >None of these standards are found in the Rule! It�s hard to figure
          out what the proper approach to Rule 9 should be. It simply depends on
          your jurisdiction. But how does this all come together theoretically?
          We have reasons that are given as to why we want to have heightened
          pleading for fraud claims. The major rationales are to (1) protect
          settled transactions, (2) protect the defendant�s reputation, (3)
          deter frivolous suits, and (4) provide notice (�the right one�).</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >At common law, the equity courts were the only courts that recognized
          fraud as an affirmative defense. You couldn�t go to the law courts if
          someone sued you on the contract and defend it by saying that you were
          fraudulently induced into signing it. You would have to wait until
          there was a law judgment against you. Then you would go file a
          separate suit in the equity court to undo the judgment of the law
          court. Pleading with more particularity makes sense in the
          <span class="GramE">Middle</span> Ages, since you�re trying to
          overcome the judgment of another court. But the law courts, over time,
          begin to adopt all the basic affirmative defenses that the law courts
          used. When the two systems are eventually merged, you can still see a
          �glimmer� of why the rule is there: perhaps you�re trying to protect
          the transaction itself. But why is this extended from an affirmative
          defense to a claim for fraud?
          <span class="GramE">Doesn�t make sense to Fairman.</span> If someone
          has defrauded you, you typically want something back. Whatever
          rationale for having these suits in the equity courts is now gone.
          This requirement is extended to the Field Codes and remains as a
          legacy. This isn�t a justification you see very much. Courts don�t
          particularly understand it, for one thing.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How about protecting the defendant�s reputation? How would that work?
          Is Dr. <span class="SpellE">Stradford</span> on notice of what the
          insurance company means by the counterclaim? Well, sure! If the
          pleading had been judged by a Rule 8 standard, there�s no way it would
          have been dismissed. Would it affect your decision about going to a
          dentist if that dentist was sued for fraud? We don�t require
          heightened pleading for professional malpractice! That will probably
          hurt a dentist�s reputation even more than fraud. What about
          intentional torts or wrongful death claims? Those claims don�t have
          heightened pleading! Why do we single out fraud? If this is the
          justification, then this is an
          <span class="SpellE">underinclusive</span> rule. There are a lot of
          claims that are probably worse that, according to this logic, ought to
          have heightened pleading too.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s say you file a fraud claim and someone rushes in with a motion
          to dismiss. If you don�t require heightened pleading for fraud and you
          use a notice pleading standard (just as the rules intend), then these
          suits are easy to file. Then you do discovery and try to find the
          facts later. Because of this dynamic, there is at least some merit to
          the rationale of deterring frivolous �strike suits�. It�s argued that
          the claims are too easy to plead and too hard for defendants to get
          out of. <span class="SpellE">Fairman�s</span> problem with this is
          that he thinks there are no frivolous lawsuits. He thinks that�s a
          myth. How do you know a lawsuit is frivolous? The same lawsuit is
          never both tried and not tried in order to find out if it was really
          frivolous. Fairman claims that you can�t prove any particular lawsuit
          is frivolous. You can look at what kinds of cases are dismissed at
          particular stages, but that might be due to circular reasoning.</span

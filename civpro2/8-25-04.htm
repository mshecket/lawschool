<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>We
left off looking at the conflict between what one pleads in order to meet Rule
8 and what one must do in order to meet Rule 11.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Rules present inconsistent burdens: the
lawyer must have, theoretically, the facts in order to prove that you’ve done a
reasonable investigation before filing, but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you
don’t have to plead those facts</i> per the notice pleading standard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today, we continue, skipping the ethical part
and looping back to the pleading part.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Heightened pleading</span></b><span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
drafters of the Rules envisioned a limited situation where more specific
pleading would be required: pleadings involving <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>fraud</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mistake</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is found in Rule 9(b): “…all averments
of fraud or mistake…shall be pleaded with particularity.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In certain cases, the pleading must do more
than notice by articulating some <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>factual</i>
basis to develop the claim.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
pretty much a fraud rule because there isn’t a body of law in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mistake</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So the drafters’ ideal world would be notice pleading for everything
except for fraud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>This
isn’t even a published opinion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s
rather unremarkable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How is this
pleading requirement applied?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What did
Dr. <span class=SpellE>Stradford</span> do?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He had insurance covering his office.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He let his insurance payments lapse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The insurance company cancelled the policy for a certain period of
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then he starts paying again, and
the insurance company lets him restart coverage by saying that he had no claims
during the period where he missed his payments.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But very soon after the policy was reinstated, he filed a claim saying
that frozen pipes caused damage in his office.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The first claim was about $150,000, which was pretty big.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company paid the claim.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But then he submitted a revised claim for
$1.38 million!!!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a red flag to an
insurance company if you ever saw one!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The company starts investigating more thoroughly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They end up believing that the loss actually
occurred during the time when the policy had lapsed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t pay the big claim!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
dentist sues for this claim, and the insurance company <span class=SpellE>countersues</span>
for the $150,000, plus punitive damages and investigation expenses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does it matter for the purposes of Rule 9
whether it’s a claim or counterclaim?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>Apparently not.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One
of the issues around Rule 9 is what it applies to.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All courts will apply the standard to claims
and counterclaims.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about a subset
of a claim that has a “fraud-like” element to it?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The counterclaim is for common law
fraud.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what if it were a state statutory
claim for fraud?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would that make a
difference to the pleading standard?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
isn’t consensus on that point: some courts contend that this is limited to only
common law fraud, but this is a minority view.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Yeazell chose a common law case so we don’t have to get into the issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Why
do we have a different rule for pleading fraud than everything else?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does the court say?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do we interpret the “circumstances
constituting the fraud”?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What did the
drafters mean?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is there sort of a “legislative
history” of the Rule?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Neither Congress
nor the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>ABA</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
'> have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i>
commentary whatsoever on Rule 9!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we
do get a comment with the Rule.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have
a shoddy history!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fairman thinks that
this rule is a historical accident.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Fraud was <span class=GramE>plead</span> with particularity under the common
law system.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even though we shifted to
the notice pleading standard, there was some reason judges liked this
standard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the drafters don’t tell us
why they liked it!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have to try to
figure out why it was adopted!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>Because it’s not ingrained in the history, the “whys” very
dramatically.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This court uses the
“time, place, nature” standard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that’s
not the only standard applied by the federal appellate courts as to fraud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>There
are Circuits that require you to “detail the statements”: you must provide the
statements that were made that were allegedly fraudulent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You must identify the speaker.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You must identify when and where the
statements were made and you must explain why they were fraudulent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You need the “who”, “what”, “where”, “when”
and “why”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s the mainstream
argument, but it’s not the only one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This truncated version is used because there is no question of who.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So let’s say we have the newspaper
standard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some standards require you to
plead the elements of fraud, which is clearly wrong.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The best practice is to always plead the
elements, based on what your jurisdiction wants.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s also a standard that says that you
must give <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fair notice</i> of fraud.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s the better view, says Fairman, because
you should read Rule 9 in relation to Rule 8.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Rule 9, it is argued, wasn’t meant to change the way pleading is done,
but it’s just a slight “tweak” done to fraud cases.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In some jurisdictions, the standard varies
depending on the complexity of the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>None
of these standards are found in the Rule!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s hard to figure out what the proper approach to Rule 9 should be.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It simply depends on your jurisdiction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But how does this all come together theoretically?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have reasons that are given as to why we
want to have heightened pleading for fraud claims.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The major rationales are to (1) protect
settled transactions, (2) protect the defendant’s reputation, (3) deter frivolous
suits, and (4) provide notice (“the right one”).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>At common
law, the equity courts were the only courts that recognized fraud as an
affirmative defense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You couldn’t go to
the law courts if someone sued you on the contract and defend it by saying that
you were fraudulently induced into signing it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You would have to wait until there was a law judgment against you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then you would go file a separate suit in the
equity court to undo the judgment of the law court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Pleading with more particularity makes sense
in the <span class=GramE>Middle</span> Ages, since you’re trying to overcome
the judgment of another court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the
law courts, over time, begin to adopt all the basic affirmative defenses that
the law courts used.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the two
systems are eventually merged, you can still see a “glimmer” of why the rule is
there: perhaps you’re trying to protect the transaction itself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But why is this extended from an affirmative defense
to a claim for fraud?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Doesn’t
make sense to Fairman.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If someone
has defrauded you, you typically want something back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whatever rationale for having these suits in
the equity courts is now gone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
requirement is extended to the Field Codes and remains as a legacy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This isn’t a justification you see very
much.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Courts don’t particularly
understand it, for one thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>How
about protecting the defendant’s reputation?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How would that work?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Stradford</span> on notice of what the insurance company means by
the counterclaim?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, sure!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the pleading had been judged by a Rule 8
standard, there’s no way it would have been dismissed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would it affect your decision about going to
a dentist if that dentist was sued for fraud?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We don’t require heightened pleading for professional malpractice!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That will probably hurt a dentist’s
reputation even more than fraud.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
about intentional torts or wrongful death claims?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those claims don’t have heightened pleading!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why do we single out fraud?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If this is the justification, then this is an
<span class=SpellE>underinclusive</span> rule.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are a lot of claims that are probably worse that, according to
this logic, ought to have heightened pleading too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Let’s
say you file a fraud claim and someone rushes in with a motion to dismiss.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you don’t require heightened pleading for
fraud and you use a notice pleading standard (just as the rules intend), then
these suits are easy to file.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then you
do discovery and try to find the facts later.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Because of this dynamic, there is at least some merit to the rationale
of deterring frivolous “strike suits”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s argued that the claims are too easy to plead and too hard for defendants
to get out of.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Fairman’s</span>
problem with this is that he thinks there are no frivolous lawsuits.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He thinks that’s a myth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do you know a lawsuit is frivolous?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The same lawsuit is never both tried and not
tried in order to find out if it was really frivolous.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fairman claims that you can’t prove any particular
lawsuit is frivolous.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can look at
what kinds of cases are dismissed at particular stages, but that might be due
to circular reasoning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

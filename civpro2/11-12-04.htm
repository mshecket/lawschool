          The plaintiff is concerned about how long the case will take. She
          doesn�t want to wait a long time. She is also concerned about having
          her rights be redressed. We can craft a confidentiality agreement that
          will work.</span

          for sexual discrimination. They take a deposition of a Ms. Thomas. At
          the time of the case, there was a settlement and settlement agreement
          between Ms. Thomas and </span

          This case punctuates confidentiality agreements. If they come into
          conflict with other, broader principles, then even a duly bargained
          for confidentiality agreement might give way.</span

          come to resolution. When there is mediation, negotiation is assisted
          by a third party. There can be arbitration, which is unofficial
          adjudication. There can also be early neutral evaluation.</span

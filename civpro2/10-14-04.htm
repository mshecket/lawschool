<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>How
do we end class actions?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do lawyers
get paid?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the issue that has
created the most controversy behind class actions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is the perception that the lawyers get
lots of money but the class itself gets next to nothing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawyers could get an hourly rate or work on
contingency.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if the class is highly
nebulous, the named plaintiffs don’t want to bear this burden.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can’t enter a contingency agreement with
an unknown class.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So here we have the
common fund doctrine, which allows for the lawyers to be paid out of the pool
of money that they are able to acquire for the class itself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As they create a fund for the relief of the plaintiff
class, they get paid out of it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
arrangement has a contingency “flavor” to it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Typically, the common fund doctrine uses the lodestar: a calculation of how
many hours one would reasonably expect to spend on the litigation times a
reasonable hourly rate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Say
we have a solo practitioner working for a class of automobile consumers who
have been overcharged.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He spends three
years on the case and gets a $100,000 settlement on the behalf of the class.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He works 1500 billable hours over those three
years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a solo practitioner, he wouldn’t
have charged as much as an experienced attorney, but an experienced attorney
would have done it faster.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We will give
him $75 because that’s what he’s worth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How many hours will we credit him for?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It would have taken the experienced attorney less time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we had $75 times 1300 hours, we would have
to pay the lawyer just under $100,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The plaintiffs would only get $12.50 each!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s stupid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>What
if we have a 500 person class suing some defendant?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The defendant makes a settlement offer that
will give $95,000 to the lawyer and $5,000 to the class.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Should the court approve it?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does it just look at a bribe to the lawyer?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The class plaintiffs would probably
object.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Rules have been recently
amended to empower the court to do specific things in this situation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rule 23(h) is brand new and talks about attorneys’
fees in class actions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court may
award reasonable attorneys’ fees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
must be done by motion under Rule 54.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Notice of that motion must be served on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all parties</i> in a reasonable manner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The class must be told about the settlement!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then they have the chance to come and object.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court can hold a hearing if they want to.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the class counsel appointment stage at the
beginning of the class action, the court can request the different lawyers
competing to be class counsel to bid against one another.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But will this really happen?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could it be good for the class?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>What
are settlement class actions?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are
class actions where the complaint, answer, class certification and settlement
are filed simultaneously.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The parties
have already worked out all the details.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is like the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Amchem</i>
case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a framework that is a
target of criticism.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It “reeks of
collusion”!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both sides have already
agreed how to settle the suit, and the terms are usually highly favorable to
the lawyers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under the old Rule 23,
there were a series of “trash for the class” settlement class actions where the
lawyer would get a settlement offer that essentially bought off the lawyer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes the named plaintiff would get an “incentive
award” that comes out of the attorneys’ fee award.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do mass small wrongs get righted?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 2002 reforms make it a bit tougher to get
such a high level of inequity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But have
the new rules done much?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Almost no one
will opt out of class litigation because their stake is so small.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tradeoff is between trying to redress many
small grievances and giving a windfall to the attorneys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>This
is all about asbestos.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is lots of
procedure here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Amchem started out by
trying to find “global peace” for the asbestos companies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t get it, but that was their
plan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Asbestos lawsuits are filed all
over the place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lots of people have
cancer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Procedurally, the court uses a consolidation
device that allows you to move cases around in the federal courts for
efficiency reasons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of the litigation
goes to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
  12.0pt'>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style='font-size:

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All the lawsuits get consolidated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawyers want a global settlement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have “inventory plaintiffs”: people
currently dying.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those plaintiffs have
already filed their lawsuits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is
no question that there is control over those through the multi-district litigation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We also have a group of future plaintiffs who
haven’t filed a lawsuit yet because they haven’t been hurt yet, though they’ve
been exposed to asbestos.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’re hoping
to get both groups into a single lawsuit and settle it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>An
administrative plan was proposed that would pay exposure-only plaintiffs in a
similar way to workers’ compensation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Such a scheme would be cheaper for the asbestos companies than lawsuits.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is proposed as a settlement class action
with all of the terms included.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both plaintiff
classes and the attorneys will get paid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The District Court of Pennsylvania certifies the class as a (b)(3).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Third Circuit says it’s not fair.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court upholds the Third Circuit
and says you can’t do it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the
ethical situation here?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You couldn’t
agree not to represent future clients in return for settling a case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The ABA Rules forbid so-called “lock-out
agreements”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A lawyer can’t agree to
restrict his own right to practice law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What if they plan on settling all present and future cases?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This seems substantially similar, but it’s
not technically a lockout agreement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
global solution would be to bind everyone, which requires the use of
administrative settlement procedure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
questions of law and fact in common must predominate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district court found that the shared
experience in asbestos exposure and interest in receiving money is what predominated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ginsburg says Congress should create the
asbestos fund, not courts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Notice
that the current plaintiffs get money, and the exposure-only plaintiffs get an
administrative settlement procedure only (just the possibility of money).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here, the lawyers are representing two
different groups with different interests.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The inventory plaintiffs want money now, the exposure-only plaintiffs
want money later.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They could have
remedied this by having separate counsel to represent each of the different
groups.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that probably also would
have blown up the global settlement: the exposure-only lawyers never would have
agreed to such a scheme.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

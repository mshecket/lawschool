<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>A current affair</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
House passed, about 50 votes, a bill to change the Federal Rules.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’re trying to make John Edwards look
bad.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bill they passed is another
case of Congress ignoring the REA and the process of changing the Rules.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress wants to tinker with the rules
itself!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The supporters of the bill seem
to believe that federal judges will not sanction attorneys.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are trying to amend Rule 11 to make it a
requirement that a judge impose a sanction if the Rule is violated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A revision like this would never have made it
through the REA process.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next, they try
to impose Rule 11 on state cases if the case affects interstate commerce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They also try to federalize procedure as to
Rule 11.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>They
purport to limit the places a personal injury claim can be brought.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That would change <span class=GramE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> of our</span> personal jurisdiction as
to minimum contacts by establishing certain forums where certain types of
lawsuits can be brought.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For most
injuries, this will get the likely forums: where the plaintiff lives, where
they lived at the time of the injury, where the injury occurred, or the defendant’s
principal place of business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
consider a traffic accident.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under this statute,
you wouldn’t be able to sue the defendant where the defendant resides!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So as to individual defendants, you can’t sue
them where they live!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They also take
away from the plaintiff their choice of forum.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It gives us definitions of what constitutes these types of claims.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They also try to apply the bill to any claim
filed in federal or state court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Where
does Congress get the power to do this in the Constitution?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>This
illustrates the conflict related to just who will have the power to set the
rules in the courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Will the judges
make their own rules, or will Congress do it for them?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fairman doesn’t believe that there are lots
of frivolous lawsuits, and even if there are, he doesn’t think this will stop
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The motivation is that if we make
sanctions more available, we’ll keep lawyers from bringing “junk lawsuits”
because more federal judges will use Rule 11 sanctions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if this statute is passed, Fairman
guesses you’ll actually see less use of Rule 11 and more use of other
discretionary powers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Fairman
expects that nothing will happen in the Senate, or at least it will go slowly
enough that he can write a scathing critique!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Let’s
do some problems to help set the stage for these issues and how they play into
the supplemental jurisdiction statute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Say we have a single plaintiff who buys a car from a dealership.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He thinks it’s defective.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He sues both the dealership and the
manufacturer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s nothing fancy
about the lawsuit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a single cause
of action with one plaintiff and multiple defendants.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiff says: “One of these two defendants
or a combination of the two is liable.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s
say the dealer wants to file a claim of indemnity against the
manufacturer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe the manufacturer is
contractually obligated to indemnify the dealer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dealer can file a cross-claim!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rule 13(g) lets you do it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rule 14(a) would have worked if the
manufacturer hadn’t already been in the lawsuit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Impleader could bring them in as a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>third-party defendant</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>What
if the manufacturer wants to raise the claim that the defect was the dealer’s
fault and not their fault?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They just
file their Rule 8(b) answer, where you put your denials and defenses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s nothing else special that you have to
file.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You’re just denying your own liability.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if the manufacturer wants to assert a
claim for non-payment of other vehicles other than the one that’s allegedly a
lemon?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only way that the
manufacturer could make this as a cross-claim would be to use 13(g), but there’s
no transactional relationship!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They have
to file a separate lawsuit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can the
dealer <span class=SpellE>countersue</span> the plaintiff for not paying for
the car?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yes!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You don’t need the same transaction or
occurrence, depending on whether it’s a permissive or compulsory
counterclaim.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it’s a permissive
counterclaim, you can do it under 13(b), which doesn’t require anything except
that you have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> claim against the
opposing party.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it were a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>compulsory</i> counterclaim, then the dealer
would have to bring it or risk losing it under preclusion doctrine under Rule
13(a).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Why
wouldn’t Rule 18 help us?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It says that
you can join as many claims as you have against anybody you want!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Rules are a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>system</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even though this
Rule says that you can bring any cross-claim you want, you must read this Rule
as being limited by other Rules that add more specificity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The specific always trumps the general.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If this was the only Rule you were looking
at, you would screw up a lot!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have
to view the Rules as a system and be guided by the principles that are involved
in the construction of the Rules themselves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You want to bring claims and parties that seem to come out of the same
events together because it appears to be an efficient trial package.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only problem that messes this up is if
you have jurisdictional issues that make joinder cumbersome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lawsuit?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kroger was employed by a steel
company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were moving a crane, and

employer!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That would be a great option! <span

which owns the lines and sold them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then
<span class=GramE>there’s</span> the people who leased the crane, Owen.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everybody would think to sue the employer
first, but it’s precluded as a matter of substantive law by worker’s
compensation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was an on-the-job
injury, which is part of what state tort law does.<span

these events?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiff’s lawyer

make that decision?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They ultimately
bring a claim against Owen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe the

lawyers didn’t do their homework.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

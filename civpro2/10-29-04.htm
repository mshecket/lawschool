<p><b><span>Experts</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are two kinds of experts: testifying and consulting. You decide whether to have an expert testify
at trial depending on what he or she will say and whether he or she will be an
effective witness. The consulting
witnesses can only be discovered in exceptional circumstances. You can get anything you want out of the
testifying expert.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
do the Rules play out? Let’s say the plaintiffs
have two experts. They will both testify
at trial. What do we have to
disclose? We have to give up the names
of both experts and the expert report. We must freely give it up without any request under Rule 26(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>1). What about
their depositions? Can the defendant
depose these people? Let’s say the
second doctor isn’t going to testify and we have no intention of using his report
at trial. Is our disclosure burden
different? Now that he’s no longer a
testifying witness, we don’t have to disclose anything about him! That means you can get experts to figure out
a case without the fear of whatever they find out being disgorged as long as
you keep them from being a testifying expert.</span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Thompson v. <span
class=GramE>The Haskell Co.</span></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
plaintiff was fired by the defendant, and it was claimed that she suffered
depression as a result. The claim is
that the firing was due to sexual harassment. The plaintiff saw a doctor and that doctor made a report. The defendant wants a copy of the report. What role does Dr. Lucas play in this litigation? Is he a consulting witness or a testifying
witness? He is a consulting
witness. But you can get discovery from
consulting witnesses under exceptional circumstances. So are these exceptional circumstances? The defendant wants Dr. Lucas’s exam because
it was very timely. If her emotional
state is the result of having been fired, then you would think it would show up
in this report because she files her complaint way, way later. So the defendant’s lawyer wants to argue that
this report will have evidence related to being fired. If the report doesn’t mention being fired,
then she probably was depressed for some other reason. The court finds the report discoverable and
orders it produced.</span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Chiquita
International Ltd. v. M/V Bolero Reefer</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
happened? Chiquita wanted to ship their
bananas from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ecuador</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Germany</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. They hired Bolero Reefer to do the shipping,
and they lost some of the bananas. There
are two claims: one for the lost bananas that were left on the dock, and one
for the bananas that got all nasty in the boat. <span class=SpellE>Winer</span> is an expert marine surveyor. In the world of surveying bananas on boats,
he is apparently an expert! So Chiquita
sues Bolero for bad bananas. In the
context of this suit, we get <span class=SpellE>Winer’s</span> testimony. Bolero wanted access to that testimony in
order to look at the deposition. Is <span
class=SpellE>Winer</span> an expert witness at all, or just a fact
witness? The court decides that he is an
expert witness. There can be an expert
in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anything</i> as long as you can make
the case out right. But couldn’t they
have just looked at the boat themselves, or gotten their own expert witness?</span></p>

<p><b><span>The story of pleading</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Fairman’s
scholarship is chiefly in the area of pleading and pleading practice. What’s the relationship between common law
pleading practice and the modern Federal Rules? What does the King of England have anything to do with it? Let’s go back to Medieval Times! There were two types of courts: the royal
courts or king’s courts and the courts of equity. With the royal courts of justice, you had to
get the king’s attention somehow. What
develops initially as an oral tradition evolves into the system of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>writs</i>: paper documents that spelled out
different causes of action, such as the trespass writ. This was what Wright called “the elaborate
dance of pleading”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
you were served with a common law writ, do you demurrer or do you plea? The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>demurrer
</i>challenged the sufficiency of the writ: “So what? I assume that everything you’ve said is true,
but it doesn’t matter.” The pleas agreed
that the writ was sufficient but raised other objections. Dilatory pleas dealt with either jurisdiction
or venue: “Not here, not now.” The bars
either said: “Not true” or “yes, but”…these were <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>traverse </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>confession</i>. There was a formulaic way to get into court
and a formulaic way to respond. Today, a
12(b)(6) motion is quite similar to the common law demurrer. For jurisdiction and venue, we have 12(b)(1)
and 12(b)(5). For traverse and
confession, we have denials and affirmative defenses. So this is why it’s worth being familiar with
common law pleading practice: its elements are still present in the Federal
Rules today.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
something that Yeazell doesn’t mention: there was a whole parallel court system
to the royal courts, namely, the equity courts or courts of chancery. The courts of equity didn’t follow the same
rules of pleading as the common law courts and you could appeal upon the
chancery courts for relief because it was right and fair. They issued injunctions. There was no power at law for the equity
courts to order this. They could order specific
performance as a remedy. They also had
no jury trials. You wouldn’t need a jury
to decide issues of equity. The equity
courts develop their own way of doing things.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
we have a complicated, crappy system! By
the mid-nineteenth century, we get a reform effort in the form of the Field
Codes, or Code Pleading. It starts in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and spreads throughout the
country. Instead of having to use writs
and pleas, we’ll start litigation by presenting a statement of facts stating a cause
of action, written in a way that an ordinary person can understand. But here was the problem: it was overlaying a
reform on top of a body of lawyers who were used to using the old system. They found a way to make a game out of the
intended reform. What is a fact? What is a cause of action? Huge bodies of action developed over what a
fact is. Neither evidence nor
conclusions were considered facts, and you could get booted out for pleading
either. You also had to plead all the
elements of a cause of action, which led to other levels of complexity. The reform effort goes off the rails! Why did it happen? Both Field and common law pleadings tried to
make pleadings do lots of stuff in the legal process. Pleadings are good for giving you notice of
an upcoming lawsuit. They can also state
the facts, narrow issues, and resolve meritless claims.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
sets the stage for the next level of reform. Charles Clark was a federal appellate judge and professor at Yale. This was the “New Deal” for the federal courts! Clark and his draft committee had a vision of
what he wanted the rules to do. He
believed that both code pleading and common law pleading inappropriately kept
people from getting their day in court. A system of rules was developed around that premise. It all starts with Rule 1: there will be no
more split between law and equity courts. Federal courts will be able to give relief at law and in equity. Rule 2: there will only be one form of
action. Then we go to the famous Rule 8,
upon which Fairman’s career is based! This is our “short and plain statement” rule! It sets the bar relatively low. The facts are gone, the writs are gone, the cause
of action is gone. You just need the
short and plain statement. It’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>notice pleading!</i></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Look
at Form 9 under the Federal Rules…a guy gets hit by a car on a certain
date. The car was driven negligently. The plaintiff has his leg broken and had some
expenses. The plaintiff demands
payment! That’s notice. We don’t know <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>why</i> the defendant was negligent. Maybe the defendant sped! Maybe
he drove recklessly! Maybe he ran a stop
light! We assume that there was only one
accident on June 1<sup>st</sup>. The guy
won’t have to puzzle over why he was sued. The Rules tell us that these forms are sufficient. Wright says: “Rule 8 is the keystone!” All the other old burdens of pleading will be
provided by other rules and other steps in the process. Facts will be discovered in discovery, and
that’s also where we’ll narrow the issues. We can resolve meritless claims with motions to dismiss and summary
judgment. Pleading is made simple: we
perform other procedural tasks with other techniques.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
isn’t to say that there aren’t elements of code pleading still around. There are states that still have state
pleading rules based on code pleading. The California Code of Procedure requires a statement of facts, just
like the Field Code did. On the other
hand, even though the rule is there, that’s not really what they want. The influence of the Federal Rules has been
so great that the recitation of the facts required in the past is not
necessary. You can use a standard “check-the-box”
form. This is a far cry from what Field
intended! How does all of this work?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Haddle v.
Garrison</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We’re
taken through this litigation to try to explain the way pleading has developed
in the modern era. It’s a whistle-blower
case. Haddle testifies against his
former employers at Healthmaster who were involved in Medicare fraud. Haddle gets fired! That doesn’t seem right! So he sues in the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
  >Federal District Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> in the Southern District of
Georgia. We need personal jurisdiction
and subject matter jurisdiction. Personal
jurisdiction is easy because it’s a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> court with personal
jurisdiction over Haddle because he’s suing there. We have defendants from multiple places. We have some from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. Garrison is a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >South Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> resident. How does the court have personal jurisdiction
over him? Minimum contacts! <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="../civpro/internationalshoecovwashington.html">Shoe</a>!</i> What about subject matter jurisdiction? Why are we in federal rather than state
court? We don’t have complete
diversity. It’s based on the federal
civil rights statute – a federal claim! It’s a suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2). This anchors the case in federal court, and the state law claims are
hooked in with supplemental jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
do the Healthmaster defendants do? They
file a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss! They
claim that he suffered no constitutionally-protected injury. They say “so what”! The guy was hired, he cooperated with an
investigation, then he was fired. The
pleading basically says: “Yeah, we did it. So what?” At the time, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> was an at-will employment
state, meaning that you had no property interest in your job. Without a property interest at stake, there
was nothing wrong with firing him. The district
court buys the argument and grants the 12(b)(6) motion. It’s a winner because the Eleventh Circuit
says so in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morast v. Lance</i>. Haddle appeals to the Eleventh Circuit
itself, which per curiams him! In the Supreme
Court, the Eleventh Circuit gets overruled: he does have a claim! The claim gets reinstated and goes all the
way back down to the trial court!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So this
is how modern pleading has developed. The notice element is there, but there’s a whole lot more to the story
in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Haddle</i> complaint than the
drafters of the Rules might have anticipated. We also see the overlay of the review of law where the courts agree, but
then disagree as to whether the legal issue was right. Haddle wins, kind of. He doesn’t win much money. But the attorneys win big time! They get over $250,000 in legal fees from a
Magistrate Judge. We will continue to
think about this: the Rules create costs and benefits. Part of the negative impression of lawyers in
the public mind, according to Fairman, is due to stories like this where the
lawyers get a lot more money than the client. Is this inequitable? The jury can
certainly limit damages. The Magistrate
Judge didn’t grant all the fees that were asked for. They were basically cut in half.</span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The story of pleading</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Fairman’s
scholarship is chiefly in the area of pleading and pleading practice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the relationship between common law
pleading practice and the modern Federal Rules?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What does the King of England have anything to do with it?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s go back to Medieval Times!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were two types of courts: the royal
courts or king’s courts and the courts of equity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With the royal courts of justice, you had to
get the king’s attention somehow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
develops initially as an oral tradition evolves into the system of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>writs</i>: paper documents that spelled out
different causes of action, such as the trespass writ.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was what Wright called “the elaborate
dance of pleading”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>When
you were served with a common law writ, do you demurrer or do you plea?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>demurrer
</i>challenged the sufficiency of the writ: “So what?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I assume that everything you’ve said is true,
but it doesn’t matter.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The pleas agreed
that the writ was sufficient but raised other objections.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dilatory pleas dealt with either jurisdiction
or venue: “Not here, not now.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bars
either said: “Not true” or “yes, but”…these were <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>traverse </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>confession</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a formulaic way to get into court
and a formulaic way to respond.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today, a
12(b)(6) motion is quite similar to the common law demurrer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For jurisdiction and venue, we have 12(b)(1)
and 12(b)(5).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For traverse and
confession, we have denials and affirmative defenses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So this is why it’s worth being familiar with
common law pleading practice: its elements are still present in the Federal
Rules today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Here’s
something that Yeazell doesn’t mention: there was a whole parallel court system
to the royal courts, namely, the equity courts or courts of chancery.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The courts of equity didn’t follow the same
rules of pleading as the common law courts and you could appeal upon the
chancery courts for relief because it was right and fair.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They issued injunctions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no power at law for the equity
courts to order this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They could order specific
performance as a remedy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They also had
no jury trials.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You wouldn’t need a jury
to decide issues of equity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The equity
courts develop their own way of doing things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>So
we have a complicated, crappy system!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By
the mid-nineteenth century, we get a reform effort in the form of the Field
Codes, or Code Pleading.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It starts in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> and spreads throughout the
country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead of having to use writs
and pleas, we’ll start litigation by presenting a statement of facts stating a cause
of action, written in a way that an ordinary person can understand.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But here was the problem: it was overlaying a
reform on top of a body of lawyers who were used to using the old system.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They found a way to make a game out of the
intended reform.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is a fact?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is a cause of action?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Huge bodies of action developed over what a
fact is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Neither evidence nor
conclusions were considered facts, and you could get booted out for pleading
either.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You also had to plead all the
elements of a cause of action, which led to other levels of complexity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The reform effort goes off the rails!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why did it happen?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both Field and common law pleadings tried to
make pleadings do lots of stuff in the legal process.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Pleadings are good for giving you notice of
an upcoming lawsuit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They can also state
the facts, narrow issues, and resolve meritless claims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>This
sets the stage for the next level of reform.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Charles Clark was a federal appellate judge and professor at Yale.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was the “New Deal” for the federal courts!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Clark and his draft committee had a vision of
what he wanted the rules to do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
believed that both code pleading and common law pleading inappropriately kept
people from getting their day in court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A system of rules was developed around that premise.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It all starts with Rule 1: there will be no
more split between law and equity courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Federal courts will be able to give relief at law and in equity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rule 2: there will only be one form of
action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then we go to the famous Rule 8,
upon which Fairman’s career is based!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is our “short and plain statement” rule!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It sets the bar relatively low.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The facts are gone, the writs are gone, the cause
of action is gone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You just need the
short and plain statement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>notice pleading!</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Look
at Form 9 under the Federal Rules…a guy gets hit by a car on a certain
date.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The car was driven negligently.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiff has his leg broken and had some
expenses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiff demands
payment!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s notice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don’t know <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>why</i> the defendant was negligent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Maybe the defendant sped!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe
he drove recklessly!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe he ran a stop
light!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We assume that there was only one
accident on June 1<sup>st</sup>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The guy
won’t have to puzzle over why he was sued.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Rules tell us that these forms are sufficient.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Wright says: “Rule 8 is the keystone!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All the other old burdens of pleading will be
provided by other rules and other steps in the process.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Facts will be discovered in discovery, and
that’s also where we’ll narrow the issues.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We can resolve meritless claims with motions to dismiss and summary
judgment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Pleading is made simple: we
perform other procedural tasks with other techniques.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>This
isn’t to say that there aren’t elements of code pleading still around.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are states that still have state
pleading rules based on code pleading.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The California Code of Procedure requires a statement of facts, just
like the Field Code did.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other
hand, even though the rule is there, that’s not really what they want.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The influence of the Federal Rules has been
so great that the recitation of the facts required in the past is not
necessary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can use a standard “check-the-box”
form.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a far cry from what Field
intended!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How does all of this work?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>We’re
taken through this litigation to try to explain the way pleading has developed
in the modern era.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a whistle-blower
case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Haddle testifies against his
former employers at Healthmaster who were involved in Medicare fraud.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Haddle gets fired!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That doesn’t seem right!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So he sues in the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Federal District Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> in the Southern District of
Georgia.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We need personal jurisdiction
and subject matter jurisdiction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Personal
jurisdiction is easy because it’s a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> court with personal
jurisdiction over Haddle because he’s suing there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have defendants from multiple places.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have some from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>.<span

  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>South Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> resident.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How does the court have personal jurisdiction
over him?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Minimum contacts!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="../civpro/internationalshoecovwashington.html">Shoe</a>!</i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about subject matter jurisdiction?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why are we in federal rather than state
court?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don’t have complete
diversity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s based on the federal
civil rights statute – a federal claim!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s a suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This anchors the case in federal court, and the state law claims are
hooked in with supplemental jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>What
do the Healthmaster defendants do?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
file a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
claim that he suffered no constitutionally-protected injury.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They say “so what”!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The guy was hired, he cooperated with an
investigation, then he was fired.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
pleading basically says: “Yeah, we did it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So what?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the time, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> was an at-will employment
state, meaning that you had no property interest in your job.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Without a property interest at stake, there
was nothing wrong with firing him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district
court buys the argument and grants the 12(b)(6) motion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a winner because the Eleventh Circuit
says so in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morast v. Lance</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Haddle appeals to the Eleventh Circuit
itself, which per curiams him!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the Supreme
Court, the Eleventh Circuit gets overruled: he does have a claim!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The claim gets reinstated and goes all the
way back down to the trial court!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>So this
is how modern pleading has developed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The notice element is there, but there’s a whole lot more to the story
in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Haddle</i> complaint than the
drafters of the Rules might have anticipated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We also see the overlay of the review of law where the courts agree, but
then disagree as to whether the legal issue was right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Haddle wins, kind of.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He doesn’t win much money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the attorneys win big time!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They get over $250,000 in legal fees from a
Magistrate Judge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We will continue to
think about this: the Rules create costs and benefits.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Part of the negative impression of lawyers in
the public mind, according to Fairman, is due to stories like this where the
lawyers get a lot more money than the client.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Is this inequitable?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The jury can
certainly limit damages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Magistrate
Judge didn’t grant all the fees that were asked for.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were basically cut in half.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

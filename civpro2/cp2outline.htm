<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Why are the Federal Rules of

states’ rules have modeled their rules after the Federal Rules. Remember </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Erie</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> and the Rules Enabling Act. The Supreme Court has delegated its
responsibility to write the Federal Rules. There is the Judicial Conference, which has two parts: the Standing
Committee and the Advisory Committee. Congress has the opportunity to accept or reject Rule changes. For example, should you be able to file
things by fax? Lawyers say yes! It’s now in Rule 5(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>2)(D). You can deliver copies of things by fax as
long as you meet the standards of the local jurisdiction.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Congress can intervene
unilaterally by creating their <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>own</i>
rules, separate from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Fairman thinks this is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>One of the common criticisms
is that we live in an overly litigious society. Yeazell challenges the idea that there is an explosion of
litigation. Public perceptions cause
Congress to make changes in federal practice. Tort reform and class action reform stem from that. 98% of litigation is at the state level. Very little is federal. But the state rules are still modeled on the
Federal Rules. We don’t even have an
Ohio Rules course! <span class=GramE>So
only 3% of litigation goes to trial.</span> Most litigation settles. Everything we talk about up to pleading, joinder, and disposition prior
to trial is pretty much where litigation is. Very, very little gets to the trial stage. There are more jury trials than bench
trials. Contracts plaintiffs and torts
defendants tend to win. So Fairman and
others think that tort reform is bad.</span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Fairman’s</span></span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> scholarship is chiefly in the area of pleading and
pleading practice. What’s the
relationship between common law pleading practice and the modern Federal
Rules? What does the King of England
have anything to do with it? Let’s go
back to Medieval Times! There were two
types of courts: the royal courts or king’s courts and the courts of equity. With the royal courts of justice, you had to
get the king’s attention somehow. What
develops initially as an oral tradition evolves into the system of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>writs</i>: paper documents that spelled out
different causes of action, such as the trespass writ. This was what Wright called “the elaborate
dance of pleading”.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>When you were served with a
common law writ, do you demurrer or do you plea? The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>demurrer
</i>challenged the sufficiency of the writ: “So what? I assume that everything you’ve said is true,
but it doesn’t matter.” The pleas agreed
that the writ was sufficient but raised other objections. Dilatory pleas dealt with either jurisdiction
or venue: “Not here, not now.” The bars
either said: “Not true” or “yes, but”…these were <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>traverse </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>confession</i>. There was a formulaic way to get into court
and a formulaic way to respond. Today, a
12(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>6) motion is quite similar to the common law
demurrer. For jurisdiction and venue, we
have 12(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>1) and 12(b)(5). For traverse and confession, we have denials
and affirmative defenses. So this is why
it’s worth being familiar with common law pleading practice: its elements are
still present in the Federal Rules today.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Here’s something that Yeazell
doesn’t mention: there was a whole parallel court system to the royal courts,
namely, the equity courts or courts of chancery. The courts of equity didn’t follow the same
rules of pleading as the common law courts and you could appeal upon the
chancery courts for relief because it was right and fair. They issued injunctions. There was no power at law for the equity
courts to order this. They could order
specific performance as a remedy. They
also had no jury trials. You wouldn’t
need a jury to decide issues of equity. The equity courts develop their own way of doing things.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>So we have a complicated,
crappy system! By the mid-nineteenth
century, we get a reform effort in the form of the Field Codes, or Code
Pleading. It starts in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> and spreads throughout the country. Instead of having to use writs and pleas,
we’ll start litigation by presenting a statement of facts stating a cause of
action, written in a way that an ordinary person can understand. But here was the problem: it was overlaying a
reform on top of a body of lawyers who were used to using the old system. They found a way to make a game out of the
intended reform. What is a fact? What is a cause of action? Huge bodies of action developed over what a
fact is. Neither evidence nor
conclusions were considered facts, and you could get booted out for pleading
either. You also had to plead all the
elements of a cause of action, which led to other levels of complexity. The reform effort goes off the rails! Why did it happen? Both Field and common law pleadings tried to
make pleadings do lots of stuff in the legal process. Pleadings are good for giving you notice of
an upcoming lawsuit. They can also state
the facts, narrow issues, and resolve <span class=SpellE>meritless</span>
claims.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This sets the stage for the
next level of reform. Charles Clark was
a federal appellate judge and professor at Yale. This was the “New Deal” for the federal
courts! Clark and his draft committee
had a vision of what he wanted the rules to do. He believed that both code pleading and common law pleading
inappropriately kept people from getting their day in court. A system of rules was developed around that
premise. It all starts with Rule 1:
there will be no more split between law and equity courts. Federal courts will be able to give relief at
law and in equity. Rule 2: there will
only be one form of action. Then we go
to the famous Rule 8, upon which <span class=SpellE>Fairman’s</span> career is
based! This is our “short and plain
statement” rule! It sets the bar
relatively low. The facts are gone, the
writs are gone, <span class=GramE>the</span> cause of action is gone. You just need the short and plain
statement. It’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>notice pleading!</i></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Look at Form 9 under the
Federal Rules…a guy gets hit by a car on a certain date. The car was driven negligently. The plaintiff has his leg broken and had some
expenses. The plaintiff demands
payment! That’s notice. We don’t know <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>why</i> the defendant was negligent. Maybe the defendant sped! Maybe
he drove recklessly! Maybe he ran a stop
light! We assume that there was only one
accident on June 1<sup>st</sup>. The guy
won’t have to puzzle over why he was sued. The Rules tell us that these forms are sufficient. Wright says: “Rule 8 is the keystone!” All the other old burdens of pleading will be
provided by other rules and other steps in the process. Facts will be discovered in discovery, and
that’s also where we’ll narrow the issues. We can resolve <span class=SpellE>meritless</span> claims with motions
to dismiss and summary judgment. Pleading is made simple: we perform other procedural tasks with other
techniques.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This isn’t to say that there
aren’t elements of code pleading still around. There are states that still have state pleading rules based on code
pleading. The California Code of
Procedure requires a statement of facts, just like the Field Code did. On the other hand, even though the rule is
there, that’s not really what they want. The influence of the Federal Rules has been so great that the recitation
of the facts required in the past is not necessary. You can use a standard “check-the-box”
form. This is a far cry from what Field
intended! How does all of this work?</span></p>

does the court have personal jurisdiction over him? Minimum contacts! <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a

court? We don’t have complete
diversity. It’s based on the federal
civil rights statute – a federal claim! It’s a suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2). This anchors the case in federal court, and the state law claims are
hooked in with supplemental jurisdiction.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What do the <span

constitutionally-protected injury. They
say “so what”! <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The guy was hired, he
cooperated with an investigation, <span class=GramE>then</span> he was

no property interest in your job. Without a property interest at stake, there was nothing wrong with
firing him. The district court buys the
argument and grants the 12(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>6) motion. It’s a winner because the Eleventh Circuit
says so in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morast</i></span><i

court!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>So this is how modern
pleading has developed. The notice
element is there, but there’s a whole lot more to the story in the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Haddle</i></span> complaint
than the drafters of the Rules might have anticipated. We also see the overlay of the review of law
where the courts agree, but then disagree as to whether the legal issue was
right. <span class=SpellE>Haddle</span>
wins, kind of. He doesn’t win much
money. But the attorneys win big
time! They get over $250,000 in legal
fees from a Magistrate Judge. We will
continue to think about this: the Rules create costs and benefits. Part of the negative impression of lawyers in
the public mind, according to Fairman, is due to stories like this where the
lawyers get a lot more money than the client. Is this inequitable? The jury can
certainly limit damages. The Magistrate
Judge didn’t grant all the fees that were asked for. They were basically cut in half.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We left off with the short
story of pleading. The bottom line is
that Rule 8 is “notice pleading”. Notice
should be sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. It’s possible to have a statement that’s too
long. A complaint could be so detailed
that a court could dismiss it on the basis of prolixity. A 4,000 page complaint is too damn much! Notice that you can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>plead inconsistently</i>. It’s
provided for in Rule 8(e<span class=GramE>)(</span>2). You can set forth alternate or hypothetical
statements of claims or defenses regardless of consistency. This may make us uneasy that we can plead
things that are internally inconsistent. But </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Clark</span></st1:place><span

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Yesterday, we looked at the
plight of <span class=SpellE>Haddle</span>. <span class=SpellE>Haddle</span> lost in the trial court because the law
of the circuit said that he had no property interest in his continued
employment. What if the law said that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>had</i> a property interest if the company
had promised it would only terminate him for cause? In other words, he’s still in an at-will
state, but the company has promised only to fire him for cause. Could <span class=SpellE>Haddle</span> amend
his pleading to avoid 12(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>6)? Shouldn’t he have thought of that the first
time around? Why can’t he make that
point going forward, though? But we
don’t know whether the company promised him he would only be dismissed for
cause. You can’t just lie to get past

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Rule 11 is a long rule. Every <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>piece
of paper </i>filed in a court shall be signed by at least one attorney or pro
se party. Stuff that’s filed has to be
signed! The reason it’s important comes
in 11(b): you assert that you’ve done a reasonable investigation and you, in
good faith, think you’re properly filing the document. You can’t harass or delay! You have to have non-frivolous claims! You have to have facts that can be supported
by evidence! There is a tension in the
Rules: plead quickly and get the lawsuit started, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>but</i> Rule 11 says that you must have done reasonable investigation
first. What are the consequences? The court can impose sanctions! Attorneys, firms, or parties can be
sanctioned. Rule 11(c) sets out a
detailed process for how we do this.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>You can mostly just read Rule
11 and you’ll get it. If it <span
class=SpellE>ain’t</span> filed with the court, it <span class=SpellE>ain’t</span>
a Rule 11 violation! If there’s no
document, or it’s not filed, or there’s no court…no violation. What about groundless discovery? Rule 11 doesn’t apply to discovery! There’s a different part of the Rules that
deal with discovery abuses: Rule 26. The
penalty scheme there is different. What
about a client who brings in a frivolous lawsuit and you rush to file it? The attorney can get knocked for Rule 11(b<span
class=GramE>)(</span>3). It looks like
there was no investigation! You need an
“inquiry reasonable under the circumstances”. That means you might be off the hook if the client comes to you when the
statute of limitations is almost over. If you only have a day to file the lawsuit, they might go easier on you.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'> – This is a case of lawyers failing to investigate

  style='font-size:11.0pt'>South Dakota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> defendant will violate the rule of complete
diversity. This is an interpretation of
28 U.S.C. § 1332. On the face of the
complaint, there’s no federal jurisdiction. Norwest sent the plaintiff’s lawyer notice of this. They try to be nice about it. Massey ignores them, basically. Norwest files a motion to dismiss and a motion
for Rule 11 sanctions.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Why does Massey argue that
Rule 11 sanctions are inappropriate here? He says it would be too hard to figure out where the defendants are
from! Tough, dude! Plaintiffs have managed to do this basically
forever. So the argument is stupid on
its face. It’s not surprising the
sanctions were affirmed given that that’s the extent of his argument.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Pay attention to what Norwest
does. They’re represented by
sophisticated litigation counsel. Do
they follow appropriate procedure? Rule
11(c<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)(A) tells us that we initiate sanctions by
motion after we first give the other party 21 days to withdraw their
motion. Norwest sent the guy a
letter. They didn’t really <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>serve</i> him. Norwest appears to have messed up! To do this right, they should have drafted
its motion for Rule 11 sanctions, served it on Massey, waited 21 days, see if
he dismissed the lawsuit, and only <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>then</i>
file the motion with the court. This is
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>safe harbor</i> provision. It tries to let lawyers work these issues out
without taking up the court’s time. So
how do we get an affirmation of the sanctions? Luckily, there’s another bit, Rule 11(c<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)(B),
which lets the court impose sanctions <span class=SpellE>sua</span> <span
class=SpellE>sponte</span>. Did the
district court issue a show cause order? We don’t know. Law firms can have
their own Rule 11 procedure. You would

found that the suit was absolutely <span class=SpellE>meritless</span>. The plaintiff’s attorney, Hicks, did lots and
lots of stuff wrong. Why would Mattel
have pursued the strategy it pursued? It
files its motion for summary judgment first and then files for Rule 11
sanctions as opposed to filing for Rule 11 sanctions first and getting the
lawsuit dismissed. This massively runs
up the bill, where you could have had the same result much faster and cheaper. But Mattel wants to send a message: don’t
screw with us. They <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

vigorously litigates slip-and-fall cases. The district court’s Rule 11 orders are vacated! The district court, in all its excitement,
imposed sanctions for stuff that you can’t impose sanctions on under Rule
11. You can only be sanctioned for the
filing of improper papers! The district
court goes beyond that in its justification. <span class=GramE>Hicks gets</span> a short term victory in the Court of
Appeals, but he’ll get hammered when it goes back to the district court. It’s a victory, in the long haul, for

his insurance payments lapse. The
insurance company cancelled the policy for a certain period of time. Then he starts paying again, and the

during the period where he missed his payments. But very soon after the policy was reinstated, he filed a claim saying
that frozen pipes caused damage in his office. The first claim was about $150,000, which was pretty big. The company paid the claim. But then he submitted a revised claim for
$1.38 million!!! That’s a red flag to an
insurance company if you ever saw one! The company starts investigating more thoroughly. They end up believing that the loss actually

of the issues around Rule 9 is what it applies to. All courts will apply the standard to claims

fraud. But what if it were a state
statutory claim for fraud? Would that

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are Circuits that
require you to “detail the statements”: you must provide the statements that
were made that were allegedly fraudulent. You must identify the speaker. You must identify when and where the statements were made and you must
explain why they were fraudulent. You
need the “who”, “what”, “where”, “when” and “why”. That’s the mainstream argument, but it’s not
the only one. This truncated version is
used because there is no question of who. So let’s say we have the newspaper standard. Some standards require you to plead the
elements of fraud, which is clearly wrong. The best practice is to always plead the elements, based on what your
jurisdiction wants. There’s also a
standard that says that you must give <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fair
notice</i> of fraud. That’s the better
view, says Fairman, because you should read Rule 9 in relation to Rule 8. Rule 9, it is argued, wasn’t meant to change
the way pleading is done, but it’s just a slight “tweak” done to fraud cases. In some jurisdictions, the standard varies
depending on the complexity of the case.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>None of these standards are
found in the Rule! It’s hard to figure
out what the proper approach to Rule 9 should be. It simply depends on your jurisdiction. But how does this all come together
theoretically? We have reasons that are
given as to why we want to have heightened pleading for fraud claims. The major rationales are to (1) protect
settled transactions, (2) protect the defendant’s reputation, (3) deter
frivolous suits, and (4) provide notice (“the right one”).</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>At common law, the equity
courts were the only courts that recognized fraud as an affirmative
defense. You couldn’t go to the law
courts if someone sued you on the contract and defend it by saying that you
were fraudulently induced into signing it. You would have to wait until there was a law judgment against you. Then you would go file a separate suit in the
equity court to undo the judgment of the law court. Pleading with more particularity makes sense
in the <span class=GramE>Middle</span> Ages, since you’re trying to overcome
the judgment of another court. But the
law courts, over time, begin to adopt all the basic affirmative defenses that
the law courts used. When the two
systems are eventually merged, you can still see a “glimmer” of why the rule is
there: perhaps you’re trying to protect the transaction itself. But why is this extended from an affirmative
defense to a claim for fraud? <span
class=GramE>Doesn’t make sense to Fairman.</span> If someone has defrauded you, you typically
want something back. Whatever rationale
for having these suits in the equity courts is now gone. This requirement is extended to the Field
Codes and remains as a legacy. This
isn’t a justification you see very much. Courts don’t particularly understand it, for one thing.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>How about protecting the
defendant’s reputation? How would that
work? Is Dr. <span class=SpellE>Stradford</span>
on notice of what the insurance company means by the counterclaim? Well, sure! If the pleading had been judged by a Rule 8 standard, there’s no way it
would have been dismissed. Would it
affect your decision about going to a dentist if that dentist was sued for
fraud? We don’t require heightened
pleading for professional malpractice! That will probably hurt a dentist’s reputation even more than
fraud. What about intentional torts or
wrongful death claims? Those claims
don’t have heightened pleading! Why do
we single out fraud? If this is the
justification, then this is an <span class=SpellE>underinclusive</span>
rule. There are a lot of claims that are
probably worse that, according to this logic, ought to have heightened pleading
too.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Let’s say you file a fraud
claim and someone rushes in with a motion to dismiss. If you don’t require heightened pleading for
fraud and you use a notice pleading standard (just as the rules intend), then
these suits are easy to file. Then you
do discovery and try to find the facts later. Because of this dynamic, there is at least some merit to the rationale
of deterring frivolous “strike suits”. It’s argued that the claims are too easy to plead and too hard for
defendants to get out of. <span
class=SpellE>Fairman’s</span> problem with this is that he thinks there are no
frivolous lawsuits. He thinks that’s a
myth. How do you know a lawsuit is
frivolous? The same lawsuit is never
both tried and not tried in order to find out if it was really frivolous. Fairman claims that you can’t prove any
particular lawsuit is frivolous. You can
look at what kinds of cases are dismissed at particular stages, but that might
be due to circular reasoning.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We hope to get to, and
through, the pleading burden issues in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gomez</i>
case, which also ties into heightened pleading. It appears that notice pleading applies for everything except for a
certain small subset. Recall that courts
have required particularity in pleading for fraud allegations in a variety of
ways. Fairman thinks that Rule 9(b)
doesn’t make much sense! We wrapped up
by asking whether Rule 9(b) is justified by deterrence of frivolous strike
suits. Fairman says that only <span
class=GramE>a small subset of all frivolous claims are</span> fraud claims or
fraud-like.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What’s docket control? It has to do with giving judges the power to
dismiss lawsuits based on their belief that certain cases are more likely to be
frivolous. But Fairman fears that this
will cause suits that are truly meritorious to be dismissed at an early
stage. He says it goes against the
preference built into the Federal Rules for trying cases on the merits.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The only rationale for
heightened pleading for fraud is “heightened notice”. What did I, the alleged fraudster, say that
misrepresented a material fact? I need
to know the specific statement so I know the specific allegation. But then Fairman says that this simply
reduces to notice pleading. If you need
more information for notice, then you need to articulate more facts in the
pleading.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Let us return to the
case. What’s missing from the insurance
company’s allegations? What is <span
class=SpellE>Stradford’s</span> fraudulent conduct? The insurance company believes that he lied
about when his pipes froze, saying that it happened while he was covered when
it really happened after his coverage lapsed. He would have gotten away with it, too, if he hadn’t gotten greedy! We can figure out when the fraud occurs from
the complaint. Where did the fraud
occur? It most likely occurred at the
office. Would it be hard to restate this
claim to meet the particularity requirement that the court wants? No way! So why bother? The plaintiff wins
on the small point, but the defendant wins out in the end because they’re
allowed to move for summary judgment. The motion to dismiss based on Rule 9(b) is granted, so the claim fails
to meet heightened pleading under the Rule. But the amended complaint is immediately accepted. The remedy, typically, is that the insurance
company gets the right to <span class=SpellE>replead</span>, or, in other
words, to try again. As a general rule,
the courts will give you a second chance and sometimes more at getting the
pleadings right. Here it will be pretty
easy.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>It looks like the judge has
taken a peek at the merits and found that <span class=SpellE>Stradford</span>
is a liar and will get booted. So the
question of who wins here is both easy <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
difficult. There will be zero damages
for the plaintiff. Why did the insurance
company counterclaim for fraud? It’s all
about the punitive damages!!! They want
to do <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>more</i> than win. They want to win and beat the guy down by
getting punitive damages. This case will
actually make money for the insurance company (if the dentist has any money).</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>As to common law fraud,
heightened pleading doesn’t do a whole lot of mischief or havoc. These claims are tried and resolved on a
daily basis. But heightened pleading
doesn’t keep itself neatly contained to where the rules provide for it. Yeazell mentions two other big areas: the
first is civil rights cases, like <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Leatherman</i></span> and <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Swierkiewicz</i></span>. So in <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Leatherman</i></span>, it
was a <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monell</i></span>
action against the cops and the city. Cities used to have immunity until the Supreme Court decided <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monell</i></span>: cities
can be liable if they have a policy or practice of unconstitutional
violations. But in the Fifth Circuit and
many others, courts required heightened pleading for civil rights cases even
though the Rules have no provision for that whatsoever. The city in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Leatherman</i></span> filed a 12(b<span
class=GramE>)(</span>6) motion for failure to meet the heightened pleading
standard. That created a circuit split,
because the Ninth Circuit disagreed. In
a really short decision by Rehnquist, they said: “Look at the rules! Heightened pleading for fraud and mistake, not
civil rights! You’re wrong!” So Fairman came along in the aftermath of <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Leatherman</i></span>. He wrote a note on the circuit split before <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Leatherman</i></span>…and of
course, now the question is answered, so he didn’t get published. Undeterred, he eventually got his big article
published in the Texas Law Review. So
there you go.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There’s a whole bunch of
stuff that’s requiring heightened pleading even though they shouldn’t! There’s this slim comment from Rehnquist
saying that heightened pleading might be okay with civil rights cases against
“individual government actors” who are entitled to qualified immunity. So much law was made from that sentence. There was another circuit split! The Seventh and Tenth Circuits said: “<span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Leatherman</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>says what it says”. The Fifth and Eleventh Circuits said:
“Heightened pleading okay in everything but <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monell</i></span>.” The Ninth and D.C. Circuits said heightened
pleading is okay if intent is an element of the constitutional tort.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Say there’s a police officer
using excessive force. Actually, intent
doesn’t matter. In the Ninth Circuit,
notice pleading would rule. But if you
allege judicial deception by an officer in obtaining a search warrant, for
example, the officer’s intent is an element of the offense. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The Ninth and D.C. Circuits say that in this
case you should have heightened pleading. The Rules explicitly say that intent can be pled generally! How do you plead facts about the defendant’s
intent? Only the defendant knows what
was intended!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The Fifth Circuit is even
weirder! They hate to be reversed! They sort of reverse the Supreme Court! They come up with this alternative system using
Rule 7 and replies to answers. Here we
have <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Schultea</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Wood</i>, where the Fifth Circuit
cleverly decides that they will require notice pleading for civil rights cases,
an answer, and then, if there is qualified immunity <span class=GramE>involved,</span>
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>heightened</i> reply from the
plaintiff! The Rules don’t seem to
explicitly prohibit this. The Supreme
Court actually approves of this in a later case! Unbelievable!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Because of the confusion and
resistance that resulted from <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Leatherman</i></span>, the Court had to revisit the issue in <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Swierkiewicz</i></span>,
which dealt with an unpublished Second Circuit opinion. The court basically refuses to accept <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Leatherman</i></span>! The court grants cert on the issue of whether
an employee suing his employer must do anything more than put the employer on
notice. The court reverses with the
exact same rationale!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>You’d think this
would be the end of the story, but it’s not! Then we get the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Haltom

some <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monell</i></span>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There’s at least one category
of cases that’s handled outside of the rubric of the Federal Rules. Courts have imposed heightened pleading
without any Rules-based justification! The Supreme Court has slapped them down twice, in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Leatherman</i></span> and <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Swierkiewicz</i></span>! What more could the Court do? Why is there a resilience of heightened
pleading in the civil rights context? This has something to do with the pleading burden.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>But please note that the
Rules aren’t the only place we’ll get heightened pleading requirements. For example, the PSLRA gets Congress <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directly</i> involved in creating procedural
requirements (as opposed to indirectly through the Rules Enabling Act). The statute creates two different burdens: a
general particularity requirement, which requires the statement with
particularity of all facts that caused people to be <span class=GramE>mislead</span>,
and a requirement to plead with particularity facts that show the defendant
acted with a required state of mind. Congress is directly contravening the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure! So they make the plaintiff
plead the defendant’s state of mind!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Congress was motivated to do
this because they believe securities fraud suits are largely frivolous. They want less of them, and thus they make it
more difficult to plead them. There’s
another provision that provides for a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mandatory
discovery stay</i>: once a complaint is challenged with a motion to dismiss
based on the statute, the court must stay all discovery, meaning that there is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no chance</i> that plaintiffs will be able
to get enough information to plead specific facts. But has the PSLRA decreased the number of
securities suits? No. Has it increased the quality of the
suits? <span class=GramE>Maybe.</span> But there’s a three way circuit split, and
the Supreme Court has twice denied review of the issue.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The same particularity
requirement as to intent cropped up in the Y2K Act. Fairman fears that Congress is using this as
a technique to discourage certain kinds of lawsuits. So <span class=SpellE>proceduralists</span>
are annoyed! The Rules are usually built
up from the “grass roots” instead of being imposed from above. Fairman wants Federal Rules that are <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>transsubstantive</i></span>
– that have nothing to do with substantive law. Yeazell thinks that Congress is a better choice for making rules, since
Congress does approve <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> changes to
the Federal Rules. But usually they
would just accept or reject rules that have gone through the whole Rules
Enabling Act process. Fairman has no
confidence in Congress’s ability to get procedure right.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>So the classic “notice
pleading except for fraud” vision is not accurate in practice! But is civil rights an anomaly? No way! There’s heightened pleading in antitrust, RICO, conspiracy, copyright,
negligence, and CERCLA, too! These are
both statutory and common law causes of action, old and new! This became his second paper. Take antitrust, for example. There are cases in the antitrust areas that
will dismiss complaint for “<span class=SpellE>conclusory</span> allegations”
or “bare legal conclusions as to the facts”. Every jurisdiction has language like this, but the problem is that many
courts use this as a “euphemism” for heightened pleading! There are cases where there are no special
pleading requirements for antitrust. Other cases carve out a subset, like antitrust conspiracy claims, and
require heightened pleading as to the object and accomplishments of the
conspiracy. Fraudulent concealment is
dealt with under 9(b) and must meet the particularity requirement. More dramatically, some courts say you must
plead “facts with particularity sufficient to support <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>each element</i> of the antitrust action”. This is the infamous “<span class=SpellE>hyperpleading</span>”! Finally, there can be dismissal for
prolixity: too many facts! There you
have the “pleading circle”.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If you trace back where the
courts imposed all these different heightened pleading requirements, they
almost always go back to the “germ” of 9(b) and fraud, saying it’s “fraud-like”
or arguing that we should treat other substantive areas the same way. So Fairman wants to eliminate 9(b). He proposes leaving “condition of mind”. So that’s the next article! Coming soon!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The Supreme Court has so
muddled the substantive law of qualified <span class=GramE>immunity,</span> circuits
like the Fifth Circuit didn’t know what to do. They looked for other ways to protect defendants who they believed were
acting properly in their offices.</span></p>

is that he claims bad faith must be pleaded since the defendant has qualified
immunity. Who has to plead this issue?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>§ 1983 deals with deprivation
of constitutional rights under color of law. It creates a federal cause of action against government actors, acting
under their authority. But along with
this, the Supreme Court has imposed the doctrine of qualified immunity, meaning
the government actors are off the hook if there was an objectively reasonable
belief that the acts were lawful and that the officer acted with the belief
that what he was doing was right: both an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>objective</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subjective</i> component. If you have both, you’ll be off the hook. Qualified immunity is always raised by a

Marshall says bad/good faith is an affirmative defense. Why? It’s basically just the heightened pleading stuff we just talked

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Notice that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gomez</i>, on the law, is bad law. The case says describes the law of qualified
immunity as having two prongs: “objectively reasonable” and “subjectively
reasonable”. But the Supreme Court
changed that law in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Harlow v. Fitzgerald</i>
and struck the “subjective” prong. So
now it’s only a single, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>objective</i>
test. That’s not procedure, but that’s
what the law of qualified immunity is.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What are motions? It’s a paper document. When you file a motion, you must know what it
means in the jurisdiction in which you’re filing it. First, you need a document that provides
notice, which is often a single page document that is a notice of filing a
motion. Then you need the motion itself,
which may be short or long depending on the jurisdiction. That’s where you ask the court to do
something. The motion may have
supporting affidavits or other evidence attached to it. It’s also often accompanied by a brief or
memorandum of law in support of the motion. Often, you also supply a “proposed order” for the judge to sign if he or
she agrees with your motion. In some jurisdictions,
you can combine this stuff together, while in others you can combine it. We’ll just refer to motions in general.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>One of the first motions you
would likely file are pre-answer motions. The most popular by far are the 12(b) motions. If you litigate, you will consistently have a
docket of 12(b) motions to file or respond to. One thing about this motion is that it affects your answer date. 12(a)(4)(A) says that if you file any of the
12(b) motions, you don’t have to answer the complaint until 10 days after the
12(b) motion has been ruled on. That
buys you time, so there may be strategic as well as legal reasons to file these
motions. 12(b) is the substantive part
of the rule. It tells us that every
defense will be asserted in the answer except certain ones that you can make by
motion. That means that we <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could</i> combine all this in our answer,
but there’s no strategic reason to do so. Here are the motions:</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are other important
parts of Rule 12. Rule 12(e) is a motion
for a more definite statement. If the
complaint is too vague, the party can move for a more definite statement. This was </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:11.0pt'>Clark</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>’s
idea about what would happen if a pleading were vague: if you didn’t know what
they were talking about, you would file a 12(e) motion, giving the plaintiff
the opportunity to <span class=SpellE>replead</span> with enough detail such
that the defendant can respond. You
almost never see these used because the courts <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>will</i> dismiss you with 12(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>6) and not
give you another bite at the apple. After the plaintiff files the complaint, the plaintiff is entitled to
discovery, which means that these 12(b) motions are often coupled with requests
to stay discovery or to get discovery. There is also the seldom-used 12(f): a motion to strike! The court can strike from pleadings
“insufficient defenses” or “scandalous matter”.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>12(g) create the “hierarchy”
of 12(b) motions. Not all 12(b) motions
are the same. If a party makes a motion
under the rule but omits an available defense, they can’t make the motion
later. You basically get one shot to
make your 12(b) <span class=GramE>motions,</span> otherwise you have waived
those defenses. It’s a use-it-or-lose-it
rule, except to the extent that 12(h) tells you differently. 12(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>2), (3), (4)
and (5) are disfavored defenses and always waived if not brought up right
away. They all have to do with the
propriety of where the lawsuit is taking place and whether it’s proper that
you’re there. 12(h<span class=GramE>)(</span>2)
tells us that the defenses in 12(b)(6) and (7) are favored and can be used in
any pleading, judgment on the pleadings, or at trial. But you can’t make the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>motion </i>a second time. So
beware of this trick! 12(h<span
class=GramE>)(</span>3) says that 12(b)(1) is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>most favored</i> defense of all, and can be brought up at any time by
anybody, including the court itself!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>My opponent files a 12(b<span

motion to dismiss for improper venue. What do you do? They can’t file
it! They’ve already waived that defense
due to the combination of 12(g) and 12(h<span class=GramE>)(</span>1). So I respond to this by filing a motion to
deny the 12(b) motion on the grounds that it’s been waived by 12(g) and
(h)(1). Nothing happens on its own! You must raise the issue, or else you can
never raise it on appeal (unless it’s subject matter jurisdiction).</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Say the other person files
the 12(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>6) and it gets denied, but then they file a
12(b)(7) for failure to join an indispensable party. This is technical. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>What can we do? They can raise the defense, but they can’t
make the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>motion</i>. The issue is still alive, based on 12(h<span
class=GramE>)(</span>2), which tells us that we can still raise this. But 12(h) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>also</i>
says that the issue can’t be raised in another Rule 12 motion. It must be raised in a different way, like in
a judgment on the pleadings or later on at trial. Realistically, the judge will probably be
willing to <span class=SpellE>recharacterize</span> the motion as a motion for
judgment on the pleadings. We don’t want
to boot people out of court for labeling their motions wrong! That’s the whole point of the Federal Rules!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Say the 12(b<span

a more definite statement. Is that
valid? Nope. 12(g) says that you have to raise this <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>objection </i>along with your other Rule 12
motions. So you already waived your
12(e) motion, it will be denied. But
what if they had their 12(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>6) denied and then tried
to do 12(b)(5). No good, under 12(g) and
12(h<span class=GramE>)(</span>1). 12(g)
says bring them all at once or lose them! <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>What if they had their 12(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>6)
denied, but then they come back with 12(b)(1)? The defense is preserved! Can
they do the 12(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>1) motion? No, they can raise the defense, but it must
be done in some other form. By practice,
the courts allow you to raise this issue by motion, labeling it something
different, typically judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What if the other side just
goes ahead and files a complete answer? Then they want to move to dismiss for improper venue. Can they do it? Nope! Rule 12(h<span class=GramE>)(</span>1) says that the defense is waived
if it’s omitted from the answer. 12(g)
doesn’t say anything about an answer! It
only says that if you make a Rule 12 motion, you waive everything else.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Think of Rule 12 this way:
you receive a complaint. Here’s what you
should do: think about the universe of possible things you might be able to say
about the complaint. Do you have a
plausible subject matter jurisdiction argument? What about personal jurisdiction? What about venue? What about
process or service of process? Is there
a claim? Are there parties that need to
be joined? Could you get judgment on the
pleadings? Think about all the
stuff. Then you have to figure out what
you must do <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>now</i> in order to not waive
it. Can you save some of the stuff for a
motion for summary judgment under Rule 56? You can present challenges in a lot of different ways. There are strategic choices that you can
make, and there are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bad</i> choices you
can make. The Rules are designed to
encourage you to do certain things first. If you don’t do them first, you’re going to lose them. You must use these defenses either before
your answer or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in</i> your answer. If you make a Rule 12 motion, you lose
everything else unless it’s saved by Rule 12(h). That part explicitly gives us the hierarchy.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Rule 15 tells you that you
can amend your pleading once before the answer comes back. But that doesn’t help the defense. If you notice your mistake quickly, you’ll be
able to catch it. But the amendment
option won’t help you much in general.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This is stuff you get to do
as a defendant after the complaint is filed. We know something about answers from Rule 12 talking about the
interrelationship between Rule 12 motions and when your answer may be
filed. When you file Rule 12 motions, it
delays your answer date. So you file a
Rule 12 motion to avoid having to answer. You have to file an answer within 20 days of being served if you don’t
file a Rule 12 motion. 20 days is a
short amount of time! You always need to
check right away when the answer date is. But the Rules provide a way to extend this date. You get 60 days to answer if you waive
service of process under Rule 4(d). Pretty much everybody waives service of process these days.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>You have a duty, as a
defendant, to avoid unnecessary service costs. The Rules require people who get sued to avoid unnecessary service
costs. One way to do this is to waive
the technicalities of service. The
defendant also has to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pay</i> for service
if they don’t waive it. There’s both a
carrot and a stick! Also, waiving
service doesn’t waive any of your defenses (except of course process and service
of process). So there’s nothing to
lose! Rule 4(d) tells you how you go
about doing this. You attach a waiver of
service form to the complaint, <span class=GramE>ask the defendant</span> to
send it to you, and that’s it. You don’t
need to hire the sheriff or a process server. Nowadays, in corporate litigation, this is mostly done by counsel. You have a reasonable time, at least 30 days,
to return the waiver. You have 60 days
to respond! A plaintiff might choose not
to use this, though, if they’re in a jurisdiction where the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>state </i>statute of limitations is about to
run out. You may have to be personally
served before the clock starts. <span
class=GramE>As a plaintiff, worry about the statute of limitations.</span></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>So we have to do our answer
20 days or later. In the answer, we’ll
do denials and affirmative defenses. Denials are back in Rule 8. You
can either admit or deny the averments. If you don’t have enough information and you’re not sure, you can say
that too. When you can only admit or
deny part of the allegations, you must do so piece by piece. That’s where the case comes from, and this is
why you try to delay doing an answer. It’s a painstaking process! If
you fail to deny, you automatically admit! So be careful!</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'> – Zielinski is on a forklift and he gets hit by
Johnson. It’s a forklift wreck! Zielinski sues PPI. The other forklift said “PPI” right on the
forklift! But the problem is that PPI
isn’t doing that business anymore! It’s
CCI! There’s still a relationship
between the companies, but technically CCI would have been liable under tort
law for the actions of its employee. Basically, the wrong company has been sued! What’s <span class=SpellE>PPI’s</span> answer
to this allegation? They deny the whole
thing! The problem is that the
allegation contains a lot of stuff. Of
course you’ll deny that your employee was negligent. They should have denied the first part, that
they owned, operated and controlled the forklift! Then the plaintiff would have realized his
mistake and everyone would have been happy. But PPI is sloppy and doesn’t take the individual allegations
separately. That perpetuates the
plaintiff’s misunderstanding.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In discovery, they found out
that notice was received the same day as the accident. That seems to suggest that they sued the <i

company after a brief investigation. They weren’t trying to deceive the plaintiff. There was no bad faith. They were answering the questions to the best
of their ability and not trying to deliberately hide any information.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>So the accident was on
February 9<sup>th</sup>. The complaint
was filed on April 28<sup>th</sup>. The
answer was filed in May, discovery in June, and a pre-trial conference <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>way later</i>, when they’re <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>outside</i> of limitations: the right person
to be sued can no longer be sued! The
court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sticks it</i> to the wrong
person! That’s pretty amazing! The court will allow the wrong defendant go
to trial! The judge will tell the jury
that the defendant <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>admitted</i> that they
owned the forklift! This is absolutely
untrue and everyone except the jury will know it. How can that be? Where’s the justice in that?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The end result here is that
the court requires that there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deemed
admission</i> that PPI is the owner of the forklift, which means, essentially,
they’ll be subject to liability if it can be proved that they were
negligent. The judge gives us several
reasons for this: (1) <span class=GramE>It</span> was an ineffective denial
under the Rules. A proper denial would
have broken down the component parts, which would have been a signal to the
plaintiff that the plaintiff sued the wrong party. The plaintiff could have then amended his
pleadings. (2) The judge finds that
there was no bad faith. This is often a
consideration when judges decide what to do on the pleadings. What really underlies this case is the party
in interest here: the insurance company, which insures <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>both</i> PPI and CCI. As a
practical matter, neither defendant will pay the judgment. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>insurance
company will pay</i>. So it doesn’t
really matter who gets sued! The
liability will pass through. But you
can’t ignore all the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to get to that result: so
the judge says that it’s an ineffective denial. But we can see how this fact colors the procedural ruling. It seems like a harsh penalty, but in reality
it may not be since the insurance company pays either way!</span></p>

blueprint for the case: the pleadings spell out to the parties what is at
issue. When you get to the trial, Layman
has no idea that there will be this easement evidence. There is a surprise and notice element

the adverse party by surprise or would raise issues of fact not appearing on
the face of a prior pleading” must be in the answer. This gets away from having to characterize
every defense as affirmative or not. So,
if in doubt, plead everything if you’re not sure whether it’s an affirmative
defense. If you think you have any
colorable argument for it, list it. You
can always drop it later. But don’t be
stupid! You might get Rule 11’d.</span></p>

three ways to amend: one way for the plaintiff, one way for the defendant, and
one way the judge can help you out. You
may amend once “as a matter of course” before you get the answer. This is basically a plaintiff’s rule. The plaintiff files a complaint, and you can
amend it once before the answer comes back. If there is no responsive pleading due (like an answer, because there’s
nothing that comes after it), you have 20 days to amend it. Typically, you also have 20 days to answer
the complaint, so it’s kind of a mirrored rule. If you don’t qualify for one of these two windows, you must ask for the
leave of the court, which will be freely given as justice requires. But just what does justice require?</span></p>

judgment. The plaintiff now wants to
file her motion to amend her cause of action under Rule 15(c) to include a
cause of action for simple negligence. Rule 15(c) tells us that amendments relate back to the date of the

this language isn’t being used the same way as in other contexts!</span></p>

court was negligently managed by the facility. The statute of limitations runs out. He tries to amend his complaint with a new allegation of counseling
malpractice. The defendant objects,
saying that this claim doesn’t relate back. The court decides that the original claim and new claim relate to the
same facts, and so the motion to amend is granted.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Let us take the two cases
above together. Both people have
negligence claims, a statute of limitations that has run, and they both want to
amend their complaints. Aren’t they arguably
both wrong? In the second case, the
rehab center is sued for negligent maintenance of a basketball court. But then, the amended complaint says that
they counseled the plaintiff negligently. In contrast, in the medical malpractice context, if you get sued as a
result of a surgery and the claim is one for lack of informed consent, it’s
lack of informed consent because something went wrong with the surgery. Wouldn’t that give some notice that what Dr.
Baker allegedly did something bad in surgery? It doesn’t seem reasonable that the two allegations aren’t part of the
same set of facts. You might argue that
these should have been switched.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What are the
differences? Summary judgment was filed
in the first case. How would that make a
difference? It means that discovery has
probably come to an end. The motion for
summary judgment isn’t ripe until the close of discovery. That means this case is coming to an end, and
probably an abrupt one. In this case,
Dr. Baker is on the verge of victory. All of the sudden, he’s hit with a surprise of a new cause of
action. In the other case, discovery may
still be going on. So one reason the two
cases are different is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>surprise</i>
element. Courts are more willing to let
you relate amendments back if it’s not going to be to the detriment of the
other side. Another suggestion has to do
with the way the amendments were crafted. In </span><st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Moore</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, we start with the “no informed consent” claim and
try to go to a broader claim: general negligence. But in the rehab case, we start with the general
claim of negligence and then try to slice out a particular kind of claim. Thus, courts may favor amendments that move
from the general to the specific. Two
courts look at the same Federal Rule with the same language, but come out
differently. So the Rule doesn’t have
complete clarity on its face.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Notice that there is a
portion of Rule 15(c<span class=GramE>)(</span>3) that deals with changes in
the party’s name. The amendment will
relate back if you’re simply changing the name of the person you’re suing
because you’ve sued the wrong person. This is what Zielinski did. If
Rule 15(c) had been in operation at the time, this would have been the way to
resolve the problem.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>“All of the interesting
things in procedure relate to joinder.” We’ll deal with complex joinder issues, but today we must look at the
pedestrian issues of claim joinder. We
simply look at a combination of the Federal Rules on the one hand and the
issues of jurisdiction and preclusion on the other. Rule 18 tells us that a party asserting a
claim can do so as a claim (regular old plaintiff suing a defendant), a
counterclaim (if the defendant has a cause of action against the plaintiff
too), a cross-claim (a suit between the defendants), or a third-party claim
(like an insurance company or some other party brought in by the
defendants). In contemporary litigation,
we may see all of these at once!</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>. Could that
plaintiff do it under the rules? Rule 18
tells us that they can join as many claims as they want against the same
person! So if you’re just looking at the
Federal Rules, there’s no problem. But
we have to also look at jurisdiction; in this case, we must look at
supplemental jurisdiction. This requires
us to add additional claims against other parties, if needed. This stems from the Article III description
of cases and controversies as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gibbs</i>. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gibbs</i>, we had the same
situation: a state claim and a federal tort claim. Brennan says that they can both be brought if
they arise from the same nucleus of operative fact. Would they be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>expected</i> to be litigated together in a single proceeding? The claims we mentioned above seem to go
together well. These claims could be
joined properly under both the Rules and the statute.</span></p>

system, you bring all of your causes of action against a single person if you
wanted, even if they were unrelated. This is permissible under the rule, but not under supplemental
jurisdiction. The statute tells us that
we can join other parties. This is what
we used to call “pendant party jurisdiction”. So it’s okay! If you’re going to
party that would bust diversity jurisdiction, that’s not okay. So joinder of claims is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Claims are governed by Rule
18, but counterclaims are governed by Rule 13. There are two types: “compulsory counterclaims” and “permissive
counterclaims”. If a claim arises out of
the same transaction or occurrence, you must “use it or lose it”. In Rule 13(b), we have <span class=GramE>permissive
counterclaims, which means</span> you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i>
bring them and raise claims that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>don’t</i>

to disclose). The defendants
counterclaim for the unpaid balance of the loan. The plaintiff didn’t pay! Their counterclaim is that they’re still owed
money on the loan even if they didn’t fully disclose. So is the counterclaim compulsory or
not? One way to look at this is to flip
the situation. If the bank had sued
Plant on non-payment of the debt, would her truth-in-lending claim have been
compulsory? It doesn’t seem like she
would have lost her truth-in-lending claim if she hadn’t brought it up when she
got sued for non-payment. You wouldn’t
think that violating disclosure rules in a loan is part of the same transaction
as non-payment.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The court starts with the
rule itself, which gives us the test. Does the counterclaim “arise out of the same transaction or
occurrence”? There’s a laundry list of
different tests that can be used. The
court decides to use the “logical relationship” test. But not every circuit agrees that these two
types of claims have to be brought together. Much like the Rule 15(c) amendment issue, we have the same transactional
test that can be viewed by courts quite differently based on the test that they
choose and the spin that they decide to put on the facts. If you were cynical, you might find that the
Fifth Circuit is biased towards creditors and against debtors.</span></p>

on joinder of claims and parties. These
transactional tests that were in force in the claim rules are more rigid when

style='font-size:11.0pt'> – How is the situation above, separate acts of
negligence against a common defendant, different from this case? They’ve joined together and they’re filing
Title VII lawsuits against GM and their union. Should these cases proceed together (the ten plaintiffs against one
defendant) or should they be severed into ten separate causes of action? The district court decides to sever. Rule 20 is the permissive joinder rule, which
tells us that all persons may join as plaintiffs if they assert the right to
relief “arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of
transactions or occurrences”. Why do we
have rules like this? It’s a convenience
and efficiency rule. Let’s not have ten
separate lawsuits if they’re all really the same thing. The court in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

the rules want to bring the largest scope you can into a convenient trial
package to maximize both fairness and efficiency. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Why do the plaintiffs want to
sue together? This is all a matter of trial strategy and civil rights
litigation. You want the claims joined
so you can see a pattern of bad treatment by a common defendant. You need multiple defendants to be able to
testify! Here, the plaintiffs ask for
interlocutory appeal on the district court judge’s decision to sever the
cases. They don’t want to screw up and
then have to try the whole case over again. This is unusual, though. The
Court of Appeals doesn’t have to accept the interlocutory appeal. But it did here.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The court in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mosley</i> looks at both “transaction and
occurrence” and “common question of law or fact” in looking at Rule 20. They make an analogy to Rule 13(a). The language is exactly the same, so we
figure it must be able to guide us at least somewhat. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plant </i>used
a bunch of different tests in a wishy-washy way. The court here is willing to look at that as
part of an explanation for why the plaintiffs ought to be able to proceed
together. The Court of Appeals argues that the plaintiffs all suffered under
the same public policy, and that’s why the plaintiffs are logically related to
each other. With the “common question of
law or fact” part of the analysis, the court looks to Rule 23(a), the class
action rule. There’s a provision in that
Rule that requires <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>commonality</i> of
questions in a class. This isn’t a class
per se, but the court decides that the alleged discriminatory conduct becomes
the common factual characteristic.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>It’s all kind of
complicated. There are different classes
of people with different kinds of claims against different divisions. Does the umbrella of company-wide
discrimination hold true? Lots of civil
rights cases proceed as class actions because the plaintiffs represent not just
themselves but also others in the company who suffered the same harms. But this isn’t a class action! This isn’t a typical way you’d see courts be
willing to treat ten plaintiffs with different types of complaints, each
seeking relief only for themselves. What
could GM do if they didn’t like the fact that all the plaintiffs are being
brought together? Is there any way they
can remedy having all this tried at one time? Yes! Rule 21 can bust up joined
stuff…this is <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>misjoinder</i></span>. <span class=SpellE>Misjoinder</span> doesn’t
lead to the dismissal of the actions, but rather severing them and then letting
<span class=GramE>them</span> proceed separately. The court can also use Rule 42 to do this: it
allows for both consolidation and separate trials. It’s best considered as an efficiency rule.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In general, Rule 20(a) isn’t

whom you may be liable derivatively. It’s an efficiently rule. Is the
“nail as to steel manufacturer” lawsuit any different than “chicken coop as to
nail”? No! You can string these along for as long as you
want as long as you have a derivative liability relationship. But the court can still choose to sever these
cases if they think that’s most fair and efficient. But maybe “bad chicken coop, bad nails, bad

defective production? We look at our
logical relationship test, whatever that means, and it looks like it’s the same
transaction. The coop isn’t being paid
for because it’s defective, so the counterclaim would probably be okay under
Rule 13. It’s debatable, though. Could the farmer turn around and implead the
bank for failing to pay the bills? Sure,
it can be done under Rule 14(b)! It’s a
lot shorter than 14(a), but a plaintiff <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Let’s do some problems to
help set the stage for these issues and how they play into the supplemental
jurisdiction statute. Say we have a
single plaintiff who buys a car from a dealership. He thinks it’s defective. He sues both the dealership and the
manufacturer. There’s nothing fancy
about the lawsuit. It’s a single cause
of action with one plaintiff and multiple defendants. The plaintiff says: “One of these two
defendants or a combination of the two is liable.” Let’s say the dealer wants to file a claim of
indemnity against the manufacturer. Maybe the manufacturer is contractually obligated to indemnify the
dealer. The dealer can file a
cross-claim! Rule 13(g) lets you do
it. Rule 14(a) would have worked if the
manufacturer hadn’t already been in the lawsuit. Impleader could bring them in as a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>third-party defendant</i>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What if the manufacturer
wants to raise the claim that the defect was the dealer’s fault and not their
fault? They just file their Rule 8(b)
answer, where you put your denials and defenses. There’s nothing else special that you have to
file. You’re just denying your own
liability. What if the manufacturer
wants to assert a claim for non-payment of other vehicles other than the one
that’s allegedly a lemon? The only way
that the manufacturer could make this as a cross-claim would be to use 13(g),
but there’s no transactional relationship! They have to file a separate lawsuit. Can the dealer <span class=SpellE>countersue</span> the plaintiff for
not paying for the car? Yes! You don’t need the same transaction or
occurrence, depending on whether it’s a permissive or compulsory counterclaim. If it’s a permissive counterclaim, you can do
it under 13(b), which doesn’t require anything except that you have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> claim against the opposing
party. If it were a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>compulsory</i> counterclaim, then the dealer would have to bring it or
risk losing it under preclusion doctrine under Rule 13(a).</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Why wouldn’t Rule 18 help
us? It says that you can join as many
claims as you have against anybody you want! The Rules are a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>system</i>. Even though this Rule says that you can bring
any cross-claim you want, you must read this Rule as being limited by other
Rules that add more specificity. The
specific always trumps the general. If
this was the only Rule you were looking at, you would screw up a lot! You have to view the Rules as a system and be
guided by the principles that are involved in the construction of the Rules
themselves. You want to bring claims and
parties that seem to come out of the same events together because it appears to
be an efficient trial package. The only
problem that messes this up is if you have jurisdictional issues that make
joinder cumbersome.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> – Yeazell starts with the Circuit case to work us up
to the Supreme Court case. What’s going
on in the underlying lawsuit? Kroger was
employed by a steel company. They were
moving a crane, and he got electrocuted and he died. The widow, Mrs. Kroger, sues for wrongful
death. Who can we sue? We ought to be able to sue somebody. We could sue the employer! That would be a great option! He could sue the Omaha Public Power District,
which owns the lines and sold them. Then
<span class=GramE>there’s</span> the people who leased the crane, Owen. Everybody would think to sue the employer
first, but it’s precluded as a matter of substantive law by worker’s
compensation. It was an on-the-job injury,
which is part of what state tort law does. Who would we rather sue between Owen and Omaha Power? Who is more involved in these events? The plaintiff’s lawyer chose to sue Omaha
Power. Why did the plaintiff make that
decision? They ultimately bring a claim
against Owen. Maybe the facts weren’t as
fully developed when the plaintiffs brought the suit, or the plaintiffs’
lawyers didn’t do their homework.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What does OPPD do? They implead Owen. The suit was filed as a diversity
action. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Omaha</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> and Kroger were from different states. There was no subject matter jurisdiction
problem. Owen gets involved under Rule
14. The idea is that if OPPD has any
liability at all, it will pass through to the crane operator, who is ultimately
liable for the injury caused. At the
time the impleader action was filed, everyone thought that Owen was a corporate
citizen of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Nebraska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>. What <span
class=GramE>messes</span> things up is that once Owen gets brought in, the
plaintiff amends to add a claim directly against Owen. Owen responds to the third party complaint,
admits that they are a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  11.0pt'>Nebraska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>
corporation, but they deny every other allegation. It’s a truthful but not forthcoming
answer. Two years later, it’s discovered
at trial that Owen has its principal place of business in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We have jurisdictional
problems! A plaintiff may assert any claim
against a third-party defendant that arises under the same transaction or
occurrence. After summary judgment, the
power company has dropped out, and all that’s left is the claim against Owen. But there is testimony that Owen actually has
its principal place of business in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Iowa</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>! Diversity is <span

style='font-size:11.0pt'> on both sides of the “v”. What do we do? Isn’t this just a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Zielinski</i> issue? The court
in that case considered it “deemed admitted” that the defendant owned and
operated the forklift in question. Why
can’t we do that here? The lower courts
try to stick it to Owen due to deficiencies in their pleading and
strategy. The Rules tell us that subject
matter jurisdiction can be raised as an issue <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>at any time</i>, including at trial. How do we balance a Rule that says this is a favored defense against the
charge that Owen was trying to be manipulative and mislead the other party
until the statute of limitations had run?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What should the court do in
this situation? On the one hand, the
federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. If the court doesn’t have subject matter
jurisdiction over the case, theoretically the court has no power over the
defendant. It’s all a matter of whether
the court will give substance to that rule of law or try to ease out of
it. The Supreme Court views it as a
diversity issue. But recall the source
of diversity jurisdiction: Article III gives the federal courts power to try
cases “between citizens of different States”. It doesn’t say anything about complete diversity. Statutory jurisdiction comes from 28 U.S.C. §
1332, which has the same language. But
decisions like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Strawbridge</i> give us
the rule of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>complete</i> diversity, where
we interpret the statute to mean that you can’t have a party on one side <span
class=GramE>who</span> is from the same state as the other. Justice Stewart says that this is different
from the Rule 14 issue in that here we have a non-federal claim asserted by the
plaintiff that could have all been brought in state court. When you use impleader, you may not have other
options because you weren’t the master of the complaint.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>All of this answer that we
get from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Owen v. Kroger</i> is later
codified by the supplemental jurisdiction statute: 28 U.S.C. § 1367. It’s difficult. The general rule is that there <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> supplemental jurisdiction over claims
and parties that are part of the same case or controversy in a constitutional
sense. This includes joinder of
additional parties. That’s an efficiency
rule. What makes the statute difficult
is that this is the general grant of power that is then restricted as to
certain types of claims brought in certain types of ways. Subsection (b) takes away certain types of
jurisdiction. You can’t get supplemental
jurisdiction when jurisdiction is based only on 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (diversity jurisdiction)
and when you’re trying to join up people (in certain ways, like Rule 14, 19,
20, and 24) who would destroy complete diversity. So (a) says that you have supplemental
jurisdiction over claims and parties, but (b) says that if you don’t have diversity,
you don’t have supplemental jurisdiction, as long as you’re within certain
categories.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>So the intent of Congress was
to codify the result of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Owen v. Kroger</i>. How did they do? In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Owen</i>,
all the claims arise from the same case or controversy. We could have three different cases if we
wanted to, but it’s more efficient to put them all together. What about <span class=SpellE>OPPD’s</span>
claim against Owen? The statute
generally says that we’ll grant jurisdiction for anything that comes from the
same case or controversy, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>but</i> it’s a
diversity case, and you don’t have supplemental jurisdiction over claims made
by plaintiffs against third parties. But
this is a claim by a defendant, so there’s no problem! What if Kroger had a federal question claim
she could raise against Owen, like a federal statute about the operation of
cranes? Could she bring that claim? § 1367 says this isn’t based solely on §
1332, so it’s good!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What if Owen sues Kroger for
vandalizing the crane? The defendant can
certainly plead that claim, and § 1367(b) wouldn’t get in the way because it’s
not the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>plaintiff’s</i> claim. It’s a claim by a third-party defendant
against a plaintiff, which doesn’t fall into any of the § 1367(b) excluded
categories. Therefore, it must be okay! If that’s okay, can Kroger then bring the
wrongful death claim? Is it a compulsory
counterclaim? Check out the
statute. Yeazell says that Kroger is now
acting as a defendant, but Fairman says that the statute doesn’t allow
this. Kroger is still a plaintiff! It looks like the wrongful death claim is
still a claim made by a plaintiff against a person made a party under Rule
14. This is one of the big problems of
the statute: plaintiffs’ defensive claims barred by § 1367(b). It doesn’t make any sense for them to be
precluded, because the plaintiff was acting as if it were a defendant.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Say we have a plaintiff from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

style='font-size:11.0pt'> with a state negligence claim against a Texan. Let’s say the plaintiff uses Rule 20(a) to

  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span

the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>absolute subversion</i> of complete
diversity. The original lawsuit is okay,
<span class=GramE>then</span> you add someone later who will mess up complete
diversity. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

20. It’s a claim by a plaintiff against
a defendant! Had the drafters of the
statute thought about it, they would have included this situation. This is the so-called “gaping hole”! No court has ever allowed this to go forward. It has always been rejected on the ground
that it’s so gross a violation of the concept of complete diversity that no
matter how clear the statute seems on its face, decisions like <i

want them involved in the lawsuit? If
the plaintiff loses the federal suit, he doesn’t necessarily lose the state

here. What’s the risk that the

even a close case! The district court
went immediately to Rule 19(b) to look at the prejudice factors, but they
failed to make a determination under Rule 19(a) that they were necessary to
begin with. By avoiding the threshold
question, they circumvented the Rule, according to the Supreme Court. You need to find a “home” for yourself in
Rule 19(a) before you get to the balancing test in Rule 19(b). The Fifth Circuit was so careful in its
analysis that it didn’t even read the notes to the Rule! Joint tortfeasors are not necessary and
indispensable parties! There aren’t that

only. There is a breach, and the buyer
wants specific performance. Is the wife
going to be a Rule 19 party? Is the wife
a necessary and indispensable person? There’s no way on these facts that the buyer can get specific
performance of the land contract if it’s jointly owned by the husband and
wife. Without the wife being there, the
court can’t adjudicate the wife’s half-interest in the land. This is something brought up by the defendant
trying to get out of the lawsuit rather than the plaintiff trying to join other
parties. Other examples would include
people with joint interests in property, joint obligors/obligees, represented

do? They go for an injunction in federal
court to keep the shopping center from breaching the lease. The basis for subject matter jurisdiction is
diversity. The shopping center moves to
dismiss because they think under Rule 19 Lord’s is an indispensable party. The motion is denied. It does seem like this case has a lot to do
with Lord’s. This was an appeal of the
grant of an injunction. We don’t know what
the result will be on the merits. The

center wanted to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over this claim against
Lord’s. Could they do so? § 1367(a) tells us that there is supplemental
jurisdiction over the same case or controversy, but the case is basely solely
on diversity. This doesn’t come under
the technical language of the rule. <span

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We left off with Rule 19 and

no jurisdiction problem. But the problem
is what happens if they destroy jurisdiction. In the first case, the court skipped over the (a) inquiry altogether and
went to the (b) inquiry. That’s wrong,
and we learn this from the Court of Appeals, which tells us that joint tortfeasors
are never indispensable parties. But we
know that a husband and wife would be indispensable parties for this purpose.</span></p>

relief be given in the kids’ absence? Sure. Will there be multiple or
inconsistent obligations without the kids? No. What about impeding the kids’
interests? It may depend on how we
classify the various interests. The kids
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are</i> Rule 19 parties, because the dad

store is a necessary party, but, in equity, should the action proceed or be
dismissed? You could also transfer to
another venue that would be more appropriate. The court could allow the lawsuit to go forward if it could cobble
together ways to limit the prejudice against the parties. In this case, the court decided that the mall

to a lawsuit where <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nobody</i> wants

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If a court wants someone to
intervene, they can almost always create a justification under Rule 24(b),
because there will almost always be some common question of law or fact. The district court will almost never be
reversed on appeal because the standard of review is abuse of discretion. There is not a whole lot of litigation
activity in the 24(b) area that’s helpful to understand the Rule. You have a relatively soft standard that is
efficiency-driven and is very hard to overturn. So much of the litigation activity is in 24(a): what happens if someone
wants to intervene as of right and is denied, and then argues on appeal that

United Nuclear, and a bunch of other companies. They want licenses! They want to
intervene! They argue that the people
who will be affected by the decision don’t have their interests
represented. The district court says yes
to United Nuclear, but they keep everyone else out. Kerr-McGee and the American Mining Congress
appeal, and the others don’t.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What’s different about United
Nuclear than the other parties? The
district court only let that one party in. They are the company that already was granted a license before the suit
started. The court argues that the other
companies are adequately represented by United Nuclear. The NRDC is trying to enjoin the issuance of
that license because it was issued without an environmental impact
statement. That was the event that led
to the lawsuit in the first place! So
United Nuclear could really be affected! It’s no wonder they’re included.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Why was Kerr-McGee
rejected? As a practical matter, their
interests must be impaired. It was
argued that Kerr-McGee wasn’t a party to the <span class=GramE>lawsuit,</span>
therefore they wouldn’t be bound by any decisions made in the lawsuit. They would arguably be free to litigate the
same issue in their own suit. The
district court accepts this argument, and the Court of Appeals rejects it. The Court of Appeals notices that, as a
practical matter, even though Kerr-McGee isn’t bound, it’s unlikely that the
Tenth Circuit would come to a different conclusion in a similar lawsuit as to a
different company. The Tenth Circuit
will use stare decisis to decide the subsequent cases! That’s the sort of “practical” impairment
courts look for. But why isn’t
Kerr-McGee adequately represented by United Nuclear? They’re different because one has a license
and the other is only a prospective licensee. Maybe United Nuclear would be willing to settle the other mining
companies out for their own benefit. The
divergence of interest need not be great to say that one party doesn’t
represent the other. The court doesn’t
seem to put a lot of weight on this prong, according to Fairman.</span></p>

required! They’re not a business,
they’re a trade association. They <i

potential parties. Will that interest be
impaired? Sure, to the extent that they
are the representatives of a constituency. Are they adequately represented in the suit? The district court says no way, but the Tenth
Circuit brings them in to represent all kinds of mining companies.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Gulf, Anaconda, and Phillips didn’t
appeal. If they had appealed, what would
the Tenth Circuit have done? It would
depend on whether they were adequately represented because there’s no question
that they have an interest that could be impaired. We have a big company, a small company, a
company with a license, a company without a license, and a trade association to
represent all the others. But why not
just bring them all in? The other
companies are defendant interveners who are trying to prevent the environmental
impact studies from having to be performed. The most entities you get, the more likely you’ll get extraneous issues
creeping into your lawsuit. So it’s not
surprising that Gulf, Anaconda and Phillips don’t appeal, because Kerr-McGee or
the trade association could represent their interests. They’re better off taking the free ride!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This is typical of Rule 24(a)
action in public law. What if someone is
hurt at a stadium fireworks show and sues the stadium, and then another person
wants to intervene as a plaintiff? The
second person won’t be bound by the first lawsuit. But if the outcome of the first lawsuit was
that the stadium wasn’t negligent, it could have implications for the second,
third and fourth lawsuits. But no judge
would allow the second person to intervene in the lawsuit because it’s <i

intervention by strangers in private lawsuits than in public lawsuits.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Rule 24 intervention has to
do with other people trying to “muscle” into lawsuits nobody wanted them
in. To intervene, you need to be timely,
you need to have an interest in the matter that may be impaired, and you can’t
already be adequately represented by someone else. What if a public lawsuit gets settled through
a consent decree? Consent decrees are
court orders that courts have continuing power to enforce. All judges hold hearings on whether they
should grant consent decrees. They may
hold them open to anyone who thinks they may have an interest. What if Kerr and United Nuclear protested the
consent decree but their arguments were rejected? Could they sue the NRC? The only way they could be precluded from
bringing a lawsuit is if they were parties to another lawsuit. But they weren’t; they were just participants
in the consent decree hearing. The
effect of such participation is what the next case is all about.</span></p>

judicial indecision as to who has the burden of bringing parties into
lawsuits. Is it the parties already
there who have the obligation, or is it the obligation of outsiders to monitor
where their interests will be affected? This case is good law for everything except the factual situation in
this actual case. The case starts out as
a lawsuit by the NAACP against the city of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Birmingham</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> and other government entities, claiming that they are
discriminating in their employment practices under Title VII. The parties want to enter consent agreements
with the city. The court has a hearing
on it and gives notice of the hearing. The Birmingham Firefighters’ Association filed a brief in opposition to
the agreement, and then tried to intervene. Their attempt to intervene was denied as untimely, and then the consent
decree was approved. The white
firefighters don’t like the affirmative action plan.</span></p>

class=SpellE>Wilks</span>’ lawsuit is dismissed. At the district court level, the NAACP argues
that <span class=SpellE>Wilks</span> and the white firefighters were bound by
the decision that came out of the original lawsuit because they had notice (and
in fact they participated) and they didn’t try to intervene in the lawsuit until
it was too late. The district court
accepts this, but they’re also protecting their own consent decree. What would <span class=SpellE>Wilks</span>
and the others argue? They argue that
they weren’t parties to the lawsuit, they aren’t bound, and thus they must be
able to attack in a new lawsuit. The

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The Supreme Court tells us

different rules. Are we going to have
Rule 19 be the important Rule for who is brought in or excluded from cases, or
will it <span class=GramE>be</span> Rule 24? The burden is very different. Under Rule 19, it’s the obligation of the parties already present to
identify the indispensable parties and bring them in if possible at the risk of
dismissal. But under Rule 24, it’s up to
the outsiders to make that decision and see if there is someplace that they
want their interests protected. In
short, it’s their responsibility to “butt in”. The Rehnquist 5-4 majority says that joinder (as opposed to notice) is
traditionally the way that parties are subjected to the jurisdiction of a
court. The idea is that the parties who
are already in the lawsuit have a better idea about just who they want in the
lawsuit and just who they want to bind.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Stevens, in dissent, says
that sideline sitters get what they deserve: actual notice plus the opportunity
to intervene means you can’t complain. If you could have butted in, you should have. There is power that comes from the preclusive
effect of judgments and their binding nature that makes courts reluctant to
expand it to parties who aren’t in the lawsuit. This case says that if you’re not a party to a lawsuit, you’re not bound
and you can challenge the result again and again. As a litigant, this becomes part of your
lawsuit. Who do you want bound? If you leave a party out, they can challenge
your result. Why not bring everyone
in? You might not know who’s in the group
you would be bringing in. Later,
Congress changed the law of civil rights to prevent ongoing challenges to civil
rights settlements, recognizing that there could always be a group not party to
the original lawsuit that could prevent closure.</span></p>

Rule 24. Interpleader comes in two
variants: (1) statutory interpleader and (2) Rule interpleader. <span class=SpellE>Interpleaders</span> are

as between claimants). You deposit the
thing with the court. So this is
different than regular old diversity jurisdiction, where you need complete
diversity. Where will these lawsuits
happen? There is an interpleader venue
statute, § 1397, which says you can bring the action in a district where one or
more claimants reside. How about personal
jurisdiction? § 2361 gives us nationwide
service of process! You can issue
process or all claimants and stop other lawsuits in order to bring everybody
together. Everything about these

if all your claimants are in one state and you can’t use statutory interpleader. Otherwise, it’s kind of a “dead Rule”.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Class action is an area that
warrants our study. The more interesting
aspects of procedure often relate to class actions. Class actions change the focus of
litigation. The system was designed with
the single plaintiff and single defendant in mind. When the Rules were created, class actions
were not much more than an afterthought. Class actions were rarely used until the amendments of 1966. Now, we have a class of plaintiffs unified
against a single defendant. <span
class=GramE>When you have a large number of plaintiffs, the person in control
of the litigation changes.</span> Most
of the controversy arises out of class actions because of the increased
importance of the lawyer running class litigation. It shifts the focus from trying cases to
settling cases. Instead of providing a
device to efficiently deal with cases that would be filed anyway, the class
action is viewed by some as a device that drums up cases that would never be
filed but for the device. Class actions
are thus a frequent target of tort reform proposals. The Rules themselves were changed in December
2003 to reflect these concerns.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Start with the text of Rule
23. There are prerequisites to a class
action. If a class action meets the
prerequisites, then it must be maintainable. First off, the class must be so numerous that joinder of all members
would not be practicable – <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>numerosity</i></span>. The
members of the class must have common questions of law or fact – <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>commonality</i>. The claims of the representatives of the
class must be typical of all members of the class – <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>typicality</i>. The representatives
must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class – <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>representativeness</i></span>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>How many people do you
need? It depends. You’ll never get a class that’s a problem
because it’s too numerous. The problem
is when you have too few members. There
is not much action in the <span class=SpellE>numerosity</span>
characteristic. Commonality deals with
whatever issue is at the heart of the class action. Typically, there isn’t much of a problem
because you’ve thought about what legal issues the class has. Typicality says that if the class as a whole
has certain characteristics, the named plaintiff must be like the people in the
class. <span class=SpellE>Representativeness</span>
has two parts, but tends to hinge on the adequacy of legal counsel. Class litigation is driven largely by the
lawyers involved, and they must have the experience and resources to adequately
handle the litigation. Before class
litigation begins, a court will conduct an analysis as to each of these
factors.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Next, we ask whether the
class can be maintained under Rule 23(b). The drafters of the 1966 amendments had three distinct examples in mind
of when they thought classes would be appropriate, and then one catch-all
category. The catch-all has caused most
of the problems. A 23(b<span
class=GramE>)(</span>1) class is one where separate lawsuits would basically
violate <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19</a>. Basically all Rule 23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)
is trying to do is use a Rule 19 standard when you’ve met the prerequisites of
the class: lots of and lots of plaintiffs who are too numerous to join.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Here’s an example of 23(b<span
class=GramE>)(</span>1)(A), incompatible standards of conduct. Say a city wants to issue bonds to build a
stadium. A group of citizens are opposed
to the issuance of the bond, and there is a group in favor of the bond. If one sues to enjoin the issuance of the
bond and the other sues to compel them, there is the risk that if one suit goes
forward, the city will be under a court order not to issue the bonds but also
to issue them, meaning they would be subject to inconsistent obligations. You avoid this by bringing the parties
together as a 23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)(A) class. Here’s an example of 23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)(B):
it’s kind of interpleader writ large. There are limited funds. Say
there is an insurance policy with lots of claimants who will exceed the value
of the policy. If you couldn’t use
interpleader, you could use 23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)(B) instead. There is almost no litigation over Rule 23(b<span
class=GramE>)(</span>1) classes. There
are rarely parties so numerous that they can’t be joined. Joinder takes care of 23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)(A),
and interpleader tends to take care of 23(b)(1)(B).</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Then there’s a 23(b<span
class=GramE>)(</span>2) class. This is,
in essence, a class asking for injunctive relief. They had cases like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Martin v. <span class=SpellE>Wilks</span></i> in mind: civil rights
litigation. The firefighters wanted to
represent themselves as well as future firefighters who the city might
discriminate against. We can call this
an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>injunction class</i>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The 23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>3)
is the catch-all class. It’s a loose
rule that gives a lot of discretion to the district courts. This is where the problems have come in. If the court feels that the class members
have enough in common and that a class action is a better way to resolve the
controversy than separate suits, then they can allow the class action to be
maintained. Courts don’t always go
through the listed elements. They ask:
“Are there small claims such that people don’t have enough money to sue
individually?” Then we have an
efficiency class. “Do we have mass
torts?” This would include asbestos,
tobacco litigation, and so on. Wright
didn’t think this was the right way to do it. In the context of classes, 23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>3) is an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>efficiency class</i>. For the other types, you must fit into the
criteria. Rule 23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>3)
gets <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>special treatment</i>. The class issues must <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>predominate</i> over the individual issues. That’s not so for Rule 23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)
and (2). The class action must be the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>superior</i> way to do the trial. Finally, the class action must be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>manageable</i>, which isn’t necessary under
the other classes.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>But there are other
requirements now embedded in Rule 23(c). There has always been a requirement in this section to say that the
court must hold a hearing on whether to certify the class. Now it says that they must do so at “an early
practicable time”. It doesn’t have to be
done first, but it must be done early in the litigation. The problem is discovery: once you qualify as
a class, you’re entitled to get discovery. If the defendant isn’t certain whether they’ll have to litigate discovery,
they’ll have to spend a lot of money preparing to do so, which places them
under settlement pressure.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Rule 23(c<span class=GramE>)(</span>2)(A)
is a new Rule that tells us that the court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i>
direct appropriate notice to the class. There used to be no notice requirement. All of us are probably bound by all sorts of classes that we have no
idea we’re bound to. We’ll never know
until we file an individual lawsuit. But
if you’re a Rule 23(a<span class=GramE>)(</span>3) class, the court must give
the best notice practicable, including individual notice, to everyone who they
can. This is a heavy burden! The plaintiff must bear the cost of
individual notice. If claims are really
small and plaintiffs are really numerous, the cost of providing individual
notice may exceed the recover cost. This
can effectively insulate defendants from suit. So the notice cost is not to be discounted! The court must exclude from any class any
member who requests exclusion. If they
request exclusion, then the effect of any class judgment doesn’t bind them. This is called an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>opt-out right</i>. When you get
notice, you can choose to opt out of the class.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Say a university wants to
raise tuition for only out-of-state students. The SBA president, who is an in-state student, wants to file a lawsuit
to enjoin the fee increase. What’s the
problem? Will this plaintiff meet the
prerequisites of Rule 23? The class is
probably <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>numerous </i>enough. It would consist of all out-of-state students
who will pay the tuition increase. Would
the class have a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>common</i> issue of law
or fact? Sure. They are all worried about the tuition
increase. Is the SBA president typical
of the members of the class? Nope. Will he be harmed by the out-of-state tuition
increase? Doesn’t he represent the
students as SBA president? Well, how
hard is he really going to litigate on behalf of his class when he has no stake
in the class? A court would probably say
that he is neither <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>typical</i> nor <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>representative</i>. If this were going to be a class action, it
would have to be a 23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>2) class because this student
is looking for an injunction.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Let’s say an out-of-state
student files a lawsuit asking for reduced tuition. Say the student files the lawsuit as an
individual. What’s the problem with
filing an individual lawsuit? The
student’s stake is relatively small. The
tuition increase is probably not enough to make it worth an individual
suit. What’s a strategic reason for
pursuing this as a class action? One
problem is that you can drag out the litigation until <span class=GramE>it’s</span>
moot (the student graduates). Also, you
get much more leverage when you bring a class action than when you only bring
an individual suit. But if we define a
class of both present and former students, then the issue will always be
live. You’ll band together for leverage
and ask for money damages. What happens
to the class? They must be a 23(b<span
class=GramE>)(</span>3) class. When you ask
for money, you’re a (b<span class=GramE>)(</span>3) class, which means you’ve
brought in all the burdens of (b)(3). You have the burden of individual notice. You must show that this is the best way to do
the litigation. You must show that it’s
manageable.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Rule 23 sets up two different
categories: the prerequisites under Rule 23(a), (1) <span class=SpellE>numerosity</span>,
(2) commonality, (3) typicality, and (4) <span class=SpellE>representativeness</span>,
and maintaining your class status under Rule 23(b), (1) inconsistent adjudication
classes, (2) injunction classes, or (3) efficiency classes. If you come under the Rule 23(b<span

restrictive and expensive.</span></p>

categories of the rule to see if the categories are met. That’s what the case suggests, but the notes

whether you want the case to go ahead. This is especially true with the issues of typicality and <span
class=SpellE>representativeness</span>. What’s at issue in this case? There’s a Title IX claim that the Michigan High School Athletic
Association discriminated against female athletes. The Athletic Association fails to sanction
certain girls’ sports, makes girls play non-traditional, shorter seasons, on
inferior dates, in inferior facilities, and with inadequate resources. They have a bunch of complaints.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>They try to certify a class
of “all present and future female student athletes enrolled in member high
schools who participate in interscholastic athletics or who are deterred from

described, which is by way of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>characteristics</i>. This class is quite sweeping. It includes present and future female
students. It includes those who
participated and those who didn’t participate because of the discrimination. The class is limited to people who were

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The court must decide whether

plaintiff graduates. So we have an
organization trying to deal with the class issues on behalf of all of these
female students.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There is no problem with <span
class=SpellE>numerosity</span> here. There are lots and lots of present and future students. There are a bunch of common issues of law or
fact. Though the different types of
complaints might apply differently to different individuals, there must be at
least one issue common to all the class members. What about typicality? No one is probably going to suffer all the
harms. That’s why they let a community
group go forward as a collective representative. But it is likely they will later add
specific, named students who suffered some of the specific harms listed. Also, some of the class members might have
competing interests. The remedy that
might be crafted might be good for some class members and not others. How do we solve the problem? You can divide the class into subclasses
under Rule 23(c<span class=GramE>)(</span>4)(B). You could have subclasses based on people who
fall into different subcategories. How
about <span class=SpellE>representativeness</span>? You wouldn’t be part of the class if you’re
not adversely affected. That’s why you
include that language: to avoid <span class=SpellE>representativeness</span>

define the group! You can define away

they didn’t comply with disclosure requirements. Heaven sued for statutory damages but no
actual damages. She wanted to certify a
23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>3) class. The trust company counterclaims, saying that individual class members
failed to pay their lease. This is
similar to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plant v. Blazer Financial
Services, Inc.</i> in that if there are compulsory counterclaims, the court
says you must deny the class certification of the plaintiffs. Is this court bound by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

Eleventh Circuit used to be part of the Fifth Circuit! So the court must boot the case for failing
to meet the requirement in Rule 23(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>3) that this
class action is superior to other ways to adjudicate the dispute. This <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could

Eleventh Circuit adds its own caveat, which is that they might have done it
differently, but the district court didn’t abuse its discretion in booting the
whole thing.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>How do we end class
actions? How do lawyers get paid? This is the issue that has created the most
controversy behind class actions. There
is the perception that the lawyers get lots of money but the class itself gets
next to nothing. Lawyers could get an hourly
rate or work on contingency. But if the
class is highly nebulous, the named plaintiffs don’t want to bear this
burden. You can’t enter a contingency
agreement with an unknown class. So here
we have the common fund doctrine, which allows for the lawyers to be paid out
of the pool of money that they are able to acquire for the class itself. As they create a fund for the relief of the
plaintiff class, they get paid out of it. This arrangement has a contingency “flavor” to it. Typically, the common fund doctrine uses the
lodestar: a calculation of how many hours one would reasonably expect to spend
on the litigation times a reasonable hourly rate.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Say we have a solo
practitioner working for a class of automobile consumers who have been
overcharged. He spends three years on
the case and gets a $100,000 settlement on the behalf of the class. He works 1500 billable hours over those three
years. As a solo practitioner, he
wouldn’t have charged as much as an experienced attorney, but an experienced
attorney would have done it faster. We
will give him $75 because that’s what he’s worth. How many hours will we credit him for? It would have taken the experienced attorney
less time. If we had $75 times 1300
hours, we would have to pay the lawyer just under $100,000. The plaintiffs would only get $12.50
each! That’s stupid.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What if we have a 500 person
class suing some defendant? The
defendant makes a settlement offer that will give $95,000 to the lawyer and
$5,000 to the class. Should the court
approve it? Does it just look at a bribe
to the lawyer? The class plaintiffs would
probably object. The Rules have been
recently amended to empower the court to do specific things in this
situation. Rule 23(h) is brand new and
talks about attorneys’ fees in class actions. The court may award reasonable attorneys’ fees. It must be done by motion under Rule 54. Notice of that motion must be served on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all parties</i> in a reasonable manner. The class must be told about the
settlement! Then they have the chance to
come and object. The court can hold a hearing
if they want to. At the class counsel
appointment stage at the beginning of the class action, the court can request
the different lawyers competing to be class counsel to bid against one
another. But will this really happen? Could it be good for the class?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What are settlement class
actions? They are class actions where
the complaint, answer, class certification and settlement are filed
simultaneously. The parties have already
worked out all the details. This is like
the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Amchem</i></span>
case. This is a framework that is a
target of criticism. It “reeks of
collusion”! Both sides have already
agreed how to settle the suit, and the terms are usually highly favorable to
the lawyers. Under the old Rule 23,
there were a series of “trash for the class” settlement class actions where the
lawyer would get a settlement offer that essentially bought off the
lawyer. Sometimes the named plaintiff
would get an “incentive award” that comes out of the attorneys’ fee award. How do mass small wrongs get righted? The 2002 reforms make it a bit tougher to get
such a high level of inequity. But have
the new rules done much? Almost no one
will opt out of class litigation because their stake is so small. The tradeoff is between trying to redress
many small grievances and giving a windfall to the attorneys.</span></p>

by trying to find “global peace” for the asbestos companies. They don’t get it, but that was their
plan. Asbestos lawsuits are filed all
over the place. Lots of people have
cancer. Procedurally, the court uses a
consolidation device that allows you to move cases around in the federal courts
for efficiency reasons. All of the
litigation goes to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, except for some in the Fifth Circuit. All the lawsuits get consolidated. The lawyers want a global settlement. We have “inventory plaintiffs”: people
currently dying. Those plaintiffs have
already filed their lawsuits. There is
no question that there is control over those through the multi-district
litigation. We also have a group of
future plaintiffs who haven’t filed a lawsuit yet because they haven’t been
hurt yet, though they’ve been exposed to asbestos. We’re hoping to get both groups into a single
lawsuit and settle it.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>An administrative plan was
proposed that would pay exposure-only plaintiffs in a similar way to workers’
compensation. Such a scheme would be
cheaper for the asbestos companies than lawsuits. It is proposed as a settlement class action
with all of the terms included. Both
plaintiff classes and the attorneys will get paid. The District Court of Pennsylvania certifies
the class as a (b<span class=GramE>)(</span>3). The Third Circuit says it’s not fair. The Supreme Court upholds the Third Circuit and says you can’t do
it. What’s the ethical situation
here? You couldn’t agree not to
represent future clients in return for settling a case. The ABA Rules forbid so-called “lock-out
agreements”. A lawyer can’t agree to
restrict his own right to practice law. What if they plan on settling all present and future cases? This seems substantially similar, but it’s
not technically a lockout agreement. The
global solution would be to bind everyone, which requires the use of
administrative settlement procedure. The
questions of law and fact in common must predominate. The district court found that the shared
experience in asbestos exposure and interest in receiving money is what
predominated. Ginsburg says Congress
should create the asbestos fund, not courts.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Notice that the current
plaintiffs get money, and the exposure-only plaintiffs get an administrative
settlement procedure only (just the possibility of money). Here, the lawyers are representing two
different groups with different interests. The inventory plaintiffs want money <span class=GramE>now,</span> the
exposure-only plaintiffs want money later. They could have remedied this by having separate counsel to represent
each of the different groups. But that
probably also would have blown up the global settlement: the exposure-only
lawyers never would have agreed to such a scheme.</span></p>

discriminated against and that they experienced a hostile work
environment. What information do the

information about other employees’ complaints. This case comes up before the court on a motion to compel under Rule
37. Under Rule 26(b), parties may obtain
discovery under any matter not privileged that is relevant to the claim or
defense. Are other people’s complaints
relevant to these plaintiffs’ claims? The key is that to have a hostile work environment, it must be
widespread. So if there are other
complaints, it tends to show that there is widespread hostility. This is what the Rule was designed to bring
in as discoverable! What would have
happened under the old “subject matter” Rule? It would have been the same, and it’s hard to see what the big change is

he appeals to the D.C. Circuit. The only
reason there is a right to appeal on this discovery issue is that he’s been

his dismissal on the grounds that the discovery ruling and sanction were
wrong. Compare this to the previous
case: there was no appeal of the discovery ruling until the entire case is

insurance agreements, even though such agreements aren’t typically admissible
as evidence. All of this stuff must be
coughed up within 14 days of the Rule 26(f) conference. Date counting is very important! Prior to the 2000 revisions, the disclosure

a boss. She had a fight with her boss on
the way to work. There is also another
eyewitness who will claim that Albert is at fault. But that eyewitness has substance abuse

including discrete sub-parts. This
limitation is a response to what was seen as an abuse of the process. Interrogatories are cheaper than depositions. It’s pretty easy to write questions and send
them to the other side. But these are
also less useful: the questions are crafted by lawyers and answered by other
lawyers. As a result, you “game away”
any possible use of the device.</span></p>

side, and seven hours per deposition. You can have a full day of deposition of up to ten people. But how do you determine “per side” when
there are co-plaintiffs or co-defendants? That can vary case-by-case. These
are more expensive than interrogatories. They are more costly in terms of time (and consequently, money, in the
form of legal fees). But depositions are
very useful! You never know what people
might say! Rule 31 also offers
depositions upon written questions, but these aren’t very useful because they

they’re not party to the lawsuit. And
the interrogatories against the manufacturer are too numerous to be
allowed. But discovery rules can be
modified by court order under Rule 26(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>2). So we can ask the court to let us have more
interrogatories! But we have to prove to
the court why the case is so special that we should be given more
interrogatories.</span></p>

<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>discover</i> stuff. You can ask for depositions based on
“descriptors” under Rule 30(b). You can
say that you want information from a corporation about certain stuff, and then
the corporation sends someone who is competent to testify about that
thing. There is a lot of strategy
here. You want to offer up someone who
can testify but who is as ignorant as possible. You never want to offer up the CEO or president. They know <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lots</i>

can ask in a deposition. This is a typical
battle. The lawyer cannot tell the guy
not to answer except when one of several things is true under Rule 30. You could try to claim that the question is
not relevant because it’s outside the scope. But that doesn’t prevent the client from having to answer. They still do have to answer. But your objection is preserved for
trial. If you screw around during a
deposition, sanctions could be in your future. What if the lawyer objects for seven hours straight? What if you want to continue, but the corporate

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This is the most expensive
part of the discovery process. The Rule
itself, though it’s written as “the inspection of stuff”, has become more “the
production of copies of documents”. These documents include computer printouts, financial records, faxes,
and electronic information (such as e-mails). You list things that you want produced, and you can propound these
requests against any party. There is
also no limit to your requests for production. These requests are easy to propound but expensive and difficult to
comply with. The tendency is to ask
broadly – to define the largest possible universe of potential documents with
the hope of being able to score the best possible documents. To request documents against a non-party, you
must use a subpoena <span class=SpellE>duces</span> <span class=SpellE>tecum</span>
(“show up and bring stuff with you”) under <a

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This is a lawyer-driven
device. There is a tendency to interpret
requests very literally and narrowly. Unless you ask exactly the right question, you won’t get exactly the
right documents. So the plaintiff’s
lawyer starts by propounding requests that will be very broad. Then the opposing counsel objects, saying
that the requests are overly broad and unduly burdensome. A negotiation begins between the
lawyers. They try to winnow down the
scope of the production by negotiation.</span></p>

that the injury may not be quite as severe as the plaintiff suggests. Does the police department have to disclose
the existence of this photograph under Rule 26(a)? If they fail to disclose, they may not be
able to use it at trial. They probably
have to fork over the photograph if there is a Rule 34 request for
production. If you ultimately produce
the information before trial, you can argue that failing to produce it under
Rule 26(a) was harmless, which could avoid sanctions.</span></p>

problem! You use a subpoena. Let’s say we want to have a medical exam of
Barbara because she’s counterclaiming. Is
a court likely to grant a Rule 35 request for a medical exam when the other
party is claiming physical injuries? If
courts will ever do this, this is the situation where they will. Courts are generally reluctant to upset
parties’ privacy by ordering such examinations. If you get a medical exam ordered by the court and they request a copy
of it, disclosure of other medical reports both before and after that one may
follow. You can’t hide behind privilege

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>These are both tools that may
be used in certain contexts depending on whether the facts of the situation make
each Rule applicable. Rule 26(g) is kind
of like a mini version of Rule 11. There
are sanctions imposed for an attorney having signed discovery requests that are
“bad” for whatever reason (e.g. timeliness). But note that Rule 11 doesn’t apply to discovery. The typical sanction under Rule 26(g) will be
the fees associated with having to respond to the request. What if we wait until after the discovery
conference, and then you think it’s still too soon? You can use Rule 26(c) to get a protective
order to try to prevent the use of the deposition because you think it’s
premature. You use Rule 37 when the
other side fails to disclose something and they try to introduce it at
trial. Rule 37 says that if they failed
to disclose, then they don’t get to use the person or fact in the trial. There are more bad things in Rule 37(b<span

(g). Is it better strategically to seek
protective orders to prevent having to answer discovery, or is it better to

litigation? Is he a consulting witness

consulting witness. But you can get
discovery from consulting witnesses under exceptional circumstances. So are these exceptional circumstances? The defendant wants Dr. Lucas’s exam because
it was very timely. If her emotional
state is the result of having been fired, then you would think it would show up
in this report because she files her complaint way, way later. So the defendant’s lawyer wants to argue that
this report will have evidence related to being fired. If the report doesn’t mention being fired,
then she probably was depressed for some other reason. The court finds the report discoverable and

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We start with the question of
relevance. If it’s relevant, you’ll
basically usually be able to get the information, even if it wouldn’t be
admissible evidence. Let’s say it’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>relevant. Then you have to ask whether it’s nonetheless
discoverable because of an explicit Rule, for example, insurance policies under
the disclosure requirement. You’re required
to disclose insurance policies no matter what. There aren’t very many exceptions like that, but you must note
them. But most things that are
discoverable are relevant. Say something
is relevant. Is it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>privileged</i>? If <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>yes</i>, it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>is </i>privileged, then you have to consider whether the privileged has
been waived. That’s a matter of the law
of evidence. But the easiest example as
to waiver is attorney-client privilege, where there mustn’t be third parties
present for the communication to be confidential. The privilege must be waived if there are
other people around. If the privilege <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hasn’t</i> been waived, then you can’t get
the info. If the privilege <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>has</i> been waived, then we rejoin the
“main stream”.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If the information is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> privileged, we must ask if it’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>work product</i>. And that’s the same question you must ask
when you’re dealing with a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>waived
privilege</i>. What’s the difference
between the stuff protected by attorney-client privilege as opposed to what’s
protected as work product? If it’s not
work product, then you can get it. If it
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> work product, then you have to ask
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hickman</i> questions about whether
you can overcome that protection. You
use the Rule on trial preparation that defines the different burdens that must
be met. If you can’t overcome the protection,
you can’t get stuff. If you <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> overcome protection, then we have to
ask whether the information is from a testifying expert. If they’re not a testifying expert, you must
ask the “hardship” question: is there some other relevant need or hardship that
lets you get the information? If they <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are</i> a testifying expert, then you can
get the report and take a deposition.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There may be too little
discovery (or the “stonewall position”). You’ll encounter a person who doesn’t want to disclose information even
if it is explicit required. People don’t
want to disclose stuff that would be bad for your client, but you have no
choice under the Rules. If a proper
request is made for relevant, non-privileged stuff, you must cough it up. A mandatory discovery conference may be
required under Rule 26(f). Initial
disclosures under Rule 26(a) are designed to solve the problem of too little
discovery. There are certain categories
of information you must give up, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>period</i>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Next, there is the problem of
too <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>much</i> discovery. Sometimes millions of pieces of paper are
disclosed. But that may or may not be
responsive. There can be an ethical
question here. There are ways to control
this: under the general Rule 26(b), you can limit the scope of a discovery
request. There are also limitations in
Rules 30 and 33 on depositions and interrogatories. There <span class=GramE>are</span> compliance
Rules in 26(g), and you can also get a protective order under Rule 26(c) to
prevent having to respond. By Rule
26(g), every document you sign is signed in a “Rule 11” fashion. You certify that what you’ve done is complete
and in good faith. You can also get
motions to compel under Rule 37. It also
provides other specific “tiers” of sanctions under Rule 37(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>2). These become the “big sanctions”. Facts can be deemed established: even things
that aren’t true! Evidence can be
banned. Pleadings can be stricken. You can be held in contempt. Finally, there may be attorney fees and
expenses awarded regarding the discovery at issue.</span></p>

you must go before the court. You’ll
have to prove the damages before the judge so that the judge can enter judgment
for an amount. This isn’t particularly
cumbersome because there’s nobody on the other side. So in this example, it’s a car wreck so we
don’t have a sum certain. You’ll have to

reevaluation of the value of a suit. Most tort plaintiffs lose, so settlement for them is attractive. Even if you win, verdicts may be low, and
trials are expensive. So both sides have
pressure to settle if possible. Most
settlements are based on negotiations between the attorneys.</span></p>

make sure you get sued for malpractice. If you pay someone not to sue but then they turn around and sue anyway,
then you yourself will turn around and sue the lawyer who recommended the “<span

civil rights claims against defendants”, then you haven’t necessarily released
the unlawful discharge claim. What about
“in full settlement of any and all claims, known and unknown, whether based on

think about this provision when they signed up to work at Ryan’s? They probably just wanted a job. What’s the benefit to Ryan’s? It’s cheaper, faster, and reduces bad
publicity. But this agreement indicates
a specific arbitration forum: EDSI. It
turns out that in the Sixth Circuit, they won’t uphold this arbitration clause,
but in the Eighth Circuit they will.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The Sixth Circuit asks
whether EDSI is suitable for the resolution of statutory claims. What made EDSI suspect to the Sixth
Circuit? How they appoint the
arbitrators is a concern: one of the arbitrators is a manager of a company that
has an arbitration agreement with EDSI! They’re worried about bias. The
other two arbitrators are an employee and a lawyer, judge or “other
professional”. So the court is worried
about this. The court is also worried
about a bias due to <span class=SpellE>EDSI’s</span> financial relationship
with Ryan’s. Their business depends on
getting and keeping business clients. Also, the employee had to pay for half of the costs of the
arbitration. In court, the costs would
be based upon who won. But ultimately,
the court decides that the contract is invalid: there’s no consideration
because the terms are “fatally indefinite”.</span></p>

rule of Civil Procedure! How does the
Rule work? What happens due to <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Celotex</i></span>? You’re entitled to summary judgment if there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. So both questions of fact and questions of law can come into play.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Let’s say we have a creditor
and debtor. The creditor holds a
promissory note for the amount owed. The
creditor sues on the note upon default. All you need are an executed note that’s due and hasn’t been paid. If you can establish those elements, you’re
all good. If the defendant were to file
a Rule 12(b)(6) claim, he would lose because we accept all plead allegations as
true for the purposes of a pre-trial motion like 12(b)(6). The Rule won’t test the sufficiency of the
allegations if they’re made. What if the
defendant denies all these elements, but then at discovery, the defendant
admits that he hasn’t repaid the promissory note. So then do we have a situation where there is
no genuine issue as to any material fact? That’s right! How can we get the
interrogatory before the court in order to support a motion for summary
judgment? Rule 56(c) tells you that
affidavits and other discovery stuff can be used.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Rule 56(e) says that
affidavits must be made “upon personal knowledge” and give facts that would be
admissible as evidence. Not every
affidavit will be based on personal knowledge or include stuff that could be
admitted as evidence. So you couldn’t
submit an affidavit with evidence that would be hearsay if introduced at
trial. What if the plaintiff submits an
affidavit saying: “I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>know</i> the
plaintiff signed the note.” But this is
too vague to count as personal knowledge. If you had information that says the plaintiff watched him sign the
note, but the defendant says that he didn’t do it, then there is an issue of
fact for the jury.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Don’t mix up the “burden of
production” and the “burden of persuasion”. The burden of production is the obligation to go forward by producing
some evidence on an issue. That may be
the same as who has the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ultimate</i>
burden of proof, or rather, the burden of persuasion, which is the obligation
to convince the trier of fact to some level of certainty of the truth of an
issue. Judges can intervene to prevent
something from going forward in a lawsuit if plaintiffs cannot meet a minimal
showing with the production burden. But
if you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> make a minimal showing,
you’ll clear Rule 56 and have the chance to get before a jury. If the plaintiff can make a showing, the
burden shifts to the defendant to make some showing that there is an issue of
fact for the jury to decide. Otherwise,
if there’s nothing the defendant can say, the plaintiff will be entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.</span></p>

judgment, the defendant’s burden was to show that the plaintiff could not
prevail at trial. The defendant, in
essence, had the burden of production <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
burden of persuasion. The defendant had
to prove that the plaintiff couldn’t win. This case more or less moots summary judgment in federal court practice
from the defendant’s standpoint. The
burdens to prove that the plaintiff can’t win would be so heavy that you might
as well try the case.</span></p>

alleged that the defendant manufactured asbestos, that the asbestos was
unreasonably dangerous, that <span class=SpellE>Catrett</span> was exposed to
the defendant’s asbestos, and that it caused his death and damages. The defendant responds by admitting they
produced asbestos, but denying basically everything else. <span class=SpellE>Celotex</span> moves for summary
judgment on the issue of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exposure</i>. They claim that this plaintiff has proved
that he was exposed to their particular <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>type</i>
of asbestos. The district court grants
summary judgment to the defendant. The
court says that there was no evidence that the plaintiff was exposed to <span
class=SpellE>Celotex</span>-brand asbestos. The case will be dismissed. That’s because there’s no information that the plaintiff came forward
with that can show exposure to <span class=SpellE>Celotex</span> asbestos. That’s a burden they would have at trial as
to causation, saying basically “if you can’t do it now, what makes you think
you’ll be able to do it at trial?”</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The case goes up to the D.C.
Circuit, which reverses, saying that the burden of the moving party (<span

to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>negate</i> exposure, that is, to prove
that he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>wasn’t</i> exposed to <span

discovery, you can get summary judgment against a party if they fail to
establish an element that was central to their case and on which they would
have the burden of persuasion at trial. If after discovery, you can’t come up with any evidence of something you
have to prove at trial, then there’s no reason to try the case. Rehnquist suggests that this Rule operates
much like Rule 50 (judgment as a matter of law). When <span class=SpellE>Celotex</span> files
its motion for summary judgment, it has to say that the plaintiff failed to
produce evidence as to the exposure. As
to that motion, <span class=SpellE>Celotex</span> has the burden of
production. When they do that, the
burden of production then shifts back to the plaintiff. They get their last chance. <span class=GramE>Now’s the time they must

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>All of the Rules provide ways
in which judges can manage litigation. Should judges be a neutral arbitrator, or should the judge be more
active? How can judges push their docket
along and actively manage their cases? Rules 8, 9, 12 and 56 are tools the court has to manage cases. The discovery rules, 26 and 37 are more
tools. Rule 16 is the pretrial
conference rule. The judge can bring the
parties together before trial for whatever they want, basically. There are very specific things that the court
can do that are listed in 16(c). There
are 16 different things listed that can be done! The intention of this Rule was to have the
courts use this Rule to get rid of cases that they perceive have less
merit. If you don’t comply, you get
sanctions under Rule 16(f), which are exactly the sanctions you can get under
Rule 37(b<span class=GramE>)(</span>2)(B), (C) and (D). You can refuse the right to go forward with
evidence to support specific claims and defenses, you can strike pleadings or
dismiss the action, or you can hold them in contempt for failure to comply with
the pretrial order. The bottom line is
that there are a lot of things the district court can do, and some pretty heavy
sanctions it can use if you fail to do what it wants you to do.</span></p>

conference that it’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only</i> about the
lease. But later on, the plaintiff wants
to amend the pleadings to bring in a charge under a violation of
statutory/regulatory duty. The court
says: “Too late!” The court issues a
directed verdict for the landlord! The
appellate court found no abuse of discretion on the part of this judge. But think about this: the judge <i

want to amend the pleadings down the road, but then didn’t allow the plaintiff
to do so. What if the judge had <i

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>After pleading and joinder of
claims and parties comes discovery, then resolution without trial
(potentially), then trial. The motions
we’ll talk about today are motions that can come during trial. These motions can substitute the judge’s
decision-making for that of the fact-finder. The judge can also use jury instructions and keeping evidence in or out
to control the jury. There is also <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directed verdict</i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>judgment notwithstanding the verdict</i>, and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>motion for a new trial</i>. Where do these things take place? In a trial, there’s the plaintiff’s case, the defendant’s case, a jury
verdict, and then a judgment. After the plaintiff
has finished their case-in-chief (all evidence and witnesses), then it’s
appropriate for a motion for a directed verdict. If that motion is denied or delayed, it can
also be made after the defendant’s case in chief. After the jury verdict, you could make a
motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. So one difference between these two types of
motions is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>when they can happen</i>. But all of these are now subsumed into Rule

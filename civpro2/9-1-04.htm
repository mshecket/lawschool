          >Notice that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gomez</i>, on the
          law, is bad law. The case says describes the law of qualified immunity
          as having two prongs: �objectively reasonable� and �subjectively
          reasonable�. But the Supreme Court changed that law in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Harlow v. Fitzgerald</i> and
          struck the �subjective� prong. So now it�s only a single,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">objective</i> test. That�s not
          procedure, but that�s what the law of qualified immunity is.</span

          >What are motions? It�s a paper document. When you file a motion, you
          must know what it means in the jurisdiction in which you�re filing it.
          First, you need a document that provides notice, which is often a
          single page document that is a notice of filing a motion. Then you
          need the motion itself, which may be short or long depending on the
          jurisdiction. That�s where you ask the court to do something. The
          motion may have supporting affidavits or other evidence attached to
          it. It�s also often accompanied by a brief or memorandum of law in
          support of the motion. Often, you also supply a �proposed order� for
          the judge to sign if he or she agrees with your motion. In some
          jurisdictions, you can combine this stuff together, while in others
          you can combine it. We�ll just refer to motions in general.</span

        <b><span>Pre-answer motions � Rule 12(b)</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One of the first motions you would likely file are pre-answer
          motions. The most popular by far are the 12(b) motions. If you
          litigate, you will consistently have a docket of 12(b) motions to file
          or respond to. One thing about this motion is that it affects your
          answer date. 12(a)(4)(A) says that if you file any of the 12(b)
          motions, you don�t have to answer the complaint until 10 days after
          the 12(b) motion has been ruled on. That buys you time, so there may
          be strategic as well as legal reasons to file these motions. 12(b) is
          the substantive part of the rule. It tells us that every defense will
          be asserted in the answer except certain ones that you can make by
          motion. That means that we
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">could</i> combine all this in
          our answer, but there�s no strategic reason to do so. Here are the
          motions:</span

        <span
          >There are other important parts of Rule 12. Rule 12(e) is a motion
          for a more definite statement. If the complaint is too vague, the
          party can move for a more definite statement. This was </span
        ><st1:place><span>Clark</span></st1:place
        ><span
          >�s idea about what would happen if a pleading were vague: if you
          didn�t know what they were talking about, you would file a 12(e)
          motion, giving the plaintiff the opportunity to
          <span class="SpellE">replead</span> with enough detail such that the
          defendant can respond. You almost never see these used because the
          courts <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">will</i> dismiss you
          with 12(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>6) and not give you another bite
          at the apple. After the plaintiff files the complaint, the plaintiff
          is entitled to discovery, which means that these 12(b) motions are
          often coupled with requests to stay discovery or to get discovery.
          There is also the seldom-used 12(f): a motion to strike! The court can
          strike from pleadings �insufficient defenses� or �scandalous
          matter�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >12(g) create the �hierarchy� of 12(b) motions. Not all 12(b) motions
          are the same. If a party makes a motion under the rule but omits an
          available defense, they can�t make the motion later. You basically get
          one shot to make your 12(b)
          <span class="GramE">motions,</span> otherwise you have waived those
          defenses. It�s a use-it-or-lose-it rule, except to the extent that
          12(h) tells you differently. 12(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>2), (3),
          (4) and (5) are disfavored defenses and always waived if not brought
          up right away. They all have to do with the propriety of where the
          lawsuit is taking place and whether it�s proper that you�re there.
          12(h<span class="GramE">)(</span>2) tells us that the defenses in
          12(b)(6) and (7) are favored and can be used in any pleading, judgment
          on the pleadings, or at trial. But you can�t make the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">motion </i>a second time. So
          beware of this trick! 12(h<span class="GramE">)(</span>3) says that
          12(b)(1) is the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">most favored</i> defense of
          all, and can be brought up at any time by anybody, including the court
          itself!</span

        <span
          >My opponent files a 12(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>6) motion for
          failure to state a claim. The court denies the motion. Then they file
          a 12(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>3) motion to dismiss for improper
          venue. What do you do? They can�t file it! They�ve already waived that
          defense due to the combination of 12(g) and 12(h<span class="GramE"
            >)(</span
          >1). So I respond to this by filing a motion to deny the 12(b) motion
          on the grounds that it�s been waived by 12(g) and (h)(1). Nothing
          happens on its own! You must raise the issue, or else you can never
          raise it on appeal (unless it�s subject matter jurisdiction).</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say the other person files the 12(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>6)
          and it gets denied, but then they file a 12(b)(7) for failure to join
          an indispensable party. This is technical. What can we do? They can
          raise the defense, but they can�t make the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">motion</i>. The issue is still
          alive, based on 12(h<span class="GramE">)(</span>2), which tells us
          that we can still raise this. But 12(h)
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">also</i> says that the issue
          can�t be raised in another Rule 12 motion. It must be raised in a
          different way, like in a judgment on the pleadings or later on at
          trial. Realistically, the judge will probably be willing to
          <span class="SpellE">recharacterize</span> the motion as a motion for
          judgment on the pleadings. We don�t want to boot people out of court
          for labeling their motions wrong! That�s the whole point of the
          Federal Rules!</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Say the 12(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>6) is denied, and then they
          move for the 12(e) motion for a more definite statement. Is that
          valid? Nope. 12(g) says that you have to raise this
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">objection </i>along with your
          other Rule 12 motions. So you already waived your 12(e) motion, it
          will be denied. But what if they had their 12(b<span class="GramE"
            >)(</span
          >6) denied and then tried to do 12(b)(5). No good, under 12(g) and
          12(h<span class="GramE">)(</span>1). 12(g) says bring them all at once
          or lose them! What if they had their 12(b<span class="GramE">)(</span
          >6) denied, but then they come back with 12(b)(1)? The defense is
          preserved! Can they do the 12(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>1) motion?
          No, they can raise the defense, but it must be done in some other
          form. By practice, the courts allow you to raise this issue by motion,
          labeling it something different, typically judgment on the pleadings
          or summary judgment.</span

        <span
          >What if the other side just goes ahead and files a complete answer?
          Then they want to move to dismiss for improper venue. Can they do it?
          Nope! Rule 12(h<span class="GramE">)(</span>1) says that the defense
          is waived if it�s omitted from the answer. 12(g) doesn�t say anything
          about an answer! It only says that if you make a Rule 12 motion, you
          waive everything else.</span

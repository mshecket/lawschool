          >This is the most important rule of Civil Procedure! How does the Rule
          work? What happens due to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Celotex</i>? You�re entitled to
          summary judgment if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact
          and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of
          law. So both questions of fact and questions of law can come into
          play.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s say we have a creditor and debtor. The creditor holds a
          promissory note for the amount owed. The creditor sues on the note
          upon default. All you need are an executed note that�s due and hasn�t
          been paid. If you can establish those elements, you�re all good. If
          the defendant were to file a Rule 12(b)(6) claim, he would lose
          because we accept all plead allegations as true for the purposes of a
          pre-trial motion like 12(b)(6). The Rule won�t test the sufficiency of
          the allegations if they�re made. What if the defendant denies all
          these elements, but then at discovery, the defendant admits that he
          hasn�t repaid the promissory note. So then do we have a situation
          where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact? That�s right!
          How can we get the interrogatory before the court in order to support
          a motion for summary judgment? Rule 56(c) tells you that affidavits
          and other discovery stuff can be used.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Rule 56(e) says that affidavits must be made �upon personal
          knowledge� and give facts that would be admissible as evidence. Not
          every affidavit will be based on personal knowledge or include stuff
          that could be admitted as evidence. So you couldn�t submit an
          affidavit with evidence that would be hearsay if introduced at trial.
          What if the plaintiff submits an affidavit saying: �I
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">know</i> the plaintiff signed
          the note.� But this is too vague to count as personal knowledge. If
          you had information that says the plaintiff watched him sign the note,
          but the defendant says that he didn�t do it, then there is an issue of
          fact for the jury.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Don�t mix up the �burden of production� and the �burden of
          persuasion�. The burden of production is the obligation to go forward
          by producing some evidence on an issue. That may be the same as who
          has the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ultimate</i> burden of
          proof, or rather, the burden of persuasion, which is the obligation to
          convince the trier of fact to some level of certainty of the truth of
          an issue. Judges can intervene to prevent something from going forward
          in a lawsuit if plaintiffs cannot meet a minimal showing with the
          production burden. But if you
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">can</i> make a minimal showing,
          you�ll clear Rule 56 and have the chance to get before a jury. If the
          plaintiff can make a showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to
          make some showing that there is an issue of fact for the jury to
          decide. Otherwise, if there�s nothing the defendant can say, the
          plaintiff will be entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</span

        <span
          >At trial, the plaintiff had the burden of production and persuasion.
          On summary judgment, the defendant�s burden was to show that the
          plaintiff could not prevail at trial. The defendant, in essence, had
          the burden of production
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and</i> burden of persuasion.
          The defendant had to prove that the plaintiff couldn�t win. This case
          more or less moots summary judgment in federal court practice from the
          defendant�s standpoint. The burdens to prove that the plaintiff can�t
          win would be so heavy that you might as well try the case.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Here�s a wrongful death claim. When you look at the pleadings, the
          complaint alleged that the defendant manufactured asbestos, that the
          asbestos was unreasonably dangerous, that C was exposed to the
          defendant�s asbestos, and that it caused his death and damages. The
          defendant responds by admitting they produced asbestos, but denying
          basically everything else. Celotex moves for summary judgment on the
          issue of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">exposure</i>. They
          claim that this plaintiff has proved that he was exposed to their
          particular <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">type</i> of
          asbestos. The district court grants summary judgment to the defendant.
          The court says that there was no evidence that the plaintiff was
          exposed to Celotex-brand asbestos. The case will be dismissed. That�s
          because there�s no information that the plaintiff came forward with
          that can show exposure to Celotex asbestos. That�s a burden they would
          have at trial as to causation, saying basically �if you can�t do it
          now, what makes you think you�ll be able to do it at trial?�</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The case goes up to the D.C. Circuit, which reverses, saying that the
          burden of the moving party (Celotex) required it to support its motion
          with affidavits to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">negate</i> exposure, that is,
          to prove that he
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">wasn�t</i> exposed to Celotex
          asbestos. The case goes up to the Supreme Court on that issue. They
          don�t explicitly overrule
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Adickes</i>. Rehnquist says
          that after a period of discovery, you can get summary judgment against
          a party if they fail to establish an element that was central to their
          case and on which they would have the burden of persuasion at trial.
          If after discovery, you can�t come up with any evidence of something
          you have to prove at trial, then there�s no reason to try the case.
          Rehnquist suggests that this Rule operates much like Rule 50 (judgment
          as a matter of law). When Celotex files its motion for summary
          judgment, it has to say that the plaintiff failed to produce evidence
          as to the exposure. As to that motion, Celotex has the burden of
          production. When they do that, the burden of production then shifts
          back to the plaintiff. They get their last chance. Now�s the time they
          must come up with
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">any</i> evidence.</span

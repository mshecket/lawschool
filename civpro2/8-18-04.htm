          financing. We did a survey with stuff like pleadings, complaints,
          motions, joinder, discovery, and trial. This is a survey course! But
          it doesn�t teach you how to do stuff. It

        <span

          join claims and how to join parties). This is the bulk of the course,
          or at least the most important part. Then we go to discovery, where
          there are some <span class="SpellE">newish</span> rules. Then we�ll do
          resolution without trial (like motions to dismiss and summary
          judgment). We�ll look at trial (judge, jury, burden of proof, and
          stuff like that).

        <span

          and the Rules Enabling Act. The Supreme Court has delegated its
          responsibility to write the Federal Rules. There is the Judicial
          Conference, which has two parts: the Standing Committee and the
          Advisory Committee. Congress has the opportunity to accept or reject
          Rule changes. For example, should you be able to file things by fax?
          Lawyers say yes! It�s now in Rule 5(b<span class="GramE">)(</span
          >2)(D). You can deliver copies of things by fax as long as you meet
          the standards of the local jurisdiction.</span

          the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Fairman thinks this is

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One of the common criticisms is that we live in an overly litigious
          society. Yeazell challenges the idea that there is an explosion of
          litigation. Public perceptions cause Congress to make changes in
          federal practice. Tort reform and class action reform stem from that.
          98% of litigation is at the state level. Very little is federal. But
          the state rules are still modeled on the Federal Rules. We don�t even
          have an Ohio Rules course!
          <span class="GramE">So only 3% of litigation goes to trial.</span>
          Most litigation settles. Everything we talk about up to pleading,
          joinder, and disposition prior to trial is pretty much where
          litigation is. Very, very little gets to the trial stage. There are
          more jury trials than bench trials. Contracts plaintiffs and torts
          defendants tend to win. So Fairman and others think that tort reform
          is bad.</span

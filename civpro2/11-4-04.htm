          >Let�s finish discovery. There are three main points to take away from
          this material. (1) What is discoverable? (2) What tools do you use to
          get those things that are discoverable? (3) What about disputes?</span

      <p>
        <span
          >We start with the question of relevance. If it�s relevant, you�ll
          basically usually be able to get the information, even if it wouldn�t
          be admissible evidence. Let�s say it�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not </i>relevant. Then you have
          to ask whether it�s nonetheless discoverable because of an explicit
          Rule, for example, insurance policies under the disclosure
          requirement. You�re required to disclose insurance policies no matter
          what. There aren�t very many exceptions like that, but you must note
          them. But most things that are discoverable are relevant. Say
          something is relevant. Is it
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">privileged</i>? If
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">yes</i>, it
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">is </i>privileged, then you
          have to consider whether the privileged has been waived. That�s a
          matter of the law of evidence. But the easiest example as to waiver is
          attorney-client privilege, where there mustn�t be third parties
          present for the communication to be confidential. The privilege must
          be waived if there are other people around. If the privilege
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">hasn�t</i> been waived, then
          you can�t get the info. If the privilege
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">has</i> been waived, then we
          rejoin the �main stream�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If the information is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> privileged, we must ask
          if it�s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">work product</i>. And
          that�s the same question you must ask when you�re dealing with a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">waived privilege</i>. What�s
          the difference between the stuff protected by attorney-client
          privilege as opposed to what�s protected as work product? If it�s not
          work product, then you can get it. If it
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">is</i> work product, then you
          have to ask the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Hickman</i> questions about
          whether you can overcome that protection. You use the Rule on trial
          preparation that defines the different burdens that must be met. If
          you can�t overcome the protection, you can�t get stuff. If you
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">can</i> overcome protection,
          then we have to ask whether the information is from a testifying
          expert. If they�re not a testifying expert, you must ask the
          �hardship� question: is there some other relevant need or hardship
          that lets you get the information? If they
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">are</i> a testifying expert,
          then you can get the report and take a deposition.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >We can get protective orders that can prevent you from having to
          disclose information. There are Rule 26(g) sanctions, big sanctions,
          motions to compel, and of course the right to appeal. But when will
          the right to appeal kick in? It will frequently be way too late. At
          the core of discovery is the fear of abuse. There are three typical
          discovery abuse problems.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There may be too little discovery (or the �stonewall position�).
          You�ll encounter a person who doesn�t want to disclose information
          even if it is explicit required. People don�t want to disclose stuff
          that would be bad for your client, but you have no choice under the
          Rules. If a proper request is made for relevant, non-privileged stuff,
          you must cough it up. A mandatory discovery conference may be required
          under Rule 26(f). Initial disclosures under Rule 26(a) are designed to
          solve the problem of too little discovery. There are certain
          categories of information you must give up,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">period</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Next, there is the problem of too
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">much</i> discovery. Sometimes
          millions of pieces of paper are disclosed. But that may or may not be
          responsive. There can be an ethical question here. There are ways to
          control this: under the general Rule 26(b), you can limit the scope of
          a discovery request. There are also limitations in Rules 30 and 33 on
          depositions and interrogatories. There
          <span class="GramE">are</span> compliance Rules in 26(g), and you can
          also get a protective order under Rule 26(c) to prevent having to
          respond. By Rule 26(g), every document you sign is signed in a �Rule
          11� fashion. You certify that what you�ve done is complete and in good
          faith. You can also get motions to compel under Rule 37. It also
          provides other specific �tiers� of sanctions under Rule 37(b<span
            class="GramE"
            >)(</span
          >2). These become the �big sanctions�. Facts can be deemed
          established: even things that aren�t true! Evidence can be banned.
          Pleadings can be stricken. You can be held in contempt. Finally, there
          may be attorney fees and expenses awarded regarding the discovery at
          issue.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The exam will be based on pending real cases. But there probably
          won�t be a pending case that deals
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">solely</i> with a discovery
          issue. Fairman has also used short-answer, problem-type questions to
          test discovery. There should be old exams on file now.</span

          >Here�s another form of ADR. The distinguishing characteristics of
          arbitration are that a decision is made by decision-makers in
          arbitration, whereas that action is not the end result of processes
          such as mediation and settlement. The arbitrator
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">decides </i>the dispute and
          issues an oral or written decision. The main reason people use
          arbitration is because the parties can decides the rules of the game.
          They can make up their own procedure, rules, and substantive law. They
          can be as similar or dissimilar to �real� law as you want. Many
          arbitration agreements restrict or forbid discovery, pre-trial
          motions, knowing who is arbitrating the dispute, and the application
          of the rules of evidence. Arbitration is also usually faster, cheaper
          and more confidential than litigation.</span

        <span
          >What happens when courts get involved at looking at arbitration
          decisions? There are two places that this happens. Courts ask at the
          front end: when is it appropriate for a court to enforce an
          arbitration clause? When should they stop a lawsuit that has started
          from going forward or compel a party to go to arbitration? At the back
          end, when will a court review and possibly undo an arbitration
          award?</span

          >There are lots of cases against the steakhouse! What were the facts
          here? Floss is suing under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Floss didn�t
          want arbitration, but wanted to go to court instead. Ryan�s insisted
          on going to arbitration. There�s also an </span

          claim by Daniel. They both signed an arbitration agreement when they
          agreed to work at Ryan�s. But did the plaintiffs really think about
          this provision when they signed up to work at Ryan�s? They probably
          just wanted a job. What�s the benefit to Ryan�s? It�s cheaper, faster,
          and reduces bad publicity. But this agreement indicates a specific
          arbitration forum: EDSI. It turns out that in the Sixth Circuit, they
          won�t uphold this arbitration clause, but in the Eighth Circuit they
          will.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The Sixth Circuit asks whether EDSI is suitable for the resolution of
          statutory claims. What made EDSI suspect to the Sixth Circuit? How
          they appoint the arbitrators is a concern: one of the arbitrators is a
          manager of a company that has an arbitration agreement with EDSI!
          They�re worried about bias. The other two arbitrators are an employee
          and a lawyer, judge or �other professional�. So the court is worried
          about this. The court is also worried about a bias due to EDSI�s
          financial relationship with Ryan�s. Their business depends on getting
          and keeping business clients. Also, the employee had to pay for half
          of the costs of the arbitration. In court, the costs would be based
          upon who won. But ultimately, the court decides that the contract is
          invalid: there�s no consideration because the terms are �fatally
          indefinite�.</span

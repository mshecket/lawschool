        <b><span>Judgment as a matter of law � Rule 50</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >After pleading and joinder of claims and parties comes discovery,
          then resolution without trial (potentially), then trial. The motions
          we�ll talk about today are motions that can come during trial. These
          motions can substitute the judge�s decision-making for that of the
          fact-finder. The judge can also use jury instructions and keeping
          evidence in or out to control the jury. There is also
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">directed verdict</i>,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >judgment notwithstanding the verdict</i
          >, and the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">motion for a new trial</i>.
          Where do these things take place? In a trial, there�s the plaintiff�s
          case, the defendant�s case, a jury verdict, and then a judgment. After
          the plaintiff has finished their case-in-chief (all evidence and
          witnesses), then it�s appropriate for a motion for a directed verdict.
          If that motion is denied or delayed, it can also be made after the
          defendant�s case in chief. After the jury verdict, you could make a
          motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. So one difference
          between these two types of motions is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">when they can happen</i>. But
          all of these are now subsumed into Rule 50, which is called
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">judgment as a matter of law</i
          >.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >So look at the Rule and see what it does. The standard is very much
          like the summary judgment standard. Look back at
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Celotex</i>. Rule 56 has pretty
          much the same standard as Rule 50.</span

          >Here is a classic U.S. Supreme Court case from 1933! �If there�s a
          train, there must be a dead person.� What happened to the dead guy?
          There are some train cars. Then the dead guy, then more train cars. He
          gets squashed between some of the cars. What is the railroad able to
          offer as evidence on the issue of what happened in the accident?
          Employees in the group of cars that crashed into him indicated that
          there was
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">no collision at all</i>. But
          there is another witness who gives some evidence of a collision. But
          the Court finds that this witness does not satisfy the plaintiff�s
          burden of production. In theory, under the modern Rules, the railroad
          could have moved for a directed verdict at that point, and it would
          have been valid. Is the court weighing the evidence or trying to
          protect the legal interests of the parties involved?</span

        <span
          >What�s the difference between a motion for a directed verdict and a
          motion for a new trial? Directed verdicts focus on the adequacy of
          evidence. They replace the jury�s verdict with the judge�s judgment.
          It results in a final judgment. What about the motion for a new
          trial?</span

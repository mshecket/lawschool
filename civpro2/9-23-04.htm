<p><b><span>More on intervention</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Rule
24 intervention has to do with other people trying to “muscle” into lawsuits
nobody wanted them in. To intervene, you
need to be timely, you need to have an interest in the matter that may be
impaired, and you can’t already be adequately represented by someone else. What if a public lawsuit gets settled through
a consent decree? Consent decrees are
court orders that courts have continuing power to enforce. All judges hold hearings on whether they
should grant consent decrees. They may
hold them open to anyone who thinks they may have an interest. What if Kerr and United Nuclear protested the
consent decree but their arguments were rejected? Could they sue the NRC? The only way they could be precluded from
bringing a lawsuit is if they were parties to another lawsuit. But they weren’t; they were just participants
in the consent decree hearing. The
effect of such participation is what the next case is all about.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Martin v.
Wilks</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Up
until this case, there was scholarly debate and judicial indecision as to who
has the burden of bringing parties into lawsuits. Is it the parties already there who have the
obligation, or is it the obligation of outsiders to monitor where their interests
will be affected? This case is good law
for everything except the factual situation in this actual case. The case starts out as a lawsuit by the NAACP
against the city of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Birmingham</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> and other government
entities, claiming that they are discriminating in their employment practices
under Title VII. The parties want to
enter consent agreements with the city. The court has a hearing on it and gives notice of the hearing. The Birmingham Firefighters’ Association
filed a brief in opposition to the agreement, and then tried to intervene. Their attempt to intervene was denied as
untimely, and then the consent decree was approved. The white firefighters don’t like the
affirmative action plan.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Then
we have a new group of parties, featuring Wilks. They sue the city for reverse discrimination. Wilks basically has the same interests as the
BFA. Wilks wasn’t a party to the
original lawsuit and wasn’t bound by it. Wilks’ lawsuit is dismissed. At
the district court level, the NAACP argues that Wilks and the white
firefighters were bound by the decision that came out of the original lawsuit
because they had notice (and in fact they participated) and they didn’t try to
intervene in the lawsuit until it was too late. The district court accepts this, but they’re also protecting their own
consent decree. What would Wilks and the
others argue? They argue that they weren’t
parties to the lawsuit, they aren’t bound, and thus they must be able to attack
in a new lawsuit. The Eleventh Circuit
buys this argument on appeal.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Supreme Court tells us that the Eleventh Circuit is right. Why? It’s a battle between two different rules. Are we going to have Rule 19 be the important
Rule for who is brought in or excluded from cases, or will it be Rule 24? The burden is very different. Under Rule 19, it’s the obligation of the
parties already present to identify the indispensable parties and bring them in
if possible at the risk of dismissal. But under Rule 24, it’s up to the outsiders to make that decision and
see if there is someplace that they want their interests protected. In short, it’s their responsibility to “butt
in”. The Rehnquist 5-4 majority says
that joinder (as opposed to notice) is traditionally the way that parties are
subjected to the jurisdiction of a court. The idea is that the parties who are already in the lawsuit have a
better idea about just who they want in the lawsuit and just who they want to
bind.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Stevens,
in dissent, says that sideline sitters get what they deserve: actual notice
plus the opportunity to intervene means you can’t complain. If you could have butted in, you should
have. There is power that comes from the
preclusive effect of judgments and their binding nature that makes courts
reluctant to expand it to parties who aren’t in the lawsuit. This case says that if you’re not a party to
a lawsuit, you’re not bound and you can challenge the result again and
again. As a litigant, this becomes part
of your lawsuit. Who do you want
bound? If you leave a party out, they
can challenge your result. Why not bring
everyone in? You might not know who’s in
the group you would be bringing in. Later, Congress changed the law of civil rights to prevent ongoing
challenges to civil rights settlements, recognizing that there could always be
a group not party to the original lawsuit that could prevent closure.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Interpleader – <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule22.htm">Rule 22</a></span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
we have a situation where you’re holding on to some kind of property that’s not
yours and you don’t know who it belongs to. You want to protect yourself from multiple, inconsistent judgments. Impleader is third-party practice under Rule
14. Intervention is “butting in” under
Rule 24. Interpleader comes in two
variants: (1) statutory interpleader and (2) Rule interpleader. Interpleaders are great, but only if you get
all the parties.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Statutory
interpleader is more common. The statute
tells us the federal courts have original jurisdiction over interpleader
actions with $500 in controversy and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>minimal
diversity </i>(only as between claimants). You deposit the thing with the court. So this is different than regular old diversity jurisdiction, where you
need complete diversity. Where will
these lawsuits happen? There is an
interpleader venue statute, § 1397, which says you can bring the action in a district
where one or more claimants reside. How
about personal jurisdiction? § 2361
gives us nationwide service of process! You can issue process or all claimants and stop other lawsuits in order
to bring everybody together. Everything
about these statutes is designed to make it easy to bring everyone together.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the other hand, we have Rule interpleader. It’s a simple Rule. The Rule
doesn’t take away from statutory interpleader, but it’s still governed by the
rule of complete diversity. The only
time this is used is if all your claimants are in one state and you can’t use statutory
interpleader. Otherwise, it’s kind of a “dead
Rule”.</span></p>

Republic of the </span></i></b><st1:country-region><st1:place><b

<br/>

<p><span>This
is all about Imelda. Besides the shoes,
she had four fancy paintings. She gave
them to Braemer, an art dealer in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Braemer consigns the paintings to Cohen, who
is also in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Cohen gets stuck with the paintings, and they’re
not his. He wants to return them to
their rightful owner. But who’s the
rightful owner? He brings an
interpleader action under § 1335 against Braemer and the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. (The </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> claims that Imelda used government
funds to get the paintings, and so they belong to the people of their country.) How can we get the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> into the interpleader at
all, given that there must be claimants of diverse citizenship? Well, the claimants are minimally diverse.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Cohen
puts the art in the court registry, saying he’s the stakeholder but he has no interest
in the paintings. Why does Cohen want to
do this? If he gives the paintings to
the wrong person, Imelda or the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> can come in and sue
him! He might be liable for the value of
the paintings! Only interpleader can
protect him! Imelda tries to intervene
under Rule 24. But why didn’t Cohen
interplead Marcos in the first place? We
can’t serve her! We have nationwide service
of process, but not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>worldwide</i> service
of process! They have to wait for Marcos
to subject herself to the power of the court. But they can’t go and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>make</i> her
join.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Should
we allow Marcos to intervene? Yes. She’s timely. She has an interest in the paintings. Could her interest be impaired if she’s not a party to the lawsuit? Yes, because the paintings could go to
someone other than her if she’s not a party! The only way to get it is to become a party. Will anyone else in the lawsuit represent her
interests? No way! Everyone else is pretty much against
her. This is a classic case where
someone would want to intervene as a matter of right under Rule 24(a). If we could have served her, she would have
been interplead in the first place.</span></p>

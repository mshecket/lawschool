        1. What's your deal? <br /><br />I went to the
        <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/"
          >Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University</a
        >
        for a year and a half before taking a "leave of absence", which has
        since expired.

        2. Did you flunk out?

        <br /><br />No, I didn't leave because of grades. My grades were
        actually quite good, though they got worse the summer after my first
        year and were even worse my last semester (including a very generous C)
        because I stopped really caring. All my grades are now posted on the
        front page of the class I received them in.

        3. Can I count on your notes and briefs to be complete and correct?
        <br /><br />

        Not at all.&nbsp; I didn't brief all the cases, and I'm sure that there
        are errors.&nbsp; Take what I write for what it?s worth.&nbsp; However,
        I think some of my stuff is pretty decent.&nbsp; Also, if you think you
        can count on my website for legal advice, you are <i>crazy</i>.

        4. Do you have any notes about [x]?

        <br /><br />

        Nope, just the following classes:
        <a href="http://lawschool.mikeshecket.com/contracts">Contracts</a>,
        <a href="constitutionallaw/index.html">Con Law</a>,
        <a href="property/index.html">Property</a>,
        <a href="legislation/index.html">Legislation</a>,
        <a href="http://lawschool.mikeshecket.com/civpro">Civ Pro</a>,
        <a href="http://lawschool.mikeshecket.com/torts">Torts</a>,
        <a href="http://lawschool.mikeshecket.com/criminallaw">Criminal Law</a>,
        <a href="http://lawschool.mikeshecket.com/ba">Business Assocations</a>,
        <a href="http://lawschool.mikeshecket.com/realestate"
          >Real Estate Finance</a
        >,
        <a href="http://lawschool.mikeshecket.com/civpro2">Civil Procedure II</a
        >, and
        <a href="http://lawschool.mikeshecket.com/appad">Appellate Advocacy</a>.
        Don't bother even looking at the notes for the last four, except maybe
        Civ Pro II. I was pretty much burned out by then. But the notes for Civ
        Pro I are good and useful, as are those for Contracts and probably the
        ones for Property.

        5. Aaaaaaand whatchama doin' now? <br /><br />

        Well, after law school I did a masters program in science education for
        a while, but dropped out of that too. About a year later, I went to
        teach English in China for a year, and then came back. Then I lived in
        Ypsilanti, Michigan for five years, doing test preparation tutoring.
        Finally, in 2014, I moved back to Columbus, Ohio, and in 2015 I started
        working as an adult education instructor at
        <a href="http://www.godmanguild.org">Godman Guild</a>. I get to use my
        brain to help people in great need. It's the toughest and best job I've
        ever had.

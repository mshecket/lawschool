          that�s fair game. We�ll also be tested on statutory work: reading,
          interpreting, and working with a statute. There will be two types of
          questions: some questions will have a short set of facts and then four
          possible answers based on the facts. You have a �little mini factual
          pattern� and then a couple of answer. Some questions will be

          �Which of the following statements about insanity is incorrect?� Or,
          �Which of the following crimes is a general intent crime at common
          law?� These kinds of questions you can usually do in 30 seconds�you
          either know the answer or you don�t. You�ll spend longer on the �mini

          Sometimes, you will want to quote from the Model Penal Code when it�s

          This is our chance to demonstrate that we�ve thought about rape law
          and therefore, given the chance to see a statute that could become the
          law we can spot the strengths and weaknesses of it. We won�t compare
          this statute to what the real statute is, but we pretty much know

          clear, make it clear to Dressler! Point to the facts that allow you to
          reach that conclusion! It�s fair to say that on a law school exam
          question 90% of the exam has
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">no right answer</i>. For most
          of the exam, there are debatable issues. Your conclusion isn�t so

          Dressler has allocated more points to mens rea and self-defense than
          some of the other issues. The jigsaw approach would say that you
          should tackle the meatiest issues first. But that�s not the organized
          way to do it. It would be perfect if the big issues happened to be the
          things right on top. But by organizing in preparation, you say to
          yourself: �I�ve got to get to mens rea, but I also have to get to
          self-defense.� It forces you to think about and strategize about what
          you�re going to do when. Keep in mind that you can�t say everything

          The question is a Model Penal Code jurisdiction question, where we�re
          supposed to discuss the criminal liability of A for killing B. We know
          by now that the only thing that separates different homicides is mens
          rea. The voluntary act will be the same no matter what the crime. The
          social harm will be the dead person. What matters will be in the mens
          rea discussion. At that point, you can discuss any relevant mens rea
          issue. You should always start at the top, that is, with the highest
          mens rea that can plausibly be argued by a prosecutor. If the facts
          plausibly support the mens rea of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">purpose</i>, then that�s where
          you start and you work your way down. It may be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">obvious </i>that the killing
          was done purposely. If so, fine, and you don�t have to go down. It may
          be that the killing is clearly an accident, and the only issue is
          whether the killing is reckless or negligent. But start at the highest
          mens rea and work your way down. Cite your Model Penal Code
          sections.</span

          defense. It�s a denial that you had the required mens rea for the
          crime. Mistake �defenses� shouldn�t be talked about as justifications

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Pinkerton brothers were convicted of tax crimes. All the offenses
          were based on a single conspiracy.
        </span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Can we convict Daniel based on the conspiracy even though he was in
          jail at the time the crimes actually occurred?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          NEW RULE! In the case of a �continuous conspiracy�, �an overt act of
          one partner may be the act of all without any new agreement
          specifically directed to that act� unless a conspirator takes some
          �affirmative action� to withdraw from the conspiracy.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The majority finds that when you have a conspiracy, it�s �all for one
          and one for all� unless someone affirmatively pulls out of the
          conspiracy. Even if they didn�t physically participate in the act for
          which they�re charged, they can be found at fault just for being in
          the conspiracy.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Rutledge believes this goes too far. Since Walter was the only one
          who committed the actual crimes, and there was no evidence to
          establish that Daniel helped in any way, finding Daniel at fault
          imposes a very broad form of conspiratorial liability that this
          Justice is worried about.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> Daniel�s conviction is confirmed.</span>

          car stealing as an accomplice. B is only guilty of robbery, as is C. D
          is probably guilty of car stealing and he would be the accomplice to
          the two robberies of B and C. However, under
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Pinkerton</i>, I think
          everybody would be guilty of everything: conspiracy, one count each,
          robbery, two counts each, then also aiding and abetting robbery, two
          counts each, maybe solicitation, one count each, and car stealing, one
          count each. Maybe they�d also �inherit� A�s aiding and abetting
          robbery (two counts each) and aiding and abetting car stealing (one
          count each). That�s a heck of a lot of stuff!</span

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Du family ran a liquor store. The defendant didn�t usually work
          the counter at the store, but was working there on the day of the
          crime. The defendant thought the victim was shoplifting, and tried to
          stop her. There was a struggle, and the victim punched the defendant
          in the eye twice. As the victim apparently prepared to pay for the
          item the defendant thought she was stealing, the defendant first threw
          a chair and then shot the victim in the back of the head. The
          defendant made various claims at trial about not remembering firing
          the gun and not intending to kill the victim. The jury found her
          guilty, so it implicitly must have found that these claims were
          untrue.</span

          crime but recommend she be sentenced to prison.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> How much punishment is it just for Du to receive?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          A just punishment should: 1) protect society, 2) punish the defendant
          for wrongdoing, 3) encourage the defendant to be good in the future,
          4) deter other crimes, 5) incapacitate the defendant, 6) make
          restitution for the victim, and 7) be comparable to punishments for
          similar crimes.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court reasons that of these frequently used justifications for
          punishment, most either don�t give any guidance or suggest Mrs. Du
          should not be punished. The court says that there is value in
          punishing Mrs. Du for wrongdoing.</span

            >I debated between sentencing the defendant to the maximum term and
            letting her off on probation. The only reason I could see for
            sentencing the defendant would be to try to deter similar behavior
            in the future. I think even a death sentence may fail to bring about
            general deterrence, and of course the cost to Mrs. Du would be
            enormous. Therefore, since even the maximum penalty allowed by law
            would probably fail to deter, I would let her off on
            probation.</span

            compared to the possible long-lasting impact of a profoundly unfair,
            unjust, or simply illegal verdict. If returning a patently unjust
            verdict would save hundreds or thousands of lives that are
            immediately threatened, then this should be taken into account. This
            goes for the case of adjusting later verdicts based on public
            reaction to earlier ones. If the next completely legal verdict will
            cause a thousand people to die but an unjust verdict will kill one
            person now and five hundred in the next five hundred years, the
            court should announce the unjust verdict.</span

          >This is the final step in the semester. We�ve been talking about
          single people committing crimes to this point. Now we look at the
          extraordinarily common problem that most crimes involve more than one
          person. Who else besides the �trigger man� is also guilty of that
          offense?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >You must think about this issue and entirely different from Torts. In
          Torts, you talk about vicarious liability. The employer isn�t really
          negligent; it�s just that they hired a certain person who was
          negligent. What�s good for Torts is good for Torts, but this is
          Criminal Law. It�s much different from Torts. We�re looking for
          <i>personal responsibility</i>.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >It�s obvious if you �pull the trigger� that you�re responsible. But
          who else should be held responsible for something they did not do?
          That�s the question of this chapter.</span

        <span
          >Accomplice liability and conspiratorial liability overlap 99%. Most
          of the time, if you could be held liable under accomplice liability,
          then you could also be held liable under conspiratorial liability and
          vice versa. But not always. There are a few cases where someone is one
          but not the other.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The common law terms were make-or-break distinctions for prosecutors
          at common law. Virtually no state today follows the odd, technical
          common law rules that existed way back when. But even though that�s
          true and some of the distinctions between the terms have disappeared,
          you will find that courts even today will talk about defendants using
          those terms. To understand what they�re talking about, you need to
          refer to the original common law definitions.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >For a very long time, an accessory after the fact is no longer part
          of this analysis. That sort of person who is described as an accessory
          after the fact today is not deemed to be guilty of the crime for which
          they were accessory after the fact. We�ll hold them guilty of
          �obstruction of justice� or �misprision of a felony�.</span

        <span
          >The purpose of this case is to get the big picture of what it means
          to be an accomplice to a crime. Then we�ll go from

          friends were going to steal stuff. He doesn�t really help them. So why

          says that he�s a lookout.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span

          must be wrong. They have to claim, at best, that he�s a principal in
          the second degree. The reason they charged him as a principal in the
          first degree is because the prosecutor can charge anyone with
          everything.</span

      <p>
        <span

          no such crime as �accomplice to breaking and entering�. If you�re an

      <br />

      <p>
        <span

      <p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Then go to the mens rea. Did the defendant intend to do that act? Did

      </p>

      <br />

          aid in the commission of a crime.</span

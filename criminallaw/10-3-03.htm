        <span

          is the fact that they were Sheshont Indians living on a reservation.
          They were treated by the authorities a lot differently than other
          people. This helps explain what was going through their minds.</span

          what else is critically necessary to determine whether the Williamses
          should be punished? There�s a proximate cause issue here. We need to
          know the moment at which the Williamses should have known they had to
          take the child to the doctor.</span

        <span

          the doctor <i>before</i> the Williamses did, we need to know when it
          would have been too late to save the child�s life. In other words, if
          a reasonable person would have taken the child to the doctor too late
          for the doctor to do anything, then the Williamses shouldn�t be held
          responsible. If it didn�t matter that they were slower than the norm,

          whereas religion is something that you choose to believe in.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>It could be argued, therefore,
          we can be less sympathetic towards people who <i>choose</i> to follow

      <p>
        <span
          >Going back to <i>Williams</i>, should we be punishing negligence at
          all? The Model Penal Code does not look kindly upon punishment of
          negligence. Are we punishing people for character rather than their

        <span

          <i>incapable</i> of living up to the objective standard? It�s hard to
          blame someone who is not capable of being otherwise, but on the other
          hand, from a utilitarian perspective, we may want to keep these people

        <span
          >Do we have less respect for Sam and Tiffany�s behavior in Note 4, p.
          282 because their reason for neglect is so stupid? Does the fact that
          they were completely oblivious to the risks to their child make their
          omission worse than the Williamses� actions? Generally, we would like
          to come down harder on Sam and Tiffany than the Williamses, but it is
          hard to justify this result based on law.</span

<p><i><span>People
v. Casassa</span></i></p>

<p><span>Court
of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, 1980.</span></p>

<p><span>49
N.Y.2d 668, 427 N.Y.S.2d 769, 404 N.E.2d 1310.</span></p>

<p><span>Dressler,
pp. 256-260</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The defendant’s girlfriend
broke off their relationship. He stalked
and later killed her. In a bench trial,
the defendant argued the partial excuse of extreme emotional distress. The judge found him guilty of murder. The defendant appealed on the basis that he
wasn’t allowed the extreme emotional disturbance defense.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Did the defendant establish
the “extreme emotional disturbance” defense?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statute, adapted from the
Model Penal Code, says that in order to use this defense, the defendant (1)
must be found to have acted under extreme emotional disturbance, and (2) that
emotional disturbance must be one that the finder of fact can sort of
“sympathize” with.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court says that the
statute was properly applied because the trial judge, as the finder of fact,
made an effort to empathize and be understanding of the defendant’s situation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The court upheld the trial
court’s verdict.</span></p>

would have to demonstrate that he acted under extreme emotional disturbance and
that the emotional disturbance was subjectively reasonable. I think he defendant would have to present
evidence that in the milieu of the drug dealer, touching someone’s dinner plate
is an incredibly provocative insult. It
would be <i>very</i> hard to put the fact finder in a drug dealer’s shoes. It would be next to impossible to make a
judge or jury sympathetic to the subjective state of mind of the defendant that
would cause him to kill another drug dealer over some money and a plate.</span></span></p>

fearful for his daughter's life, tells Carl to let go of his daughter's hand.

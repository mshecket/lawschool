        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The defendant and victim were in a relationship but had more or less
          broken up. After a lot of rigmarole including some threats, the
          defendant and victim had sex at the defendant�s friend�s house.
          Afterwards, the victim made a complaint to the police.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>There is also evidence that
          their relationship at least partially resumed later. The defendant was
          convicted of second degree rape. He appealed on the basis that there
          was not sufficient evidence to send the case to a jury. He argues that
          there was insufficient evidence to establish the elements of
          <i>force</i> and of the act being
          <i>against the victim�s will</i> that are necessary to establish the
          prima facie case for rape.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Was sufficient evidence presented at trial of the element of
          <i>force</i>?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          If an act of sexual intercourse is by both force and against the
          victim�s will, it constitutes rape even if the victim gave consent to
          the defendant for previous acts of sexual intercourse.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds there is sufficient evidence that the sex was against
          the victim�s <i>will</i>, but it finds insufficient evidence that the
          sex was <i>forced</i>. The court finds that there were acts of force
          and threats of force, but the court considers them <i>unrelated </i>to
          the act of sexual intercourse. The court seems to suggest that it is
          necessary for the victim to resist the act of sexual intercourse in
          order for it to be rape.</span

        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          I think the court overturned the second degree rape conviction.</span

            again, because of the higher standard of proof in criminal cases, it

            As to the second point, we generally do not punish people for their

            characteristics.</span

            <i>equality</i> feminist, and her interest is in showing that men

            look at history, rape was originally a <i>defense</i> to
            fornication/adultery. Having sex against one�s will in effect took
            away the mens rea of adultery. It seems to me that it is a step
            forward that we do not punish men and women for having sex outside
            of marriage.</span

            >Here�s a note about blaming the victim. I think the essential point
            is that just because someone wants to <i>have sex</i> does not mean
            they want to <i>be raped</i>, and these two things are very
            different not only emotionally but physiologically. I do think there
            is an element of imprudence on the part of some victims, but that
            neither mitigates the fault of the perpetrator nor shifts
            substantive blame to the victim. However, from an economic
            standpoint, sometimes the victim is the �cheapest cost avoider�. If,
            for better or worse, women who don�t walk alone at night or who are
            conservatively dressed are less likely to be raped, and rape is bad,
            then it would seem to lead to the conclusion that we want to
            encourage women to dress conservatively and not walk alone at night.
            That doesn�t mean we think women shouldn�t have the right to dress
            how they want and go where they want when they want with who they
            want, but it just reflects the reality of the situation and makes
            the best of it while we work through other means to change it.</span

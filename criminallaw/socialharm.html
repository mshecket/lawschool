<p><span>Dressler,
p. 129-130: <b>Social Harm</b></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
thing that distinguishes crimes from torts is <i>social harm</i>. This harm is clear when someone commits a <i>result
crime</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about conduct crimes? They involve
social harm, in a sense. They may
involve the <i>negation</i> of a <i>social interest</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Some
result and conduct crimes may actually overlap. Also, some crimes require a certain condition (which is not conduct) in
order for the crime to be committed.</span></p>

dir=LTR><span>I think this statute’s
conduct is basically any action at all. The result must be the death of someone. The attendant circumstances would be the presence of “purposefulness”, “knowledge”,
“recklessness” or “negligence”. With
burglary, the conduct is breaking and entering. I don’t think any particular result is set in stone, except perhaps
something in or around the house must be broken, like a lock or a window (but
maybe not). The attendant circumstances
are the fact that the building entered is “a dwelling house”, the fact that it
belongs to “another” (i.e. you can’t burgle yourself), the fact that it’s
nighttime, and the fact that you intend to commit a felony.</span></span></p>

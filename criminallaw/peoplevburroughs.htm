          who tried to heal a guy who had leukemia. The guy died nastily. The
          healer dude was charged with felony practicing medicine without a
          license and felony second degree murder based on the �inherently
          dangerous felony� rule. The trial court instructed the jury that
          practicing medicine without a license is
          <i>as a matter of law</i> �inherently dangerous to human life�. The
          defendant was convicted on both counts. He appealed.</span

        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          In the first step, the court finds that it is possible to practice
          medicine without a license without endangering human life. For
          example, you could treat someone with a very mild ailment in a very
          low-risk way and still technically be found guilty of practicing
          medicine without a license.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In the second step, the court interpreted the statute forbidding the
          unlicensed practice of medicine and found that death was only one
          felonious harm among several that was contemplated. The other harms
          considered in the statute are not necessarily life-threatening.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court reasserts that they don�t like the felony-murder rule and
          they will strive to limit it as much as possible. They also say that
          it is unlikely that the defendant could have been deterred from doing
          what he did by the threat of prosecution for murder.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b

            imprison someone without any risk of killing them (lots and lots of
            Superglue maybe?). Second, the factors elevating false imprisonment
            to a felony are �violence, menace, fraud, <i>or</i> deceit�. If you
            tell someone, �Hey, step on this floor! It�s great!� but you�re
            really getting them to step on super-sticky Superglue in order to
            falsely imprison them, you�re not doing something inherently
            dangerous. So if we note the �or� above, we must find that false
            imprisonment under the statute cited is <i>not</i> inherently

            particular facts, leaving a <i>baby</i>, a <i>newborn</i>, without

            of that baby. The outcome of the case would heavily depend on which
            standard you choose. The statute could have been constructed
            differently such that there was a different (stricter?) standard of
            care for children under three or two or one than for children above

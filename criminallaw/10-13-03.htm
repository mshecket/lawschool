          <i>pure, absolute rule</i>. Any killing that occurs during the
          attempted commission of a felony would trigger this rule. However,
          this rule is controversial, and so courts have tried to find ways to
          limit the rule. These are <i>judge-made limits</i>.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <i><span>What steps does the court take to determine this?</span></i
        ><span>
          The court first looks at the statute and decides
          <i>in the abstract</i> whether this is an inherently dangerous felony.
          Next, the court asks: how dangerous must a felony be in order to be
          inherently dangerous?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <i><span>What is the standard the court uses?</span></i

          The court considers whether an offense may be committed without a

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Courts seem to set a high standard with language like �high
          probability�, but it doesn�t seem like that�s what they mean. They

          The court finds that you can violate the statute without any risk of
          causing death. For example, you could make someone�s mental illness
          worse without killing them.</span

          imprisonment, which is defined as �imprisonment effected by violence,
          menace, fraud, or deceit�. When we look at this statute in the
          abstract, we discover that because it uses its terms in the
          disjunctive (�or�), the crime described <i>can indeed</i> be committed
          without a high risk of causing death. If you falsely imprison someone

        ><span
          >We have <a href="10-3-03.htm">previously</a> discussed arguments in
          favor of the felony-murder rule. What�s the best utilitarian rationale
          for the felony-murder rule? We want to give felons an incentive to
          commit their felonies <i>safely</i>. �Okay, we haven�t deterred you
          from committing this felony, but please try not to cause death while
          you�re committing the felony.� What if this rule actually had this

        <span

      <p>
        <span

          the previously stated justification for this rule (safe felons, safe
          felonies) is the best one, then it makes sense to exempt the
          pickpocket from the felony-murder rule.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Is the result right in <i>Burroughs</i>? Could we really convince
          Burroughs to commit this felony in a safer way? Maybe we could
          persuade Burroughs to stay away from terminally ill patients. Maybe we
          could persuade Burroughs not to advise his patients not to see their
          regular doctor anymore. We can imagine that the felony-murder threat
          could have influenced Burroughs to do what he did in a safer way.
          Dressler thus suggests that this limitation shouldn�t have been
          applied in this case.</span

          very common statute. Once you�ve been convicted of a felony, you
          basically lose the right to possess a concealed firearm. What the
          California Supreme Court said was that white collar felons carrying
          concealed firearms are no more dangerous than just regular folks
          carrying concealed firearms. So their answer was no, carrying a
          concealed firearms is <i>not</i> inherently dangerous because it

          manslaughter is a felony! I�ve just committed a felony, and I�ve
          caused a death during the commission of the felony. Isn�t this felony
          murder? <i>This</i> is why we need the independent felony or merger

          (�A.D.W.�). Why is this a felony for which the felony-murder rule
          cannot apply? The assault is an <i>integral part</i> of the homicide.
          Furthermore, this conduct is <i>included</i> in the homicide. Assault
          with a deadly weapon is not an <i>independent</i> felony. Everything
          has been �used up�, there�s �nothing left�. So in </span

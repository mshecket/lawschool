        <span
          >Look at Model Penal Code � 2.02(9): this codifies, more or less, the
          common law idea that <i>generally</i> knowledge of a law�s existence
          and understanding of its meaning is not a required element of an
          offense, <i>unless</i> the statute itself says to the contrary.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Put this together with � 2.02(1): there must be a <i>mens rea</i> for
          each element of the crime. In a sense, � 2.02(9) makes an exception to
          this general rule.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What are the exceptions? � 2.04(1) says that if the statute
          explicitly says you must know the law to be subject to it, then fine.
          � 2.04(3) further says that you may have a limited defense on the
          basis of your reliance on an <i>official </i>statement of the law from
          an appropriate source. This is a <i>very</i> limited exception,
          though.</span

        <i><span>However</span></i

          >, � 2.04(3) <i>does not</i> permit a defense based on your
          <i>personal</i> misunderstanding of the law. The defendant must
          <i>reasonably</i> rely on an official statement of the law (from an
          appropriate, specified source) that is <i>afterward</i> determined to
          be invalid.</span

        <i><span>Weiss</span></i
        ><span>
          involves a small incident in the Lindbergh kidnapping case.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>X wanted to arrest someone for
          the kidnapping (it turned out it was the wrong person). X needed help
          to make the arrest and Weiss was a private citizen hanging out in the
          area. Officer X says to Weiss, �Help me!� Weiss says �Can I really do
          that?� X gave Weiss a little sheriff�s badge and says �OK, now you�re
          a cop.� Weiss thinks he has authority, but he really doesn�t. Weiss is
          charged with kidnapping (really, being an accomplice).

      <p>

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Cheek was charged with tax evasion and not filing tax returns. The
          <i>mens rea</i> term in the statute is �willfully�. Cheek claimed that
          he didn�t have to pay taxes because �wages� are not �income�, or
          because the Sixteenth Amendment didn�t apply, or some such crap.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In essence, what is Cheek�s claim? Why didn�t he have to pay income
          tax or file reports? Why does he claim that his conviction should be
          overturned? He claims that he acted without the <i>mens rea</i> of
          willfulness.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >According to the trial judge, under what circumstances should Cheek�s
          mistake of law cause him to be acquitted? The judge said that Cheek
          must have an <i>honest</i> and <i>reasonable</i> belief. The jury
          convicted him on this standard.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Cheek claimed that his misunderstanding need only be <i>honest</i>,
          but <i>not necessarily</i> reasonable.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>What�s different between Cheek�s mistake and </span
        ><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt">Marrero</span></st1:place
        ><span
          >�s mistake? Why does the Supreme Court agree with Cheek that he
          should be acquitted even if his mistake was unreasonable? The Court
          says there is a special definition of �willfully� in the context of
          these tax statutes.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >�Willfully� can have many different meanings in different contexts.
          In this case, it means �voluntary, intentional violation of a known
          legal duty�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So why does it follow that if Mr. Cheek honestly believed that he
          didn�t have any taxes to pay, even if that belief was entirely
          unreasonable, that he should be acquitted of the crime? If he didn�t
          believe it was a legal duty, then he didn�t violate a
          <i>known</i> legal duty.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >It can be then argued that this is a <i>specific intent crime</i> in
          the sense of a crime where you must know about an attendant
          circumstance, namely, that Cheek has a legal duty.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Think back to mistake of <i>fact</i>. The first question to ask is
          whether you have a general intent, specific intent, or strict
          liability crime.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This tax statute is a specific intent crime. The next question is
          whether or not the mistake relates to the specific intent portion of
          the specific intent crime. We may conclude that it does. Cheek�s
          mistake relates to whether he did or did not have knowledge of his
          legal duty.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the next question? Does this mistake of fact negate this
          specific intent? Has the prosecutor proven beyond a reasonable doubt
          this element of the crime?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We are <i>not</i> interested in whether or not Cheek is culpable.
          That�s what we do in a general intent case.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The question for the jury is whether or not Cheek violated a
          <i>known</i> legal duty. If he didn�t <i>know</i>, he didn�t violate a
          <i>known</i> legal duty, and thus he must be found not guilty. But the
          question of whether or not he <i>knew</i> is a question of
          <i>fact</i>, and thus a question for the jury, if it had been properly
          instructed in this case.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The conviction was overturned and Cheek was retried. On the second
          trial, a correct instruction was given and the jury convicted him
          again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>This goes to show that
          juries don�t have to believe defendants� claims.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Congress was not so concerned about the Cheek case that they wanted
          to go back and change the statute. How come? Think about the politics.
          Most criminal laws apply only to bad dudes. Tax laws apply to
          everybody. It would be politically unpopular to tighten up tax laws
          and other white collar crime laws.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This is not inconsistent with the Model Penal Code. Look at �
          2.04(1), which tells you that there�s an exception to the �ignorance
          is no excuse� rule when the statute specifically says you must have
          knowledge, recklessness, or negligence in regard to the law.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s pretend we�re Mr. Weiss�s attorney. Why should my client be
          found not guilty of this crime in light of his mistake of law? His
          intent was to cause the person to be confined <i>with</i> authority of
          law, not <i>without </i>authority of law.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s say we�re the prosecutor. What�s our answer to that argument?
          We might argue textually that the phrase �without authority of law�
          was set off by commas, which often means that the preceding word
          �intent� does not apply to that particular phrase.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >At common law, or in other words, if we�re not in a Model Penal Code
          jurisdiction, it�s ambiguous whether a culpability or
          <i>mens rea </i>word modifies everything that comes after or only some
          bits.</span

        <span

          They tried to reform it with the Kennedy-Thurmond (!) Bill of 1968. In
          fact, it would have created an entirely new code and used many
          elements from the Model Penal Code. It was killed in committee by
          prosecutors and federal judges who basically wanted the status quo
          because they already knew how to use it. They didn�t want to have to
          learn anything new. The Washington Post killed the bill again based on
          their cynical belief that � 2.04(3) had been stuck in the bill to get
          Nixon off the hook.

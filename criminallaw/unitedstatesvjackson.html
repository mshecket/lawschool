          >Half an hour after getting out of jail for bank robbery, the
          defendant robbed another bank. He was sentenced to life without parole
          under a statute forbidding career criminals from possessing
          firearms.</span

        ><span> receive?</span>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          The statute does not state a maximum penalty, but it does forbid
          release on parole.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis: </span></b
        ><span
          >The court disposes of the issue of the appeal quickly. Precedent
          states that in the absence of a maximum term of years, the court can
          either impose a ridiculous sentence, like 500 years, or can simply go
          with life. Any sentence that is selected under the statute is
          permissible and cannot be reviewed by the appeals court.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What is interesting in this case, however, are the dicta of
          Easterbrook and Posner.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Easterbrook suggests that the sentence imposed by the trial court is
          not only permissible but just on the basis of general deterrence and
          incapacitation.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Posner concurs, but feels that the sentence was too harsh. He reasons
          that given the hard economic facts of bank robbery, it is highly
          unlikely that a sentence of life in prison will have any greater
          deterrent effect than a sentence of twenty years in prison. He
          suggests the latter sentence will be adequate for the purposes of
          specific deterrence because evidence shows old people don�t commit as
          many crimes.</span

            continue to be an active criminal. I would go for a 30 or 35 year

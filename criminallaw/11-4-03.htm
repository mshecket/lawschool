      <p>
        <span
          >Bentham says that an excuse is a defense when their conduct was
          nondeterrable. The only use for punishment, in a utilitarian view, is
          deterrence. Therefore, if there is no value to punishment and only a
          net social cost, we shouldn�t punish.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Kadish says this is weak. What�s wrong with Bentham�s argument? Say,
          for the sake of argument, there are some people who are genuinely
          undeterrable. Why might there still be some utilitarian value in
          punishing an undeterrable person? There could be a specific deterrence
          or incapacitation justification. If someone is undeterrable, they may
          be said to be dangerous, and thus it�s of value to keep them off the
          street.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the general deterrence value in punishing an undeterrable
          person? If we excuse an undeterrable person, someone else might get
          the wrong message. Someone else might believe that they can convince a
          jury that <i>they</i> are undeterrable. Generally speaking, they may
          be less likely to obey the law because they will perceive it as full
          of holes.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >So there are utilitarian reasons <i>not</i> to recognize excuses.
          Utilitarians have tried to come up with better arguments than
          Bentham�s argument for why we should have excuses. Professor Hart
          argues that excuses confine liability to cases where conduct was
          freely chosen, and therefore people will be happier overall because
          they can avoid punishment by obeying the law. Huh?</span

          utilitarian theory.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Kadish says that Hart misses the point. Kadish says that we have
          excuses because we don�t want to <i>blame</i> those who were not
          <i>responsible</i> for their actions. This is a fundamental point to a
          retributivist: when we punish people, we�re blaming them. The essence
          of criminal law in this country and what makes it different from civil
          law is the blame and condemnation of the community resulting from a
          criminal conviction. To blame someone who is not responsible for his
          actions is a <i>falsehood</i>. It is a matter of justice, Kadish says,
          to excuse certain people even though they have caused some social
          harm.</span

          were not coerced by a person but rather by their physical
          circumstances. Dressler says this is a totally arbitrary distinction.

          limited to physical threats.</span

          the other hand, the court says that duress suggests there was no

      <p>
        <span
          >The Model Penal Code definition of duress is
          <i>revolutionary</i> compared to the common law. It�s different from
          the common law definition in many different ways. Is there a limit
          under Model Penal Code � 3.02 to duress? Yes, the threat listed is
          �unlawful force�. Only humans can do unlawful things. The Model Penal
          Code is like the common law in the fact that it limits the defense of
          duress to human threats. However, under the category of necessity, the
          Model Penal Code would allow either natural <i>or</i> human threats.
          The Model Penal Code is well aware of this. It says that even if �
          3.02 applies, � 2.09 may still apply if you�re dealing with a human

          Dressler suggests that this is a clear case of judicial activism. It

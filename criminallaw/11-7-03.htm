        <span>What should </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Anderson</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span> have been convicted of?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>What�s the policy argument for reducing </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Anderson</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>�s offense to manslaughter.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Some intentional killings, if they are the result of provocation,
          reduce murder to manslaughter. But this isn�t a heat of passion
          case.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>How would we characterize the emotion of </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Anderson</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>? He was in fear.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Adequate provocation makes someone angry which makes them
          intentionally kill. Why does this reduce the level of guilt of an
          actor in the eyes of the law? What explains this? It�s a lot harder to
          control yourself when you�re very angry. When we�ve very angry, our
          self-control is undermined. But we don�t think one�s self-control is
          <i>fully</i> undermined by anger. When you�re angry, you could do a
          lot of things other than kill. You could vent your anger in some other
          way.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why couldn�t you have fear in place of anger in �heat of passion�?
          Fear is an emotion that is like anger in that it makes self-control
          more difficult. We may be able to empathize more with fear than with
          anger.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <st1:City
          ><st1:place

          ></st1:City
        ><span
          >�s point is that if you give a defense for killings caused by
          adequate provocation leading to anger leading to the intent to kill,
          then it follows that you should give a similar defense with fear in
          the place of anger. Dressler seems to argue for just such a partial
          defense.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>The Model Penal Code would actually agree with </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Anderson</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span
          >, although they wouldn�t use duress to get there and they wouldn�t
          use the �heat of passion� excuse. You would go straight to
          manslaughter based on the fact that the homicide was committed under
          �extreme emotional distress�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >As to the hypo in Anderson: the driver who has a gun to his head and
          is told to run red lights and hits and kills someone is said to have
          an �abandoned and malignant heart�. If a gun is put to your head, do
          you really have an �abandoned and malignant heart�? What defense would
          you claim? You could claim necessity, maybe. It�s the imminent death
          of two people versus speeding, which is risky but doesn�t lead to the
          certain death of anybody.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>In the opinion, everyone treated duress as a justification.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Model Penal Code necessity defense allows the intentional killing
          of an innocent person to save a greater number of lives. In a Model
          Penal Code jurisdiction, you could have a complete defense.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But would the person in the hypo act with �extreme indifference to
          the value of human life�? Not really, you would be manifesting
          <i>care</i> about the value of human life. Depraved heart is basically
          extreme recklessness. But what�s recklessness? You must be aware of a
          substantial and unjustifiable risk. Isn�t the risk in the hypo
          justifiable? If you use the Hand formula, you�re making the right
          decision in speeding. Under no circumstances would you be found
          recklessness or negligent. You accidentally killed someone.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So then the defendant is happy! You have a failure of proof
          pseudo-defense. The burden goes back on the prosecutor! It should be
          easy for the defendant to be acquitted. The defendant didn�t have any
          mens rea!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This case has lots of good stuff in it. Dressler says both the
          majority and the dissent are wrong. Dressler says that the majority
          said that duress is a justification, which he says is wrong. The
          dissent comes up with a hypothetical that�s all wrong on its own
          according to Dressler.</span

          mind what �nature and quality� means. For example, a five-year-old
          doesn�t know what killing means exactly. They might not really
          understand death. They get the infancy defense. But maybe some adults

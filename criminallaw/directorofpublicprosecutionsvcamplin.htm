<p><i><span>Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Camplin</span></i><span></span></p>

<p><span>House
of Lords, 1978.</span></p>

<p><span>2
All Eng.Rep. 168, 2 W.L.R. 679.</span></p>

<p><span>Dressler,
pp. 250-254</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The defendant, a
15-year-old, killed a man who had sodomized him and taunted him. His attorney wanted the jury to consider his
response to this provocation against a reasonable boy his age. The trial court said he must be judged
against a reasonable <i>person</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Should the defendant’s
reaction be judged against a reasonable grown-up or a reasonable boy?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> The text of the Homicide
Act refers to the “reasonable man”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The Lords give slightly different
rationales, but come to the same result. Lord Diplock says that a 15-year-old cannot be expected to have the same
measure of self-control as an adult, and thus should not be held to the same
standard.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The Lords vote to dismiss
the appeal.</span></p>

retributivist, I suppose you would believe it is just that each person’s acts
be judged according to their individual capacity for free action and
self-control. However, if you’re a
utilitarian, I think you would be loathe to make those distinctions. </span></span></p>

punishing someone unless they are guilty. There is no situation in which, according to Kant, it is right not to
punish someone who is guilty. No other
concern can be exchanged for justice. For Kant, justice and morality have nothing to do with
consequences. They are <i>moral</i></span><span> (categorical) imperatives.</span></p>

that meting out justice is an absolute imperative which should never compete
with any other interest, then it is our duty to punish the last murderer. Kant would argue strenuously with the notion
that such an action constitutes the infliction of pain for no good reason. The good reason for inflicting pain is to
fulfill society’s duty to seek justice. Kant would also say that hatred has nothing to do with it.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Is
hatred ever justified? Murphy says in
order to answer this question, you must consider cases where someone has been
greatly hurt by a completely unrepentant perpetrator.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Murphy
argues that resentment is essentially an expression of self-respect.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Murphy
further argues that if it is moral to do something, it must be moral to <i>desire
</i>to do that thing. Therefore, if it
is moral to cause pain to someone if you are punishing them, it must be moral
to <i>desire </i>to punish that person.</span></p>

you don’t merely “take them down a notch”, but you also show to the society at

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Common Law is judge-made law  the basis of what we
learn. <i>At common law, there were eight
felonies</i>. <i>Now, virtually anything
is a crime</i>. Almost all states have
abolished common law offenses. The Model
Penal Code says that common law crimes are out the window. That doesn't mean that the common law is

<p>Say some that what makes a crime different from a civil
matter is the <i>condemnation of the community</i>, which is more important
than the <i>punishment</i>. You can have
a heavier punishment for a tort than for a crime, so it's not the punishment
that really distinguishes criminal from civil. It's the community's condemnation of you that makes the
differenceyou're been <i>found guilty</i> of a crime.</p>

<p><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p><i>Utilitarianism and retribution are the most important
tools we will use to study the criminal justice system. </i>We have a duty to be able to explain why
we are punishing people. There are two
questions involved in how we distribute justice: (1) <span class=GramE>Whom</span>
do we punish? (2) How much punishment is
appropriate? <i>How do we distribute
justice on a case-by-case basis?</i></p>

<p><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923245"><b>Utilitarianism</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Utilitarianism is <i>forward-looking</i> and tries to deter
future bad conduct while increasing happiness and reducing pain. Utilitarians believe that <i>both</i> crime <i>and</i>
punishment are evils to be avoided. A
utilitarian <i>doesn't like punishment</i>. Human beings must be characterized by seeking pleasure and avoiding
pain. We must be able to do the
calculations; we must be <i>rational</i>.</p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Forms of
utilitarianism: (1) General deterrence  when you punish one person for a crime
in order to send a message to society. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>(2) Specific deterrence  when you deter
person X by punishing person X: (a) By incapacitation  you keep the person off
the streets or (b) by intimidation  you make the person scared to do it again
because they remember how unpleasant the experience was being punished the
first time. (3) Rehabilitation  when
you use the penal system to change the person such that they won't want to do <span

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923246"><b>Retributivism</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>"The punishment of a wrongdoer is justified because it is a
deserved response to the wrongdoing." You can't be angry at someone unless you believe they have the capacity
to choose to either do right or wrong. Retributivists focus on people having free choice or free will. The retributivist says that it is society's
duty to punish and that this duty is independent of the consequences or costs
or benefits.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Forms of Retributivism: (1) Negative retribution
(utilitarianism*)  utilitarians, except punishing an innocent person is never
justified. (2) Positive retribution  <i>pure</i>
retributivism: you <i>must </i>punish guilty people, and you <i>must </i>never
punish an innocent person. (3) <span
class=SpellE>Assultive</span>  anger and hatred are morally right when
directed at criminals. This is kind of a
disguised utilitarianism: if people hate a criminal, they will institution
private justice. So with the criminal
justice system, we prevent vigilantism. This views a criminal as a worthless human being who deserves what they
get. (4) Protective  Morris, and the
classic modern retributive theory. The
importance of the theory is that it views the criminal as having the right to
be punished. (5) Victim vindication  we
vindicate the victim's moral rights by punishing the perpetrator.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923247"><b>Differences
between the theories</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Utilitarians don't see punishment as inherently good;
retributivists view punishment as inherently good and justifiable because there
is a right and a duty to punish even if it doesn't do any future good. Utilitarians sound like economists trying to
come up with an empirical justification for punishment and talk about
profit. Retributivists think as
moralists do and talk about just deserts. Retributivism makes us look to our moral roots. Actually, some forms of retributivism turn out
to be forms of utilitarianism.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It is plausible to argue as a utilitarian, given a
particular situation, that punishing an innocent person would be the right
thing to do. Is this enough to abandon
utilitarianism? Could a retributivist
punish an innocent person? Categorically: no. You may only
punish a person who is guilty.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Most utilitarians are unhappy with a three strikes law. They might oppose it from an efficiency
standpoint. They might also oppose it
from the point of view that punishment is a social cost.</p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p><i>The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens </i> We will use Dudley
and Stephens as an object lesson for the purpose of general deterrence. Even if Dudley and Stephens aren't <span
class=SpellE>deterrable</span> in their particular case, the utilitarian must
still find they are a useful example to others. This case would send a message to be certain you are prepared when you
go out on a boat because you're going to be held liable for whatever goes on
out there.</p>

<p><i>People v. Superior Court (<span class=SpellE>Du</span>)</i>
 The probation officer said Mrs. <span class=SpellE>Du</span> was unlikely to
commit another crime but recommend she be sentenced to prison. How much punishment is it just for <span
class=SpellE>Du</span> to receive? A
just punishment should: 1) protect society, 2) punish the defendant for
wrongdoing, 3) encourage the defendant to be good in the future, 4) deter other
crimes, 5) incapacitate the defendant, 6) make restitution for the victim, and
7) be comparable to punishments for similar crimes.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A retributivist would say two criminals should get the same
punishment for the same crime. Retributivists
say you must look at the actor as well as the act; you must look at <i>personal
blameworthiness</i> as well as the <i>social harm</i> caused. One controversy is whether a person's
personal character matters or should be considered.</p>

receive? The statute does not state a
maximum penalty, but it does forbid release on parole. Easterbrook says that the sentence imposed by
the trial court is just on the basis of general deterrence and
incapacitation. Posner thinks there's no
chance under the current law to create general deterrence, therefore, he
focuses on specific deterrence. He says
if you keep the guy in jail for 20 more years, he probably won't commit any more
crimes when released.</p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc58923248"><b>The
principle of legality</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The principle of legality is "no crime without <i>preexisting</i>
law". This <i>trumps</i> any other rules
if there is a conflict. Courts don't
create crimes. Statutes must be written
clearly, and interpreted to the benefit of the accused. If you have to rely on a prosecutor or judge
to interpret criminal statutes, you give them enormous power. The Due Process Clause says that potential
criminals must have "fair warning" of what is against the law.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>Commonwealth v. <span class=SpellE>Mochan</span></i> 
The defendant's conduct was not forbidden by any particular statute, but a
general provision in the Pennsylvania Penal Code "grandfathered" in common law
crimes. The defendant was convicted and
appealed on the basis that his conduct did not constitute a common law
crime. The court finds that any act
which "outrages decency and is injurious to public morals" is a misdemeanor
under common law.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>Keeler v. Superior Court </i> The Penal Code further
forbids the courts from convicting or punishing anyone for a crime not
specified by statute. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Statutes are to be
interpreted in the manner most favorable to the defendant. Finally, no one can be convicted of an act
they committed before that act was a crime, in other words, no one may be
punished under <i>ex post facto</i> legislation. The protection of due process is the judicial
analogue of the prohibition on <i>ex post facto</i> laws. It is not the role of the court to make <span
class=GramE>crimes,</span> rather, it is the responsibility of the legislature.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>In Re Banks</i>  In order to be constitutional, a
statute must clearly and "with a reasonable degree of certainty" <span
class=GramE>tell</span> persons who are subject to it what conduct is
forbidden. Banks claims that the
"Peeping Tom" statute is overly broad, and thus it is unconstitutional. He says that some of the conduct prohibited
is entirely innocent.</p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p>The burden is upon the <i>defendant</i> to prove that a
statute is <i>invalid</i>. The court
says that statutes must be <i>strictly construed</i>. This is equivalent to the doctrine of <i>lenity</i>. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
doctrine of lenity </i>says if there are two ways to interpret a statute where
one way would favor the State and one way would favor the accused, the court
must side with the accused. It only
applies when you're right on the razor's edge. In other words, we give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The court says that if a statute is clear, you just do what
it says. If it's ambiguous, you look at
legislative intent: Read the statute
carefully. Read the preamble of the
statute. Read the title. Look at legislative history. Look at common law. Look at precedent cases. <i>It's hard to come up with a statute that
will work! It's hard to avoid vagueness
and <span class=SpellE>overbreadth</span>!</i></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc58923249"><b>Burden
of proof</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two kinds of burdens of proof: (1) Burden of going
forward, or the burden of producing evidence: Who has the responsibility of
putting on evidence in a particular case? The government has the burden of producing evidence regarding any
element of a crime. Anything that
constitutes an element of a crime is something the government must put on
evidence for. On the other hand, for
putting on a certain defense, it's the burden of the <i>defendant</i> to show
evidence of, e.g., self-defense. (2)
Burden of persuasion: Now that the issue is before the factfinder (jury or
judge), who must convince the factfinder in regard to the issue?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Why do we have such a high burden on the government to prove
their case? The theory is that the cost
to society of jailing an innocent person is much higher than releasing a number
of guilty people. <span class=GramE>Also,
protection against overzealous police force, judges, prosecutors.</span> It has less to do with this particular
criminal trial, and more to do with limiting government power in general.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>Owens v. State</i>  "[A] conviction on circumstantial
evidence <i>alone</i> is not to be sustained unless the circumstances are
inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence." The only issue on appeal, as distinguished
from the trial court, is whether a reasonable jury <i>could</i> have convicted,
not whether they <i>would</i> have acquitted or <i>should</i> have
acquitted. The appellate court wasn't
there to see the trial and should not play the role of the "13<sup>th</sup>
juror". The jury sees stuff that the
appellate judge never sees. On appeal,
the presumption of innocence is gone. You assume that all of the facts that are in dispute favor the
prosecution. The appellate court can
overturn the conviction if they think, "How the heck did the jury reach <i>that</i>
verdict?"</p>

tells us that the Constitution requires every prosecutor to persuade the
factfinder beyond a reasonable doubt of every <i>fact</i> (element) necessary
to constitute the crime charged. The
costs to an individual of conviction are so high that they should not be
convicted when there is reasonable doubt of their guilt. The benefit of the standard is that it
assures public confidence in the system, and in particular, the standard
inspires confidence that innocent people don't get convicted. The government doesn't just have to prove the
<span class=GramE>facts,</span> they actually have to <i>negate</i> possible
defenses (excuses, justifications). So,
for example, the <i>absence of</i> self-defense must be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Even though you might have the <i>burden of going forward</i>
as the defendant in presenting evidence that you acted in self-defense, the <i>government</i>
has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant <i>didn't</i>
act in self-defense. But in some
jurisdictions, the defendant has the burden of proof.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We put the right to a jury trial in the Constitution to
prevent judges from oppressing the people. The framers of the Constitution wanted the community to judge the
defendant.</p>

<p>It is often difficult to draw a distinction between the <i>result</i>
of an act and the <i>conduct</i> related to an act, but it usually doesn't
matter. However, you must draw the
distinction between these two elements and <i>attendance circumstance</i>.</p>

<p>The issue with mens rea goes to <i>social harm</i>. Think: "Mens rea = thought about harm, NOT
thought about act".</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We can't deter pure accidents, nor can we find fault for
pure accidents. If you don't have a <i

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Whenever you talk about <i>mens rea</i>, think about whether
you mean the "culpability" meaning or the "elemental" meaning. The culpability meaning is the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>broad</i> meaning that just means "evil
mind", more or less. When a person is
doing something he shouldn't be doing and causes a certain social harm, we can
say they did that act in a morally culpable manner. The "elemental" meaning is "the particular
mental state required by the definition of a particular offense". The elemental approach requires a more
precise analysis than the culpability approach.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Common law talks about the transferred intent doctrine,
which says that "intent follows the bullet". If you had intent, but hit the wrong person, you still have the mens rea
necessary to constitute the crime. Model
Penal Code § 2.03(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)  your mens rea is purposely
or knowingly if you cause a result that differs from the intended result only
by who or what is affected.</p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc58923258"><b>General
versus specific intent</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are at least three different definitions of general
and specific intent. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Specific intent can
mean the requirement of: (1) intent to commit a future act, (2) proof of a
special motive, or (3) proof of the actor's awareness of an attendant
circumstance.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Today, as a general matter, we include <i>mens rea</i> words
in most statutes.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>"General intent" may refer to an offense for which no
particular mental state is mentioned in the statute. "Specific intent", on the other hand, could
refer to an offense that sets out a particular mental state as part of the
crime. </p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>"General intent" may mean any mental state that only relates
to the acts that constitute a crime, whereas "specific intent" would mean, in
this case, a special mental element above and beyond the "general intent". When you have a specific intent crime, there
are typically three types: (1) intent to commit a future act, (2) proof of a
special motive, and (3) proof of awareness of attendant circumstances.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If an offense requires a culpable mental state but isn't a
specific intent crime, then it's a general intent crime.</p>

<p>Dressler says that "P, K, R, N" is a <i>continuum </i>of
culpability. There must be <span
class=GramE>either P</span>, K, R, or N with respect to <i>each</i> material
element of an offense. This provision
effectively means that the Model Penal Code applies an <i>elemental </i>approach
rather than a <i>culpability</i> approach to <i>mens rea</i>. You must show a <i>particular</i> state of
mind, not just any bad or immoral state of mind. When there is no specific kind of culpability
given, you assume "P, K, or R". The
Model Penal Code drafters don't like the idea of ever punishing a person whose
culpability is mere negligence. If a
legislature wants to punish a negligent person, they have to be totally
explicit about it.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>State v. Nations </i> In <st1:State><st1:place>Missouri</st1:place></st1:State>,
the Criminal Code dictates that in order to prove that someone did something
with <span class=GramE>knowledge,</span> you must show that they were aware of
the attendant circumstances necessary to constitute an offense. Nations claims the defense that the state
must prove that she <i>knew</i> the girl was underage. In <st1:State><st1:place>Missouri</st1:place></st1:State>,
knowledge means <i>awareness</i> of facts; here we're talking about knowledge
of an attendant circumstance. This is
not the Model Penal Code formulation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What argument can be put forward against this "<span
class=SpellE>wilful</span> blindness" provision? It blurs the line between knowledge and
recklessness. What is the mental state
of a person who is aware of a high probability that, for example, a female
dancer is under the age of 17? Isn't
that very similar to the definition of recklessness, which talks about
disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk? Many critics say this provision is no good
because it defies understanding what it means to "know" something when in fact
you <i>don't </i>know it.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you require <i>actual</i> knowledge,
as in <st1:State><st1:place>Missouri</st1:place></st1:State>, it will be harder
to get convictions in cases like this. We could attack <span class=GramE>this</span> two ways: we could knock
down the standard of culpability in the statute to recklessness, or else you
can, by statute, ratchet up the mental state of "<span class=SpellE>wilful</span>
blindness" to knowledge, as the Model Penal Code does.</p>

<p><i>People v. Navarro</i>  A good faith mistake is a defense
when it negates a required <i>mens rea</i> of the crime. Specific intent is negated by mere good faith
mistake, and reasonableness is not needed.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If the belief was unreasonable, did he act in a morally
culpable manner? We would more or less
be saying he was negligent. There would
be a <i>mens rea</i>, and thus <i>some</i> level of culpability. Why did the court reverse the verdict? He lacked the specific intent required for
the crime. Moral culpability is general
intent.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What would Model Penal Code § 2.04 say about this case? It says either the mistake does or does not
negate the required <i>mens rea</i> for the crime. If the <i>mens rea</i> is the "intent" or
"purpose" to steal, and the mistake proves that the defendant did not have such
a purpose, then the defendant must be acquitted. The Model Penal Code rules!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>"Mistake of fact" is not a true affirmative defense. It is really a challenge to proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of <i>mens rea</i>. The
first thing to do when you're in a non-Model Penal Code jurisdiction is to ask:
is it a general intent, specific intent, or strict liability crime? If it's strict liability, you're done. Intent doesn't matter, and thus mistake
doesn't matter. If you have a specific
intent crime, you ask if the mistake relates to the specific intent portion of
the crime. If you have a general intent
crime, then at common law you must apply a "culpability" analysis. You must ask whether the defendant's state of
mind was blameworthy, and in particular you must ask whether or not their
mistake, and in turn their behavior, was reasonable. In the Model Penal Code, you <i>always</i>
apply "elemental" analysis.</p>

"moral wrong" doctrine</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When you use the "moral wrong" doctrine, you look at the
world through the eyes of the defendant and assume the facts as the defendant
himself understood them. This doctrine
says that if the defendant acted immorally, it is reasonable for him to assume
the risk that the circumstances are different from what he thinks they are and
thus be found guilty of some crime. Here, we end up asking: are you a bad guy? The answer turns out to be yes, even though
there is a reasonable mistake of fact. Many jurisdictions do not apply this doctrine anymore. It is a position that some jurisdictions
still do use.</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>immoral </i>even though it's not
illegal. The other problem is the
principle of legality. If it's so wrong
to take an 18-year-old away from her parents, make it a crime! There's a lack of notice and the risk of the
court creating crimes. We do not live in
a world where everything that is immoral is illegal. There are lots of things that people do that
are immoral that are not a crime. It is
up to the legislature to draw a line between the illegal and the merely
immoral.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The "legal wrong" doctrine is basically the "moral wrong"
doctrine with the word "legally" substituted for the word "morally". Under common law doctrine, the defendant
would assume the risk that the facts were not as he believed them to be, and be
found guilty of a more serious crime. It
can be argued that this is unjust, because he may be convicted of a crime that
requires a higher <i>mens rea</i> than he has. Under the Model Penal Code, he will be convicted of the lesser crime.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It's crucial at common law to distinguish between general
intent, specific intent, and strict liability. However, sometimes courts will fall back on the "moral wrong" or "legal
wrong" doctrines when dealing with a general intent crime committed under a
reasonable mistake of fact.</p>

<p>Look at Model Penal Code § 2.02(9): this codifies, more or
less, the common law idea that <i>generally</i> knowledge of a law's existence

<p><i>People v. </i><st1:place><i>Marrero</i></st1:place> 
Mistake to law may negate intent but it is not a defense to a strict liability

<p>The common law says that "Ignorance of the law is no
defense." The utilitarian rationale for
such a harsh rule is that admitting the excuse of mistake of law encourages
ignorance of the law. This is a classic
utilitarian statement. We're willing to
concede that this individual does not deserve punishment, yet our interest in
persuading people to learn the law outweighs that individual's interests. On the other hand, if ignorance will never
get us off, we have no incentive to learn the law. However, if we make a reasonable effort to
learn the law and are thus given a defense, we have a good incentive.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Retributivists say we mustn't punish someone whose mistake
of law is reasonable, because that person is not blameworthy.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Basically, we <i>do not give people a defense</i> from a
mistake of law, <i>except</i> for very few special cases where they made a <i>reasonable</i>
mistake based on an <i>official</i> statement of the law. The Model Penal Code approach: § 2.02(9) <span
class=GramE>does</span> not ordinarily require proof that a defendant knew that
a law existed or understood it. §
2.04(1) creates the exception that if the definition of the crime itself
requires knowledge of the law and you didn't know it, then you lack one of the
necessary elements for the offense. §
2.04(3) <span class=GramE>provides</span> a limited set of circumstances in
which even though knowledge of the law isn't an element of the crime, we allow
a defense. We don't allow a defense
based on a <i>personal</i> misunderstanding of the law, but rather a reasonable
reliance on an official statement of the law from a public official or some
other source. A casual or unofficial
interpretation of the law from a public official is no good.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Put this together with § 2.02(1): there must be a <i>mens
rea</i> for each element of the crime. In a sense, § 2.02(9) makes an exception to this general rule.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In short, <i>you don't have to prove that the defendant
understood the law</i>, usually.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What are the exceptions? § 2.04(1) says that if the statute explicitly says you must know the law
to be subject to it, then fine. §
2.04(3) further <span class=GramE>says</span> that you may have a limited
defense on the basis of your reliance on an <i>official </i>statement of the
law from an appropriate source. This is
a <i>very</i> limited exception, though. <i>However</i>, § 2.04(3) <i>does not</i> permit a defense based on your
<i>personal</i> misunderstanding of the law. The defendant must <i>reasonably</i> rely on an official statement of
the law (from an appropriate, specified source) that is <i>afterward</i>
determined to be invalid. Note that in
these areas, the Model Penal Code is more or less a restatement of common law.</p>

<p>Look at § 2.04(1), which tells you that there's an exception

<p><i>Velazquez v. State</i>  Courts usually use the "but for"

result if it wouldn't have happened if it weren't for their action. Sometimes, courts substitute the "but for"
test with the "substantial factor" test when two or more defendants did the
same thing at the same time causing the intended result. Finally, some crimes have a "proximate cause"
element that is wider than "but for" test. Basically, courts won't find defendants guilty if the result of their
conduct was unforeseeable or when it just wouldn't be fair to find them guilty.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>With actual causation, we create a "line-up" of all the

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There is <i>no categorical rule</i> that answers these
questions. Now we're in the area of
deciding what is <i>just</i> and <i>fair</i>. Whenever you think about a proximate cause question, think about a line
going from the act of the defendant and the social harm. Then you look to see if there were any other
"but for" causes that occurred between the time of the voluntary act and the
time of the social harm. If there is
nothing that comes between the act and the harm, then it is a case of "direct
harm". That's an easy case; the
defendant is in the actual cause "lineup" by himself. Often, however, there will be some
"intervening cause" that comes between the act and the harm. Now we have a serious proximate causation
issue because we must decide who we want to hold responsible.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><i>Kibbe</i></span><i> v. </i><st1:City><st1:place><i>Henderson</i></st1:place></st1:City>
 By statute, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant
<i>caused</i> the victim's death. In
this case, we have a number of intervening causes. We are forced to decide whether or not we
should hold the defendant accountable for the death, even though he didn't want
to kill the victim. If we don't blame
the defendant for the death of the victim, who do we blame?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The real issue is a policy issue. Is it just to hold someone responsible for <span
class=GramE>a harm</span> given the way in which it happened? In other words, the Model Penal Code is
getting away from all the complicated tests from common law and is suggesting
that we give the jury the basic question of whether the result is just.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>That's not to say that the common law rules and doctrines
are no longer relevant. As an attorney,
you will want to use them for the purposes of arguing justice to the jury.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>There is no black letter rule for judging proximate cause</i>. However, there are a number of tests and
standards for proximate cause.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Coincidental and responsible intervening
causes</span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>  </span>An intervening
act is a coincidence when the defendant's act just put the victim in the wrong
place at the wrong time, in which case the defendant is not the proximate cause
unless the result was foreseeable. On
the other hand, an intervening act is a response when the act is a reaction to
the conditions made by the defendant for the victim, in which case the
defendant is the proximate cause unless the intervening cause is unforeseeable
and very highly unlikely, bizarre, and abnormal.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The intended consequences doctrine</span> </i>
Based on the intended consequences doctrine, we reach back to the person who
intended to cause the harm to find the proximate cause of the harm. In other words, the mother got what she <span
class=GramE>wanted,</span> though not the way she wanted. We will probably hold her to be the proximate
cause of the death. However, we must say
"probably" because this is just one way to look at proximate causation.<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The apparent safety
doctrine </i> The "apparent safety" doctrine says that once the danger from
the defendant is no longer present, we no longer consider that defendant a
proximate cause. The question is: did
the victim reach "apparent safety"? Since she could have easily gotten into the house, we would assign
proximate cause for her death to her based on this doctrine.</p>

<p><i>Murder is the killing of a human being by another human
being with malice aforethought.</i></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>The distinctions that exist at common law and in the Model
Penal Code as well as the various non-Model Penal Code homicide statutes
between murder and manslaughter as well as between degrees of these crimes are
all functions of <i>mens rea</i>. The
act is always the same: killing somebody. It's just the mental state that changes. Everything that we'll be covering in the remainder of this chapter will
deal with mens rea.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>What's murder at common law? </i>It's<i> </i>"the unlawful killing of
another human being with malice aforethought'". <i>There are no degrees of murder at common
law! Know this for the exam! </i>"Degrees" of murder are purely <i>statutory</i>. At common law, all felonies carried the death
penalty. States decided that not all
felonies deserve the death penalty. When
we're talking about <i>degrees</i> of a felony, we're talking about <i>statutes</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>What's the common law definition of manslaughter?</i> It's the unlawful killing of another human
being <i>without</i> "malice aforethought". Notice that in this case, there are <i>lawful</i> killings of other
human beings <i>without</i> malice aforethought, such as killing in
self-defense.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At <i>American</i> common law, there are really two kinds of
manslaughter: so-called <i>voluntary</i> and <i>involuntary</i>
manslaughter. These distinctions existed
in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region> by
statute, but here it's a common law concept.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923268"><b>"Malice
aforethought"</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>What is "malice aforethought" at common law?</i> It is either (1) the intent to kill, (2)
intent to cause grave bodily harm, (3) recklessness (depraved heart), or (4)
the intent to commit a felony (felony-murder rule). There must <i>not</i> be a justification, an
excuse or any mitigating factor. <i>How
did we define acting with "malice" earlier in the semester?</i> It means acting "intentionally [purposefully
or knowingly] or recklessly". "Aforethought" doesn't really mean anything anymore.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>State v. Schrader</i>  On appeal the defendant says that
for a killing to be <span class=GramE>premeditated,</span> there must be intent
to kill for some finite period of time before the act occurs. This is incorrect according to the
interpretation of the statute in the state at the time: no time is too short
for someone to form the intent to commit murder.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>An <i>intentional</i> killing that is <i>not</i> "<i>premeditated
and deliberate</i>" would be second degree murder.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923269"><b>Model
Penal Code on criminal homicide</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the Model Penal Code, there are no <i>degrees of murder</i>,
but there are <i>degrees of felonies</i>. Murder is a felony of the first degree in the Model Penal Code. That's not the same thing as murder in the
first degree. Murder is a felony of the
first degree, just like rape and some other crimes. At common law, murder is murder and that's
how it is in the Model Penal Code.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Model Penal Code doesn't contain a requirement of
"malice aforethought" or the word "unlawful". We just have PKRN. The Model Penal
Code is, in a sense, a return to the common law.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The standard for determining premeditation is whether the
defendant had time to take a "second look" before acting. Deliberation involves "weighing" the
issue. Premeditation is <i>how long </i>you
think about your act. You could
premeditate without meeting the deliberation requirement.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><i>Midgett</i></span><i> and Forrest</i>
 If these two cases are rightly decided, we find that <span class=SpellE>Midgett</span>
committed second degree murder, while Forrest committed first degree
murder. Have we come up with a
meaningful way to distinguish first and second degree murder? Does the "willful, deliberate and
premeditated" distinction do the work we want it to do? Is the Model Penal Code right that we
shouldn't have degrees of murder?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc58923270"><b>Adequate
provocation</b></a></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p>Here are the requirements for mitigation from murder to
manslaughter: (1) Adequate provocation, (2) heat of passion, (3) lack of
opportunity for the passion to <span class=GramE>cool, and (4) causal</span>
connection between provocation, passion, and act. At common law, words alone never constitute
adequate provocation.</p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><i>Girouard v. State</i>  Words can only constitute
adequate provocation to mitigate if they are accompanied by the threat of
bodily harm. The reason for this rule is
that as a matter of social policy, we don't want domestic disputes to end in
the killing of a spouse. Strictly
speaking, in <i>Girouard</i>, the provocation is <i>not</i> words alone because
the victim jumped on the defendant and pulled his hair. But at common law, words alone are <i>never</i>
adequate provocation to partially justify or partially excuse homicide.</p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc58923271"><b>The
reasonable man</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>To what extent should we "<span class=SpellE>subjectivize</span>"
the "reasonable man" standard? It is
argued that if you include some subjective characteristics, you must include
all characteristics. There are several
ways we might want to bring a defendant's characteristics into the "reasonable
man" standard: (1) <span class=GramE>Was</span> the defendant really provoked
to lose self-control? (2) Was the
provocation severe to a reasonable person? (3) How much self-control is expected of the reasonable person?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. <span class=SpellE>Camplin</span></i>
 Should the defendant's reaction be judged against a reasonable grown-up or a
reasonable boy? The text of the Homicide
Act refers to the "reasonable man". Should we include the defendant's age in the description of the
"reasonable man" we will compare him to? Why should gender count? Should
women be held to a "reasonable woman" standard? That's a higher standard than "reasonable (male, manly) man" or
"reasonable person).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>People v. <span class=SpellE>Casassa</span> </i> In a
bench trial, the defendant argued the partial excuse of extreme emotional
distress. The judge found him guilty of
murder. The defendant appealed on the
basis that he wasn't allowed the extreme emotional disturbance defense.<i></i></p>

<p><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p>The Model Penal Code standard for extreme emotional distress
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>more subjective</i> than the common
law standard. The Model Penal Code does
not talk about "adequate provocation". Instead, it only talks about extreme mental or emotional disturbance. The Model Penal Code has both an objective
and a subjective test for the reasonableness of the extreme emotional
disturbance that is put forward as a partial excuse. The word "situation" in
the Model Penal Code section on manslaughter is ambiguous by design. It's your role as an attorney to make the
argument why a jury should come out a certain way. The Model Penal Code claims that the bottom
line is whether the jury can be sympathetic to a defendant in a particular
case.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The defendant must show that he has a <i>reasonable</i>
reason for being in the condition he was in. If the judge finds that there was extreme emotional disturbance, then
the jury would decide whether or not that disturbance was reasonable.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923272"><b>Depraved-heart
murder</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We will consider cases where the defendant does not <i>intend</i>
to kill, but may still be found guilty of murder. The defendant takes an <i>unjustified risk</i>. If we have a continuum of risk-taking, there
will be some risk-taking that is entirely innocent at one end. Further down the line, there is risk-taking
that might constitute negligence at a tort level, followed by risk-taking that
might constitute negligence in criminal law. Finally, at the other end of the spectrum we'll have recklessness, and in
some jurisdictions even <i>extreme</i> recklessness.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>These cases talk about <i>express</i> and <i>implied</i>
malice. At common law, when the court
talks about express malice it is talking about <i>intent to kill</i>. Implied malice suggests any of the other
three formulations of malice.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>Berry v. Superior Court</i>  In <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>,
the defendant must be shown to have had <span class=GramE>a knowledge</span> of
the "high degree of risk", or in other words, they must be shown to be <i>reckless</i>,
in order to be charged with murder as opposed to manslaughter. No one claims that there was intent to kill. <st1:State><st1:place>Berry</st1:place></st1:State>
took an unjustifiable risk. The expected
harm (<span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>pL</span></span>) exceeded the
benefit of keeping the dog in the neighborhood (B). A reasonable person would not take such a
risk. If the reason for taking the risk
is socially useless or unacceptable, then <i>any</i> risk is unjustifiable.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the Model Penal Code, both the definitions of both
recklessness and negligence include a "substantial and unjustifiable
risk". If you take this literally, then
you could get into a strange situation: if a tiny risk is unjustifiable but not
substantial, you might not be found culpable. But another way to view this is to look at it as a "<i>substantially </i>unjustifiable
risk". Extreme recklessness will be
murder at common law or under the Model Penal Code.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>State v. Hernandez</i>  Evidence is admissible so long
as it goes to show that the defendant had the mens rea necessary for the
particular offense charged. The
defendant argues that the evidence in dispute speaks only to his character
rather than his awareness of risk. His
awareness of risk was not at issue because the prosecution charged him with a
crime that does not require such awareness.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At common law, when someone is found to be reckless, they
possess malice and thus they have committed murder. If they are criminally negligent, they have
committed involuntary manslaughter. If
they don't meet criminal negligence, they will not be criminally liable. However, under the Model Penal Code, if
someone commits homicide recklessly, it could be either murder or
manslaughter. Manslaughter is a reckless
killing, while murder can be a "reckless plus" killing. If the person killed negligently, they can be
charged with <i>negligent homicide</i>, which isn't even in common law.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Model Penal Code says that when negligence is sufficient
to establish an element of an offense, that element is <i>also</i> satisfied by
acting purposely, knowingly, or recklessly. The Model Penal Code has a <i>continuum of culpability</i>. The Model Penal Code says that if a person is
charged with negligence and the prosecutor is able to prove purposefulness,
knowledge, or recklessness, it does not preclude the prosecutor from convicting
for negligence. This seems quite
logical. Let's say a person is charged
with negligent homicide. The defendant
could go on the witness stand and make an argument that he <i>intended to kill</i>. Then, absent this rule from the Model Penal
Code, we might be led to believe that we must acquit the defendant of negligent
homicide.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>State v. Williams</i>  In <st1:State><st1:place>Washington</st1:place></st1:State>,
manslaughter is any homicide committed with <i>simple</i> (as opposed to <i>gross</i>)
negligence. Furthermore, homicide is
excusable if it is committed accidentally while "doing any lawful act by lawful
means, with ordinary caution". The
standard of negligence that had to be proven in this case was <i>civil</i> negligence,
or in other words, <i>tort-level</i> negligence, not <i>gross</i> negligence.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Model Penal Code does not look kindly upon punishment of
negligence. Is there any basis for ever
punishing a person who is <i>incapable</i> of living up to the established,
objective standard? It's hard to blame
someone who is not capable of being otherwise, but on the other hand, from a
utilitarian perspective, we may want to keep these people off the street.</p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923273"><b>The
felony-murder rule</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It can be argued that felony murder is a strict liability
crime. 99% of cases of real world felony
murder do not require the felony-murder rule to convict. Usually, you can show a depraved heart. Usually, when a prosecutor uses the
felony-murder rule, they already have intent to kill or depraved heart.</p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><i>People v. Fuller</i>  Under <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
law, all murder that is committed while committing another felony is considered
first degree murder. Consider the
rationale that the felony-murder rule will help deter the underlying felony. This seems totally bogus, because why don't
you just up the penalty for that felony? Let's say, on the other hand, we can't deter felons. Maybe we can get the felon to at least commit
their felony in a way that reduces the risk that human life will be taken in
the process. Maybe, for example, this
will give the escapee an incentive to escape safely. Dressler believes that this is the <i>best </i>utilitarian
argument for the felony-murder rule. He
doesn't necessarily think it's correct. He says it is subject to empirical analysis.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At common law, the felony-murder rule is a <i>pure, absolute
rule</i>. Any killing that occurs during
the attempted commission of a felony would trigger this rule. However, this rule is controversial, and so
courts have tried to find ways to limit the rule. These are <i>judge-made limits</i>. Some jurisdictions keep the common law
rule. Other jurisdictions have imposed
certain limitations on the rule. <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
was a leading state in trying to limit the felony-murder rule at the time these
two cases were decided.</p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:3'><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><i>People v. Burroughs</i>  To determine whether the
felony-murder rule should apply in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>,
you must use a two step process: (1) Does the <i>primary element </i>of the
offense <i>necessarily</i> involve danger to human life? (2) Do the <i>factors elevating the offense
to a felony </i>render that offense dangerous to human life? There are two alternative "inherently
dangerous" standards: a felony is considered inherently dangerous if (1) it is
"dangerous in the abstract" or (2) it is dangerous based on the facts of the
case.</p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p><i>Does this limitation make sense? </i>We have previously discussed arguments in
favor of the felony-murder rule. What's
the best utilitarian rationale for the felony-murder rule? We want to give felons an incentive to commit
their felonies <i>safely</i>. Let's say
someone commits felony <span class=SpellE>pickpocketing</span>. Under this limitation, we wouldn't apply the
felony-murder rule to <span class=SpellE>pickpocketing</span>. Dressler says if we accept the felony-murder
rule, and we accept that the previously stated justification for this rule
(safe felons, safe felonies) is the best one, then it makes sense to exempt the
pickpocket from the felony-murder rule.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Is possession of a concealed firearm inherently
dangerous? This is a very common
statute. Once you've been convicted of a
felony, you basically lose the right to possess a concealed firearm. What the California Supreme Court said was
that white collar felons carrying concealed firearms are no more dangerous than
just regular folks carrying concealed firearms. So their answer was no, carrying a concealed firearms is <i>not</i>
inherently dangerous because it <i>could</i> be done in a matter no more
dangerous than the average <span class=SpellE>schmoe</span> carrying around a
firearm.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>How does the court cut off the felony-murder theory?</i> The court finds that practicing medicine
without a license is not "<i>inherently dangerous</i>". (1) The court looks at the statute and
decides <i>in the abstract</i> whether this is an inherently dangerous
felony. (2) The court asks: how dangerous
must a felony be in order to be inherently dangerous?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>What is the standard the court uses?</i> The court considers whether an offense may be
committed without a "high probability" of loss of life. The court finds that you can violate the
statute without any risk of causing death. For example, you could make someone's mental illness worse without
killing them.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>As long as you can imagine a way that a crime can be

<p><i>People v. Smith </i> In <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>,
the felony murder rule is "inapplicable to felonies that are an integral part
ofthe homicide". In such cases, the
latter felony must be "merged" into the homicide and murder must be proven by
one of the other three types of "malice".<i></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If a state uses both rules, there is sort of a "ceiling" and
a "floor". Felonies that aren't
inherently dangerous can't get a felony-murder conviction, but felonies that
are, in a sense, <i>too</i> dangerous won't support a felony-murder conviction
either because they will merge. The only
type of felony that remains is one where it was something inherently dangerous,
yet it wasn't integral to the homicide.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The California Supreme Court adds a caveat: if a felony has
an "independent felonious purpose", it can be used with the felony-murder
rule. Note that this independent purpose
must be <i>felonious</i>. Discipline of

victim gave consent to the defendant for previous acts of sexual
intercourse. The court finds there is
sufficient evidence that the sex was against the victim's <i>will</i>, but it
finds insufficient evidence that the sex was <i>forced</i>. The court finds that there were acts of force
and threats of force, but the court considers them <i>unrelated </i>to the act
of sexual intercourse. The court seems
to suggest that it is necessary for the victim to resist the act of sexual
intercourse in order for it to be rape.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This case, according to Dressler, represents the most <i>traditional</i>
case of rape. We'll go from here and see
how there has been movement over time.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>North Carolina</st1:place></st1:State>,
second degree rape involved: Vaginal intercourse, with force, against the
victim's will, without the victim's consent.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here are some issues to keep in mind: Keep in mind the potential
distinction between force and the <i>threat</i> of force. In some statutes, force is required, while in
others, only the <i>threat</i> of force is required. This court says that there may be <i>non-consensual
sex that is not rape</i>.</p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p><i>Was the court right in saying that there was insufficient
evidence to show force or the threat of force?</i> What facts might the prosecutor point to that
would prove that the defendant forced the victim to have sex?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>State v. Rusk </i> Was the Court of Special Appeals
correct in reversing Rusk's conviction? In particular, was the reasonableness of the victim's apprehension of
fear a question of fact or a question of law?<i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span></i>Is the evidence in the record of the
case sufficient for a finder of fact to conclude that the act of intercourse in
this case was accompanied by "force or threats of force" and to thus find Rusk
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of second degree rape? Under the Maryland statute at the time, the
offense of second degree rape is defined as vaginal intercourse accomplished by
force or threat of force against the will and without the consent of the other
person.</p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923277"><b>The
resistance requirement</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If there is a resistance requirement, then we are in some
sense trying the woman and asking if she resisted adequately. In the traditional law, you can have force <i>with</i>
consent.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Some courts argue that resistance is part of force. Other courts interpret the "against the will"
part to suggest there must be some kind of physical battle going on. "Requiring" the woman to resist for there to
be a successful rape prosecution may actually increase the risk of physical
harm to the woman. Maybe we need to
provide notice to the man that the woman is not consenting. Resistance could be conceived of as a form of
notice. Also, we'll need to prove a mens
rea of rape, though it is a general intent crime. A reasonable mistake of fact would be a
defense to rape. If the woman resists,
and the man proceeds anyway, it vitiates his possible defense of reasonable
mistake of fact.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Another argument out of the common law is that if a woman is
"what a woman is supposed to be" that the only natural thing for the woman to
do is to protect her "virtue". Therefore, the argument goes, if she doesn't care enough about her "virtue"
to protect it, then why should we? <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This
probably stinks to us now.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Coughlin tried to explain the law of rape in terms of the
Victorian period and the use of rape as a defense to adultery. All forms of fornication (sex outside of
marriage) were considered immoral. So if
the woman resists, it shows that she was an unwilling participant in something
that was considered a crime on the part of both parties.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc58923278"><b>The
common law rule of resistance</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><i>If the man used force likely to cause death or serious
bodily injury, the law at common law did not require the woman to resist.</i> <i>If the man used less force, then the woman
was required to resist. </i><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>At common
law, the woman had to resist to the utmost to fight the man off. But if the woman has to resist, one of two
things happens: (1) the man stops, or (2) the man overcomes her resistance,
which constitutes the force necessary to the offense at common law.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If we take away the resistance requirement, how much force
is needed? <span class=GramE>Is</span>
the sexual act itself the force? If
there is a genuine resistance requirement in the law, it is much easier to
determine by law if a rape has occurred. If we remove the resistance requirement, it will be a lot harder to tell
whether rape has occurred.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Maximalist</span>  anything that is
immoral should be criminal. Minimalist 
not everything that is immoral should be criminal; only the worst acts should
be criminal. Every year, the Penal Code
gets thicker. We seem to be moving away
from a minimalist approach. But no one
would suggest that we're approaching a <span class=SpellE>maximalist</span>
approach. Dressler proposes that most
people aren't going to be upset by this. We all sometimes do things that are immoral. In this country, we do not treat morality and
criminal law as exactly the same. In
certain theocratic countries, it might be different. In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we don't punish people for being
less than perfectly virtuous.</p>

<p><i>Commonwealth v. Berkowitz </i> Under the <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>

the part of the defendant? <span
class=GramE>Under the rule of </span><st1:place><span class=GramE><i>Rhodes</i></span></st1:place><span
class=GramE>, the judgment of whether forcible compulsion or the threat of
forcible compulsion occurred is to be judged on the "totality of the
circumstances".</span><i> </i>No matter
what the victim may have meant by "no", there is the mens rea question of what
the defendant understood by her saying "no".<i> </i>A reasonable mistake of fact is normally a defense to a general
intent crime. Rape is a general intent
crime.<i></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Model Penal Code provides for a lesser offense related
to rape called "gross sexual imposition". <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Might that apply in <i>Berkowitz</i>? The thing is that this offense requires a
threat rather than actual force.</p>

<p><i>State of </i><st1:State><st1:place><i>New Jersey</i></st1:place></st1:State><i>
in the Interest of M.T.S. </i> Is any force required besides the force of
sexual intercourse itself to find the defendant delinquent for second-degree
sexual assault? NEW RULE! "[A]<span class=SpellE>ny</span> act of
sexual penetration engaged inwithout the <i>affirmative</i> and <i>freely-given</i>
<i>permission</i> of the victimconstitutes the offense of sexual assault. Therefore, physical force in excess of that
inherent in the act of sexual penetration is <i>not required</i> for such
penetration to be unlawful." The court
focuses on the defendant's conduct and rejects any judgment passed upon the
victim except as it pertains to the actions of the defendant. <i>If you don't get permission, it's sexual
assault.</i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If the evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the
defendant <i>knew </i>that the sexual penetration was accomplished without
freely given affirmative permission, then the defendant should be found
guilty. If the evidence shows beyond a
reasonable doubt that the defendant <i>believed</i> that the sexual penetration
was accomplished <i>with</i> freely given permission, then the factfinder must
consider whether, given the totality of the evidence, that belief was <i>reasonable</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>So what is the new rule of sexual assault in </i><st1:State><st1:place><i>New
  Jersey</i></st1:place></st1:State><i>?</i> In other words, <i>if I'm going to have sex, how can I make sure I won't
be prosecuted?</i> The court says that
you must get "freely given affirmative permission" to engage in the sexual
penetration. Unless a party gets such
permission, the mere act of sexual penetration constitutes the force required
under the definition of the crime.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Does "without consent" necessarily mean "against one's <span
class=GramE>will</span>"? When we ask
whether something was done without consent, aren't we inquiring into an
internal state of mind of the alleged victim? Dressler says that permission is an "externalized" form of consent. In <st1:State><st1:place>New Jersey</st1:place></st1:State>,
permission can only be given by <i>acts</i> or <i>statements</i>. Permission cannot be given by <i>omission</i>. Permission must be <i>externalized</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>Is this a good way to define criminal sexual assault? </i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>How could the defendant prove that the alleged
victim gave permission? Imagine how
humiliating the trial has just become! But how else can the defendant defend himself? This sends a message to women about whether
they want to bring charges. The Kobe
Bryant case shows just how embarrassing a rape prosecution can be to a
woman. <i>M.T.S. </i>stands alone. We don't know what it means, and we don't
know what other states might argue it.</p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923279"><b>The mens
rea of rape and mistake of fact</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The issue of mens rea in the area of rape is almost always
whether the man believed that the female was consenting to sexual
intercourse. This is mistake of fact,
which we've already covered.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Rape is a general intent offense. Thus, we apply a culpability analysis and ask
whether the defendant's mistake of fact was reasonable. If the defendant's mistake of fact was
unreasonable, we are clear to convict.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>MacKinnon thinks the mistake of fact defense is <span
class=SpellE><i>stuuuuupid</i></span><i>!</i> Why is this statement not as silly as it sounds? We point to the law and say that a rape has
not occurred without an actus <st1:City><st1:place><span class=GramE>reus</span></st1:place></st1:City>
and mens rea. It's different to say that
someone was "raped" in the actus <st1:City><st1:place><span class=GramE>reus</span></st1:place></st1:City>
sense than to say that someone committed the <i>crime </i>of rape. There's a problem of vocabulary. When we talk about murder, it <i>would </i>make
sense to say that someone was "<i>killed</i>, but not by a <i>murderer</i>". There isn't quite equivalent language for rape,
unless maybe we use "forcible, non-consensual sexual intercourse" for the actus
<st1:City><st1:place><span class=GramE>reus</span></st1:place></st1:City> of
rape.</p>

reasonable and in good faith.<i></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What would be the level of mens rea required to be guilty of
rape at common law? It would appear that
it's negligence. If the man <i>should
have known</i> that the woman was not consenting, that's negligence. That doesn't mean that unreasonable mistake
of fact <i>always</i> implies negligence rather than, say, recklessness. Rape turns out to be a crime of
negligence. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>Dressler's problem is that once you say a mistake is unreasonable no
matter what, that's strict liability. Once you hear the words "you assume the risk", it's strict
liability. That would convert rape to a
general intent crime to a strict liability crime. You're going to basically get in trouble for
wanting to have sex with someone.</span></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At common law, there is always an issue of interpreting instructions
as to whether a certain mens rea term modifies one or several subsequent

events, the claim by the defendant that "I thought she was consenting" becomes
more plausible. This was not previously
an issue under the more narrow rape laws of the past.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>One view is that as

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>The basics  Here's
the problem these laws are designed to fight: the defense will try to get a
bunch of evidence out to try to make the alleged victim look like a
"slut". It can be argued that this
evidence is relevant because it would go to show that the alleged victim has
consensual sex a lot and therefore could reasonably be seen to have had
consensual sex in this particular case. But even when you can make that argument, the character of the alleged
victim is damaged and the jury becomes prejudiced.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p>This will be awful for the woman. Also, why would a woman ever report the
crime?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We might admit evidence that the woman in the Kobe Bryant
case had consensual sex on other occasions, but under rape shield laws, we
won't admit evidence that she had consensual sex with others.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The first question in any criminal or civil case is whether
or not the evidence is relevant. If it's
not relevant, it doesn't belong in the trial. Is it relevant that the victim had blond hair? Is it relevant that the defendant wore a
beard? You can imagine situations where
both are relevant though in many cases these facts would not be relevant.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span class=GramE>All that</span> relevant means is that
there's something about those facts that would move the rational factfinder
towards the side of the prosecution or defense. Some facts are hugely important, and some are just barely relevant.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The second question is whether the <i>probative value</i> of
evidence outweighed by other factors? For example, in the O.J. Simpson case, the prosecution wanted to
introduce evidence that Simpson beat his wife. Is that evidence relevant to whether he killed her? Maybe it is relevant. But is its relevance outweighed by other
factors? In Criminal Procedure, you
learn that prior bad acts are not admissible as evidence to the jury because
they may be prejudicial. If the evidence
has a small amount of factual significance versus a <i>big</i> amount of
prejudice, then that evidence doesn't get admitted.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There may also be a factor of time consumption. How long will it take to put on the
evidence? If it will take six hours to
put on this evidence, but the probative value is low, we might boot it out.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Except for rape shield laws, the admissibility of evidence
is determined primarily by the judge on a case-by-case basis. What is unusual about rape shield laws is
that the legislature has found that certain kinds of evidence are either <i>always</i>
irrelevant or <i>always</i> inadmissible based on public policy considerations.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Sixth Amendment provides the defendant a constitutional
right to cross-examine his accuser and call witnesses on his own behalf. To some degree, rape shield laws undermine
the Sixth Amendment. Almost all rape
shield laws have some exceptions that bow to the Sixth Amendment. These exceptions allow the judge to decide
that in a particular case, the defendants' need to have certain evidence
introduced trumps the victims' interests protected by the rape shield laws.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Supreme Court has held that Sixth Amendment rights are
not absolute. It has never been thought
that you can cross-examine your accuser without any bounds. Not just any cross-examination is allowed.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the "kinky wife" case, Lord <span class=SpellE>Hailsham</span>
says there is no room for mistake of fact as a "defense". He put defense in quotes because he thinks
that failure-of-proof isn't a defense in the ordinary sense. It's sort of more like a lack of
offense. The defense tries to break down
an essential element of the crime, showing that it hasn't been proven beyond a
reasonable doubt.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The rest of the defenses that we'll talk about in this
chapter will fall into the categories of justification and excuse.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If conduct is justified, it doesn't need to be excused. A justification defense says that what the

<p>Deadly force used in self-defense is justified at common law
when: The defendant is a non-aggressor
and the defendant reasonably believes that deadly force is necessary to repel
an imminent, unlawful, and deadly attack by the other person. This set of elements also fit the structure
of a justification defense, namely: (1) Proportionality  the force used is
proportional and reasonable in relation to the harm threatened. (2) Necessity  the force used is necessary
to protect the interest at stake. <i>Deadly
force</i> generally means either force <i>likely</i> to cause <i>death</i> or <i>serious
bodily harm</i>. In order to justify the
use of self-defense on the basis of deadly force, you must be trying to repel
deadly force in response. You can use
deadly force to defend against potential crimes other than murder.</p>

<p>You can't use deadly force in self-defense if you're the
aggressor at the time of the conflict. In order to find the aggressor, we are looking for an "affirmative
unlawful act reasonably calculated to produce" a potentially fatal fight. Self-defense cannot be claimed by someone who
deliberately puts himself in danger.</p>

<p>Say a defendant shoots someone believing they have a real
gun when the gun is actually <span class=GramE>fake</span>. Under the reasonable belief requirement, even
though the person couldn't or wouldn't have killed the defendant, the defendant
still is acquitted even though what he did was objectively wrong. However, if, on the other hand, the gun was
obviously a toy then the defendant loses the self-defense claim because the
belief about the threat wasn't <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>objectively

<p><i>People v. Goetz </i> The reasonable person standard for
self-defense as justification is an objective standard. Goetz felt that the prosecution gave an
objective standard whereas the standard should have been subjective based on
the statute. The intermediate appellate
court argued that the emphasis in the phrase "he reasonably believes" is on "<i>he</i>". That becomes a subjective standard because
we're not interested in what a reasonable person would do, but rather whether
the defendant thought he was doing a reasonable thing.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The thing is that the defendant will obviously think that
what he's doing is reasonable. But the
defendant may be an <i>unreasonable person</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Court of Appeals of <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>

it to be? Who is that reasonable person?</p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How can it be justifiable to kill an objectively innocent
person? We might excuse someone for it,
but maybe it wouldn't be justified. The
common law says, on the other hand, that such an act would not be justified,
but rather excused. Dressler argues that
this could create a situation where two people could justifiably kill each
other.</p>

for? Does this mean that a woman who
uses self-defense must be judged by the standard of a reasonable woman, or must
she be judged by the objective standard of a reasonable <i>person</i>?<i> </i>The ruling says that the defendant's
actions must be judged subjectively, not objectively. After this case, case law has clarified this
result to mean that they use a "reasonable woman" standard. The Model Penal Code chooses "designedly

in the actor's situation".<i></i></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>§ 3.04(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(<span class=SpellE>i</span>)
deals with one limitation on the use of deadly force: the defendant mustn't
provoke the use of force <i>with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily
injury</i>. The Model Penal Code says
that § 3.04(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>b)(ii) says that you can't use
self-defense if you can retreat, except if you're in your own home or you're a
public officer. The Model Penal Code, as
well as common law, treats human life very, very highly. The sanctity of human life is valued so
highly that the law doesn't even want "bad guys" killed unless it's absolutely
necessary. Thus, it's very difficult
under the Model Penal Code and at common law to win on a self-defense claim.</p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>The Model Penal Code doesn't focus on the amount of time
before the actor will be <span class=GramE>killed,</span> rather, it focuses on
the actor to figure out if it is necessary <i>now</i> to use deadly force
against the victim.</p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>§ 3.04. This statute
uses the word "immediately necessary" rather than "imminent". The provision is general. The deadly force provision is § 3.04(2<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b). Even if you
meet § 3.04(1), there are additional conditions in order for a valid
justification to be constructed.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If an actor's belief is sincere but reckless or negligent,
the actor isn't justified as far as reckless or negligent offenses. If the defendant was <i>negligent</i> in
believing that a toy gun was actually real, then under the Model Penal Code the
defendant wouldn't be guilty of murder. The defendant would be guilty of negligent homicide if the defendant was
negligent, and the defendant would be guilty of manslaughter if the defendant
was reckless.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What the Model Penal Code does that is dramatically
different from common law is that it doesn't like the "all-or-nothing" proposition. In the three situations above, the defendant
is <span class=GramE>not guilty in the first case, not guilty in the second
case,</span> but fully guilty in the third case. On the other hand, the Model Penal Code
allows conviction for a lesser crime in the third case.</p>

<p><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p>Three elements are required in order to show necessity: (1) <span
class=GramE>The</span> act charged must have been done to prevent a significant
evil. (2) There must have been no
adequate alternative. (3) The harm
caused must not have been disproportionate to the harm avoided.</p>

<p><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><i>Nelson v. State </i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'> </span>There's a balancing test here between the harm actually caused
and the harm averted by the act. That's
the very definition of necessity.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The drafters of the Model Penal Code § 3.02 thought the
necessity defense was <i>essential</i> because we want to encourage sort of
"efficient breach" of the law. If
obeying the law involves greater harm to society than breaking the law, we want
people to break it. This is kind of a
belt to keep the legislature's pants from falling down in exceptional
situations. If the legislature would
have said "Yes, break the law in this case", then we want to let the offender
off the hook. It would be irrational to
want people to obey the law if we believed that the legislature in a certain
situation would say "do break the law" because that would result in a better
outcome for society than obeying the law.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Although necessity (or the "choice of evils" justification
defense) is typically thought of as a utilitarian justification because of its
balancing aspect, it can also be viewed in non-utilitarian terms by comparing
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>moral </i>value of one choice of
action against another.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A defendant must actually believe that his conduct is
necessary to avert a greater evil (and not an equal or lesser evil). The necessity defense doesn't help you if you
recklessly or negligently created the necessity.</p>

<p><i>The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens </i> This is the single
most important case in Anglo-American jurisprudence to deal with the following
question: is it ever justifiable to kill an innocent person in order to save a
greater number of innocent persons?<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>The court suggests that sometimes the
law has to set up standards that we can't really live up to. Can we punish someone when we all would have
done the same thing?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you're a retributivist, then it is never right to kill an
innocent person in order to save a greater number of innocent lives. If you're a Kantian, you believe that you
must never use a person as a means to an end rather than as an end in
itself. That's what Dudley and Stephens
did with Parker: they used him as a means to an end, violating what Kant would
say is a categorical imperative.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923289"><b>Excuse</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Excuse focuses on the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actor</i>,
not the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>act</i>. Excuse concedes that the act was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bad</i>, but there was something about the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actor</i> such that we're willing to let
them go without punishment. When we use
an excuse defense, the burden of proof is placed on the <i>defendant</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Bentham</span> says that an excuse is a
defense when their conduct was <span class=SpellE>nondeterrable</span>. The only use for punishment, in a utilitarian
view, is deterrence. Therefore, if there
is no value to punishment and only a net social cost, we shouldn't punish.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>However, say there are some people who are genuinely
undeterrable. There may still be some
utilitarian value in punishing an undeterrable person due to specific
deterrence or incapacitation. What about
the general deterrence value in punishing an undeterrable person? If we excuse an undeterrable person, someone
else might get the wrong message. Someone else might believe that they can convince a jury that <i>they</i>
are undeterrable. Generally speaking,
they may be less likely to obey the law because they will perceive it as full
of holes.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Retributivists say that we have excuses because we don't
want to <i>blame</i> those who were not <i>responsible</i> for their
actions. To blame someone who is not
responsible for his actions is a <i>falsehood</i>. It is a matter of justice to excuse certain
people even though they have caused some social harm.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Excuse law is now explained almost exclusively by some sort
of retributive theory rather than utilitarian theory. Even the utilitarian argument has a
retributivist aspect to it.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Our theories of excuse are: (1) Utilitarian theories, (2)
causation, (3) character, and (4) choice (personhood).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Duress is an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>excuse</i>
and not a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>justification</i>. Most jurisdictions treat it in this way. At common law, duress is no excuse for
murder. In the Model Penal Code,
however, there is no murder exception.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

href="../../../Application%20Data/Microsoft/Word/unitedstatesvcontentopachon.htm"></a><a
href="../../../Application%20Data/Microsoft/Word/unitedstatesvcontentopachon.htm"></a>There
are three elements of the duress defense, according to the court: (1) immediacy
of the threat, (2) well-grounded fear of the threat, and (3) lack of <span
class=SpellE>escapability</span> from the threat.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Another way of describing duress as an excuse is that a
person will be acquitted of any crime other than murder if: (1) the coercer
issues an unlawful threat to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>imminently</i>
kill or grievously injure the defendant or another person, and (2) the
defendant was not at fault in exposing himself to the threat.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The court also says that a necessity defense suggests that
there was no social harm on balance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>On
the other hand, the court says that duress suggests there was no
culpability. The court therefore implies
that necessity is a justification rather than an excuse.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Model Penal Code definition of duress is <i>revolutionary</i>
compared to the common law. It's
different from the common law definition in many different ways. There is a limit to duress under Model Penal
Code § 3.02: the threat listed is "unlawful force". Only humans can do unlawful things. The Model Penal Code is like the common law
in the fact that it limits the defense of duress to human threats. However, under the category of necessity, the
Model Penal Code would allow either natural <i>or</i> human threats. The Model Penal Code is well aware of
this. It says that even if § 3.02 <span
class=GramE>applies</span>, § 2.09 may still apply if you're dealing with a
human threat.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What's different about the Model Penal Code provision on
duress than the common law? In the Model
Penal Code, there need not be an imminent threat. Also, under the Model Penal Code, a "kill or
be killed" threat could work as an excuse: there is no murder exclusion. Finally, it is a "<i>person of reasonable
firmness</i>" standard. It's an
objective rather than a subjective standard.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>People v. </i><st1:City><st1:place><i>Anderson</i></st1:place></st1:City><i>
</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> </span>At common law, duress was
not a defense to murder. Some
intentional killings, if they are the result of provocation, reduce murder to
manslaughter. But this isn't a heat of
passion case. Adequate provocation makes
someone angry which makes them intentionally kill. It's a lot harder to control yourself when
you're very angry. When we've very
angry, our self-control is undermined. But we don't think one's self-control is <i>fully</i> undermined by
anger. When you're angry, you could do a
lot of things other than kill. You could
vent your anger in some other way.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Why couldn't you have fear in place of anger in "heat of
passion"? Fear is an emotion that is
like anger in that it makes self-control more difficult. We may be able to empathize more with fear
than with anger.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>Anderson</st1:place></st1:City>'s point
is that if you give a defense for killings caused by adequate provocation
leading to anger leading to the intent to kill, then it follows that you should
give a similar defense with fear in the place of anger. Dressler seems to argue for just such a partial
defense.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Model Penal Code would actually agree with <st1:City><st1:place>Anderson</st1:place></st1:City>,
although they wouldn't use duress to get there and they wouldn't use the "heat
of passion" excuse. You would go
straight to manslaughter based on the fact that the homicide was committed
under "extreme emotional distress". The
Model Penal Code necessity defense allows the intentional killing of an
innocent person to save a greater number of lives. In a Model Penal Code jurisdiction, you could
have a complete defense.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two models of diminished capacity: (1) the mens
rea model and (2) the partial responsibility model.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Model Penal Code § 4.02 reminds us that medical or
psychiatric evidence can be used not only to prove insanity, but to proof the
lack of a certain mens rea necessary for to prove a crime. On the other hand, when all of the elements
of the crime <i>have </i>been proven, some courts will reduce the offense from
murder to manslaughter on the grounds that a person should be found to be <i>partially
responsible</i> for the homicide. It's a
case of <i>partial</i> diminished capacity rather than <i>total loss</i> of
capacity. Courts recognize that there
are some people who are not insane, but also are not <i>fully</i> responsible
for their actions.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Very few states recognize diminished capacity. The Model Penal Code, however, <i>does </i>recognize
this concept. Manslaughter, under the
Model Penal Code, covers extreme <i>mental </i>disturbance, not just extreme <i>emotional</i>
disturbance. Any state that recognizes
"EMED" implicitly recognizes the diminished capacity doctrine. But most states have abolished the "partial
responsibility" version of the diminished capacity doctrine.</p>

Social Background" (RSB) Defense</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>Some think that these three things must be true in order to
convict: (1) <span class=GramE>The</span> defendant committed an act that is
condemnable. (2) The defendant can be
condemned personally insofar as the defendant could have behaved in conformity
to law. (3) Society stands in relation
to the defendant such that it is entitled to condemn him.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Some say that people with a bad upbringing may be
undeserving of condemnation because they don't satisfy either #2 or #3
above. This is also known as the "social
environmental" defense.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about RSB as a <i>partial</i> excuse? If you steal something though you can afford
to buy it, maybe the social harm is greater than if you couldn't afford to buy
it.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>How would we explain this excuse in terms of the excuse
theories we have previously discussed? </i>Delgado
would say RSB is a <i>causation</i> excuse. Delgado would say that being poor <i>caused</i> people to commit a
crime. The causation theory is the
broadest of all the excuse theories. In
fact, causation theory can excuse <i>all</i> criminal conduct. Everything that you're responsible for is
caused by something else, so we would have results that don't seem to conform
to our notions of fairness.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>On the other hand, Dressler would argue that the "free
choice" theory of excuse is the narrowest of the three non-utilitarian
theories. "Did the person have both the
capacity and fair opportunity (to apply the three prongs of the
standard)?" If not, then the person may
be excused. With causation, you keep
looking backwards more and more. The
"free choice" theory narrows the focus to the particular moment when the
offense was done.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>What are the problems with the rotten social background
defense?</i> It is suggested that the
defense is "infinitely expandable". There's one view of retributivism that says that people have a "right to
be punished". If you take away that
right, you "dehumanize" people. If we
allow an excuse for the defendant based on RSB, what will the effect be on
society? We must say that the dangerous
person goes back on the street. It also
creates the incentive for other similarly situated to argue that they are
similarly situated and make a claim for a rotten social background
defense. In the long run, if we're
utilitarian, we actually want to reduce the rotten social background that
causes the crime rather than merely eliminate the crime. Then you would get a utilitarian argument for
the defense: if we excuse people with rotten social backgrounds, then we may
give society an incentive to eliminate the conditions that lead to such
backgrounds.</p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923295"><b>Conspiracy
and solicitation</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At common law, conspiracy is <i>agreement between two or
more persons to commit an unlawful act</i>. It's not an act! Before you've
done <i>anything</i> towards committing the actual crime, you could be found
guilty of conspiracy. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>It takes two to tango, and to conspire</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Solicitation is the act of <i>asking someone else to commit
a crime</i>. It's a one-person
crime! It comes even earlier than
conspiracy! If the other person says no
when you ask them to help you commit a crime, <span class=GramE>it's</span>
solicitation. If they say yes, it's
conspiracy! The line between thought,
solicitation, and conspiracy can be very thin. Attempt, on the other hand, will take somewhat more time to
materialize. Also, note that at common
law, asking someone to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>help you </i>commit
a crime is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> solicitation. Only asking someone to do it himself is
solicitation!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>Double </i>and <i>triple</i> inchoate offenses bring us
closer and closer to punishing thought. You can ask someone to help you kill someone, and if they never get the
message, that's a case of failed (<i>attempted</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>)<i> </i></span>solicitation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923296"><b>Attempt</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>This is a tool that law enforcement can use to prevent
crime. We don't want people murdered,
robbed, or raped. So if we have someone
stalking an individual or pointing a gun at someone, we want to give law
enforcement a way to stop potential criminals in the act.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In a <i>complete attempt</i>, the offender does everything
necessary to complete the crime but they fail (e.g. you shoot someone but they
don't die). In an <i>incomplete attempt</i>,
the offender gets stopped short from completing the attempt.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>However, <i>preventive
law enforcement</i></span> can't explain why we have inchoate offenses for <i>complete</i>
attempt. We might say that they are as
culpable as the actual offender, but they just got lucky (or unlucky). Also, the person who failed this time might
succeed next time. That person might be
dangerous. Finally, complete attempts
may be subject to general deterrence. Dressler says general deterrence is <i>not</i> an argument for inchoate
offenses.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><i>McQuirter</i></span><i> v. State  </i><span
class=SpellE>McQuirter</span> was arrested for "attempt to commit an assault
with intent to rape". Assault, at common
law, was an attempted battery. So, we
can parse this crime as "attempt to attempt a battery with intent to
rape". This is a triple inchoate crime!<i></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about the social harm? If there was less harm, shouldn't there be less of a penalty? That's almost exclusively a utilitarian
argument. Utilitarians are concerned
with what will happen in the future. Retributivists are concerned with having you "pay your debt to society". But there are two kinds of retributivists:
"harm" retributivists and "culpability" retributivists. "Culpability" retributivists would say that
we should punish attempt and completed offense equally.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>To a retributivist, inchoate laws themselves create a
problem: where's the harm? If I try to
kill Mr. X but I fail, where's the harm? If there's no harm, maybe there should be no punishment.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Recall one definition of social harm: "[N]<span
class=SpellE>egation</span>, endangering, or destruction of an individual,
group, or state interest, which [is] deemed socially valuable."</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There's also a utilitarian argument for punishing attempt
less than a completed offense: marginal deterrence. If you're starting to attempt a crime, but
you still have an incentive to stop early, you may still be deterred.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>Objectivism versus subjectivism</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>An objectivist doesn't look inside the head of the offender
and doesn't punish unless and until you can find <i>objectively</i> that
there's harm. A subjectivist is focused
on what the person has in mind, expressed through their statements or their
conduct. An objectivist who focuses on
harm will likely say "less punishment for less harm". A subjectivist will say "equal punishment for
equal culpability".</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Model Penal Code is subjectivist and generally treats
attempted crimes as severely as completed crimes. The exception is murder or first-degree
felonies. For the most serious crimes,
they give a benefit to the attempter by reducing the grade of the crime.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At common law, the mens rea of attempt is the intent to do
the act that constitutes the attempt <i>and</i> the intent that the underlying
offense be committed. So if you fire a
gun at someone intending to scare them but not to kill them and you miss, you
will not be guilty of attempted murder or attempted manslaughter.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>Attempt is a specific intent crime</i>. It requires the <i>specific intent</i> to
have some future act happen. Attempt
always requires intent. <span
class=GramE>Even if the underlying crime doesn't require intent (like extreme
reckless murder), the attempt <i>does</i> require intent.</span></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>People v. Gentry</i>  This looks a lot like a battered
wife case. It seems highly unlikely that
the events unfolded the way they did. The wife probably perjured herself at trial.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you're dealing with a completed attempt, use § 5.01(1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a) or (b). If
you're dealing with an incomplete attempt, use § 5.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c)
<i>and</i> § 5.01(2). If you're dealing
with a conduct offense, use § 5.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a). If you're dealing with a <i>result</i> crime,
use § 5.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Many jurisdictions say that when you use the common law
definition of attempt, what we really mean is purpose, not knowledge. Some jurisdictions say that intent means
purpose <i>or</i> knowledge. They say he
basically acted purposely. We have a
split. The Model Penal Code gives us an
answer by having the word "belief" in there.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How far do you have to do from thought to completion in
order to have an attempt? In general,
there's an attempt when someone takes a substantial step towards the commission
of an offense with the intent to commit that offense. At common law, this was a misdemeanor, no
matter what the "target" offense was. Today, attempt to commit a felony is a felony.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc58923298"><b>Tests
for attempt</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Last act test </i> A
criminal attempt only occurs when the actor has performed all the acts they
believe are necessary to commit the target offense. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Physical
proximity test </i> To be guilty of attempt, the actor's conduct must be so
near to the completed offense that it would result in that offense actually
happening if the actor wasn't hindered by outside circumstances. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dangerous

"danger of success" is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very great</i>. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Indispensable
element test </i> There is no attempt if the actor has not obtained some
indispensable feature of the criminal plan. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Probable desistence test</i>  The
actor has committed an attempt if they reached a point where it's unlikely that
they would have "voluntarily desisted from his effort to commit the
crime". <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Unequivocality</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> (<span class=SpellE>res</span> <span
class=SpellE>ipsa</span> <span class=SpellE>loquitur</span>) test </i> An act
isn't an attempt until it ceases to be equivocal. This is an objectivist test.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>With only a few exceptions, most jurisdictions that follow
the common law don't follow one particular test. Usually, a jurisdiction will use multiple
versions of these tests. For the
purposes of the exam and for purposes of being a lawyer in a non-Model Penal
Code jurisdiction, you must be familiar with <i>all</i> the tests. The Model Penal Code has its own test, so you
would use that test in a Model Penal Code jurisdiction.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are a few states that really actually apply a particular
common law test, like <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>. In most states, all of these tests and more
are out there and may be considered.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In a Model Penal Code jurisdiction, there is a defense of
"renunciation". You must freely and
completely give up your plan. If you're
an objectivist, what is your position? Should we recognize a defense of genuine abandonment of the criminal
plan? The objectivist would reject the
defense, while a subjectivist would accept the defense. If you have truly renounced your dangerous intentions,
you are no longer dangerous or culpable.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The common law tends to be objectivist, while the Model
Penal Code tends to be subjectivist.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We don't want to find attempt too close to the mere
"thinking" stage because that would be unjust, but we don't want to find
attempt to close to the "completion" stage because we want a shot at preventing
the criminal conduct.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>State v. Reeves </i> Look at § 5.01(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>c)
because this was an incomplete attempt. You will be guilty if you do a "substantial step" towards the commission
of the crime.<i> </i>In § 5.01(2), there
are a bunch of things that are examples of things that <i>may</i> be sufficient
to corroborate the actor's criminal purpose. We don't want to punish innocent people. The poison in the purse is presumably strongly corroborative.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But if any of the categories § 5.01(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
through (g) are present, it just means that it's not legally permissible for a
judge to hold that it's not legally sufficient. To put it another way, if any of these factors are present, the case
should go to a jury and it would be wrong to direct a verdict of acquittal for
a defendant if they meet one of those categories and it's strongly
corroborative of criminal conduct. The
categories (a) through (g) are only for the judge. They are not read to the jury. The jury only hears the "substantial step"
language.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Model Penal Code is strongly distinguished from the
common law in that most of the common law tests <i>look back</i> to see how
close the defendant has come to completion. The Model Penal Code test asks how far the defendant has gone from the
thought process. If the defendant has
taken a substantial step towards committing the crime, even if <i>there is a
lot more to be done</i>, you can convict. Therefore, it's much easier to convict under the Model Penal Code than
at common law.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc58923299"><b>Defenses
to attempt</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>People v. Thousand</i>  The defendant is charged with
attempting to send pornography to an underage female when in fact he sent
pornography to an overage male. The
charge is attempted distribution of obscene material to a minor. From the defendant's perspective, the
individual was not really a minor, so it's impossible for the defendant to have
committed the crime. Thousand claims
legal impossibility. The court punts on
this distinction because they claim that neither impossibility defense exists
anymore in <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State> due to
statute.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc58923300"><b>Factual
impossibility versus legal impossibility</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In traditional common law, here is a good definition of
legal versus factual impossibility: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Legal impossibility </i>occurs when the
actions which the defendant performs or sets in motion, even if fully carried
out as he desires, would not constitute a crime. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Factual impossibility </i>occurs when the objective of the defendant is
proscribed by the criminal law but a circumstance unknown to the actor prevents
him from bringing about that objective. At common law, factual impossibility is no defense, while legal
impossibility <i>is</i> a defense.</p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p>Pure legal impossibility means "pure mistake of law". Everything is exactly factually the way you
think it is, but you just don't understand the law. Just as ignorance of the law is no excuse,
ignorance of the law doesn't make a crime. The pure version of legal impossibility remains a defense in the Model
Penal Code, but even if it weren't, the legality principle would require us to
reach the same result.</p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>However, most of
the cases of so-called legal impossibility involve this kind of "hybrid"
situation. Because they are hybrid and
because you can make a plausible legal argument to suggest that it's factual
impossibility, which is not a defense at common law, and you can also make an
argument that it's legal impossibility, which </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>is </i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>a defense at common
law, there must be a problem with the law.</span></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>Jaffe</i>  The <i>Jaffe</i> court said that Jaffe's act wouldn't
have been a crime if it had been completed. That is, we wouldn't otherwise punish someone for receiving non-stolen
property. The <i>Jaffe</i> explanation
is a traditional way to explain legal impossibility.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Utilitarians would say we should abolish this defense
because we want to take dangerous, morally culpable people off the
streets. On the other hand, an
objectivist might say that you're punishing thoughts. The Model Penal Code clearly does away with
one aspect of the impossibility defense. But even in some non-Model Penal Code states, their law may be
interpreted to eliminate this defense.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc58923301"><b>Complicity</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two kinds of complicity: (1) Accomplice liability,
and (2) conspiratorial liability.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Accomplice liability and conspiratorial liability overlap
99%. Most of the time, if you could be
held liable under accomplice liability, then you could also be held liable
under conspiratorial liability and vice versa. <span class=GramE>But not always.</span> There are a few cases where someone is one but not the other.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The common law terms were make-or-break distinctions for
prosecutors at common law. Virtually no
state today follows the odd, technical common law rules that existed way back
when. But even though that's true and
some of the distinctions between the terms have disappeared, you will find that
courts even today will talk about defendants using those terms. To understand what they're talking about, you
need to refer to the original common law definitions.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>For a very long time, an accessory after the fact is no
longer part of this analysis. That sort
of person who is described as an accessory after the fact today is not deemed
to be guilty of the crime for which they were accessory after the fact. We'll hold them guilty of "obstruction of
justice" or "misprision of a felony".</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>State v. <span class=SpellE>Hoselton</span> </i> The
only evidence that showed that the defendant was an accomplice was his
statement during questioning that "you could say that" he was a "lookout". Is there enough evidence to convict the
defendant of entering with intent to commit larceny? If the State can show that the defendant was
a lookout, the defendant may be convicted as a principal in the second degree
(someone who helped out at the actual time of the crime).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>You'll be liable as an accomplice if: (1) <span class=GramE>The</span>
person gave helped out in the crime, or (2) the person had the intent to
promote or facilitate the commission of the crime. So the actus <st1:City><st1:place><span
  class=GramE>reus</span></st1:place></st1:City> is: you've acted, you've
encouraged, or you've made an omission when you should have done
something. The mens rea is: intent to
aid and intent that your assistance <span class=GramE>result</span> in the
commission of the offense. Whenever you
think about accomplice liability, think about actus <st1:City><st1:place><span
  class=GramE>reus</span></st1:place></st1:City> first: how did the defendant
aid? Then go to the mens rea. Did the defendant intend to do that act? Did the defendant also intend that the act
result in the commission of an offense?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>You can be found guilty if you did it, or if you're <i>legally
accountable</i> for the person who did do it. But when are you legally accountable? There are three circumstances, but we only need to worry about two of
them. MPC § 2.06(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>c)
involves accomplice liability.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What makes someone an accomplice? You need the mens rea of <i>purpose</i>, and
the actus <st1:City><st1:place><span class=GramE>reus</span></st1:place></st1:City>
of solicitation, aiding, or failing to carry out a legal duty. It's kind of like the common law so far.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you've given your friends a psychological boost by
promising to help themthat's encouragement. If the assistance isn't prearranged, they don't get the benefit of the
encouragement. If there's no
prearrangement, and thus no encouragement, and the <i>attempt</i> to aid <i>fails,</i>
then at common law, the defendant isn't an accomplice. Under the Model Penal Code, the <i>attempt </i>makes
him guilty as an accomplice. Mere
prearrangement can give you both the mens rea and the actus <st1:City><st1:place><span
  class=GramE>reus</span></st1:place></st1:City> at common law. The agreement to aid is a mens rea of
accomplice liability in the Model Penal Code.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923302"><b>Mens

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>People v. <span class=SpellE>Lauria</span> </i> To
establish the mens rea necessary to convict a supplier of conspiracy, you need
either direct evidence that he plans to participate in the criminal activity of
another or you need to be able to draw an inference that he has a special
interest in the activity or show that the crime is of an aggravated nature.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This case teaches us two important things: (1) Sometimes you
can infer purpose from knowledge. For
example, they might have a stake in the venture. If the Sacramento Bee charges prostitutes
more to advertise than others, then you can infer that the Bee wants them to
succeed in prostitution. (2) This is
dicta: but the possibility is suggested that for <i>really serious crimes</i>,
maybe we should be able to punish people <i>simply</i> on the basis of
knowledge and not purpose. Sometimes you
can infer purpose from knowledge, but you usually need something extra in order
to draw the inference.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The common law is deeply divided. Many jurisdictions say only purpose will
do. Some jurisdictions are willing to punish
on the basis of mere knowledge, at least for serious crimes. The Model Penal Code requires purpose.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>State v. Foster </i> Accessorial liability for
criminally negligent homicide requires the same level of culpability as the
underlying offense, that is, negligence. Even though you can't <i>attempt</i> or <i>conspire</i> to commit an
offense that doesn't require <i>intent</i>, you can be an <i>accessory</i> to
such an offense.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In this case, we still need to prove the first intent, but
what is <i>really</i> required for the crime is simply that the <span
class=GramE>person have</span> the mens rea required for the commission of the
offense. If the crime has a mens rea of
intent, then the "second intent" would be <i>intent</i>. But if the crime is a crime of recklessness,
the mens rea required would be recklessness. The "second intent" is a misnomer, except for crimes of intent.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What's the policy argument for stating accomplice liability
in this way? The court asks why we would
require a higher mens rea for the accomplice than we do for the principal. If we're willing to convict Cannon on the
basis of criminal negligence, why should we require a higher mens rea for
Foster? This seems like a sensible
policy argument. If the legislature has
decided that people should be punished for criminally negligently killing people,
then people who help them should be judged and punished just the same.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What makes a risk unjustifiable? It's product of the gravity and the risk of
the harm. This is the Learned Hand
formula, more or less. What goes on the
other side of the balance? It's her
purpose in encouraging the cab driver to speed.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>§ 2.06(4) deals with result crimes: (4) When causing a
particular result is an element of an offense, an accomplice in the conduct
causing such result is an accomplice in the commission of that offense if he
acts with the kind of culpability, if any, with respect to that result that is
sufficient for the commission of the offense.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If we want to find out whether someone is an accomplice in
the commission of an offense, we go back to § 2.06(3). So an accomplice in the conduct becomes an
accomplice in the offensive if they act with the kind of culpability <i>with
respect to that result</i> that is sufficient for that offense. If the defendant doesn't have that kind of
culpability, they should be acquitted of that offense.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Look at § 2.06 as a <i>three-step question</i>: (1) <span
class=GramE>What</span> <i>conduct </i>caused the result? (2) Was the defendant an <i>accomplice</i> in
the <i>conduct</i> that caused the result? (3) If yes, did the defendant have the level of culpability <i>regarding
the result</i>, as stated in the definition of the offense?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you don't solicit the thing that caused the result, you
can argue that you weren't an accomplice.</p>

is the defendant's culpability, and it results in a big difference in the
potential penalty. Why don't we follow
this principle in this case?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It appears that <span class=SpellE>Linscott</span> was only
negligent as to the victim's death. If
the perpetrator of a negligent homicide would get, say, 5 years in prison, why
should an accomplice to murder get life in prison? In the last case, the court said that <i>commensurability
is the key</i>. Why should we be willing
to punish an accomplice based on a lesser mens rea than that of the primary
offender?</p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923304"><b>"Natural
and probable consequences" doctrine</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A majority of jurisdictions follow the "natural and probable
consequences" doctrine. This basically means
the same thing as "foreseeable consequences" which more or less means the same
thing as negligence.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Note that the Model Penal Code <i>rejects</i> the "natural
and probable consequences" doctrine.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>To understand how this doctrine works, you first ask the question,
basically: was the defendant an accomplice of this other person as to Crime
#1? In this case, <span class=SpellE>Linscott</span>
was, unarguably, an accomplice in the robbery. He meets all the normal criteria of being an accomplice to the
robbery. He assisted the robbery, he had
the proper intent; he should be convicted of robbery. Once you do that, if Crime #2 was also
committed, a person who was an accomplice in Crime #1 will also be deemed an
accomplice of Crime #2 if Crime #2 was a <i>natural and probable consequence</i>
of Crime #1.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc58923305"><b>Presence</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><i>State v. <span class=SpellE>Vaillancourt</span> </i>
What's the argument by the prosecutor for indicting the defendant? What exists in the case that justifies
treating him as an accomplice?<i> </i><span
class=SpellE>Vaillancourt</span> was talking to the primary offender. Also, the defendant came to the house with
the primary defendant. That suggests
that they didn't just <i>happen to be there at the same time</i>, but actually <i>came
there together</i>. That makes a
somewhat stronger argument that they are more than just physically proximate to
each other.<i></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>Mere physical presence at the scene of the crime cannot,
by that mere fact alone, make someone an accomplice. </i>You have to assist, and you have to have
a mens rea. However, presence can
frequently get us closer to the point where we can say that someone has
assisted. So what's the extra <i>something
</i>you have to have in order to be an accomplice?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>Wilcox v. Jeffery</i>  Regarding the rapeswhat is the
liability, if any, of the cheering customers, non-cheering customers, and the
bartender? Does the bartender have a
legal duty to act to prevent the rape? The bartender would seem to be responsible to protect his
customers. Since this is a business and
the victim was a customer, he owes a legal duty to her.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Can we get the non-cheering customers for rape? Based on what we've learned, they don't have
a duty to prevent the crime. If they
have a duty to stop a crime, all of us have a duty to stop any crime that
occurs in our presence. That may be a
moral duty, but it's not a legal duty under the criminal law. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Think of Jeffrey <span class=SpellE>Strohmeyer</span>. He didn't have a legal duty to stop his
friend from raping a girl.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about the cheering customers? Could you get them for encouragement? What if the rapists were deaf? Would that make a difference? Does this make any sense?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How do we explain <i>Wilcox</i>? How can Wilcox be deemed an accomplice while
none of the other thousands of people at the auditorium are found to be
accomplices? If Wilcox had booed,
apparently he would have been off the hook.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There's another problem here. Let's assume that Wilcox is the only person
who encouraged Hawkins and specifically encouraged him to break the law. But hadn't the crime already happened? The crime started when Hawkins entered the
country without the appropriate documentation. Wilcox didn't assist in getting him into the country illegally. But by the time of the concert, it would seem
that the crime has already occurred. Dressler assumes that this isn't being discussed because this crime is
viewed as a continuing crime. That is,
every second Hawkins is in the country illegally, a crime continues and
therefore anyone who helps at any time is an accomplice.</p>

<p><i>State v. <span class=SpellE>Helmenstein</span> </i> You
can't convict in <st1:State><st1:place>North Dakota</st1:place></st1:State> on
the testimony of an accomplice unless that testimony is corroborated by a
non-accomplice. The accomplice has an
ulterior reason to testify against his fellow accomplices. In multi-party crimes, the prosecution will
go after the little guy and try to get them to cheese them out. Then the accomplice has the incentive to say,
"Just tell me what to say, and I'll say it." Accomplices have their own reasons to lie or make it look like the other
guy did more than him. Many
jurisdictions say there must be <i>something</i> to confirm the testimony of an
accomplice.<i></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Prosecutors love accomplice liability.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>People v. </i><st1:City><st1:place><i>Genoa</i></st1:place></st1:City><i>
</i> What was <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City> prosecuted
for, and why did the court throw out the conviction? A <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
police officer tried to get <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City>
involved in a purported scheme to buy cocaine. The cop says: "Give me $10,000, I'll buy and sell the cocaine and give
you a profit." <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City>
got the money and gave it to the cop. He
gets arrested and charged with "attempted possession with intent to deliver
cocaine". But <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City>
never wanted to possess cocaine. What's
up? The prosecutor's theory is that <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City>
was an accomplice to the crime of possession with intent to deliver, or more
properly, he was an accomplice to the crime of <i>attempted </i>possession with
intent to deliver.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let's avoid the impossibility doctrine! Why does <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City>
get off the hook? The crime never really
took place, and <i>at common law</i> you need to derive your liability from
some underlying crime; that's what accomplice liability is all about. Since the cop committed no crime, there is no
crime to be an accomplice to. If the
social harm of the crime or of the attempt hasn't happened, there's nothing to
get the accomplice for. There must be
something <i>over there</i> we can connect our accomplice to.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What would be the result in <st1:City><st1:place><i>Genoa</i></st1:place></st1:City>
under the Model Penal Code? I think <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City>
would be guilty. § 5.01(3) <span
class=GramE>shows</span> this clearly: (3) Conduct Designed to Aid Another in Commission of a Crime. A person
who engages in conduct designed to aid another to commit a crime that would
establish his complicity under Section 2.06 if the crime were committed by such
other person, is guilty of an attempt to commit the crime, although the crime
is not committed or attempted by such other person.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Has the Model Penal Code rejected the derivative liability
concept? How can <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City>
be guilty of a crime that was never occurred or attempted? How can we explain the result without getting
rid of derivative liability? In common
law terminology, <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City> is an
accessory before the fact, which would suggest we're getting rid of derivative
liability.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But maybe <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City>
is the principle in the first degree. He's guilty of the crime of <i>attempting to aid in the possession with
intent to deliver cocaine</i>. The Model
Penal Code says that <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City> would be
guilty as the perpetrator. From the
Model Penal Code's subjectivist point of view, <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City>
is just as culpable and dangerous as someone who completed a crime. From the objectivist way of looking at it,
there is no social harm and <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City>
should be let off.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Under the Model Penal Code, we ask: <i>would this person have
been an accomplice under § 2.06 had a crime been committed?</i> If the answer is yes, then you can be guilty <i>not
as an accomplice</i> but as the <i>perpetrator of the attempt</i>. <st1:City><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:City>
becomes the principal in the first degree of the <i>attempt</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Can we do § 5.01(3) with solicitation and not just aid? In § 2.06, solicitation is in a different
subcategory from aiding. § 5.01(3) <span
class=GramE>seems</span> to deal only with <i>aid</i> and not <i>solicitation</i>. Is this a glitch? Is this inconsistent? Well, you could still be guilty of <i>solicitation</i>
to commit a crime, which is usually as serious as the completed crime
anyway. <span class=GramE>So, no problem
really.</span> <span class=GramE>Doesn't
really matter.</span></p>

<p><i>Bailey v. Commonwealth</i>  Must Bailey have shared a

degree? "[O]<span class=SpellE>ne</span>
who <span class=GramE>effects</span> a criminal act through an innocent or
unwitting agent is a principal in the first degree." Bailey is not a principal in the second
degree because he wasn't at the scene of the crime. He wasn't an accessory before the fact
because he didn't do any preplanning with the officers. Bailey <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i>
a principal in the first degree by the "innocent instrumentality" doctrine.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How would this case be decided under the Model Penal
Code? § 2.06(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a)
gets us there. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There are two ways we've
looked at where you can be held responsible for the conduct of another: you can
be an accomplice, or you can cause an innocent person to carry out your evil
deeds for you. Innocent means someone
who would lack the mens rea for the crime or would be excused from the
crime. Irresponsible more or less means
insane. § 2.06(1) says that you can be
held responsible for a crime based on <i>your own conduct</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i>State v. Hayes</i>  Why is it that Hill is not guilty of
the burglary and larceny charges for which the government has charged
Hayes? Hill has no mens rea. He had no intent to commit either crime. He was just trying to trap Hayes. Hayes gets off because there's no liability
to derive from, since Hill didn't commit a crime. We can't get Hayes on the innocent
instrumentality doctrine, because Hill manipulated Hayes rather than vice
versa.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What could we get Hayes for under the Model Penal Code given
these events? We could get him for
solicitation. But there's also something
that we can get him for. We could
convict him of <i>attempted burglary</i>really,<i> attempting to aid and abet
a burglary</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We can also get him for larceny at common law or under the
Model Penal Code. These days, with penal
codes that get thicker and thicker and thicker, there's usually a way to
convict a person of a crime if you are creative enough.</p>

<p><st1:country-region><st1:place><i>United States</i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i>
v. Lopez</i>  "Intolerable prison condition" claims: a person escapes prison
and tries to avoid conviction for the break based on the conditions in the
prison. It makes sense if the prison is
on fire to try to escape because it's necessity. Duress is an excuse, necessity is a
justification. This has some relevance
to Lopez. Necessity is balancing evils
from a societal perspective. But we're
not interested in her, we're interested in McIntosh. It definitely matters to him whether Lopez's
defense is characterized by justification or excuse. Justifications are "universal" and excuses are
"personal". If we believe that Lopez's
leaving the prison was justified, then McIntosh becomes the accomplice in a <i>justified</i>
act, that is, something we think is <i>good</i> not <i>bad</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If what Lopez did was excusable, then we won't excuse him
because <i>his</i> life wasn't at risk. We will say that something bad has happened that someone must pay
for. Or suppose Lopez escapes but is not
liable because she's insane. McIntosh
shouldn't be able to benefit from her insanity.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the Lopez case, McIntosh would be convicted as an
accomplice of a crime that occurred but is "invisible" to us because we're
letting her off on the grounds of duress. She intended to escape. We're
just letting her off because of her excuse. McIntosh is not using Lopez as an instrumentality.</p>

we discussed in class (including on TWEN) is fair game.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The multiple choice portion will be much more heavily common
law than the essays. It will also be
general principles about legality, retribution, all that stuff. If we've learned any constitutional law,
that's fair game. We'll also be tested
on statutory work: reading, interpreting, and working with a statute. There will be two types of questions: some
questions will have a short set of facts and then four possible answers based
on the facts. You have a "little mini
factual pattern" and then a couple of answer. Some questions will be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rule-oriented</i>. For example, "Which of the following
statements about insanity is incorrect?" Or, "Which of the following crimes is a general intent crime at common
law?" These kinds of questions you can
usually do in 30 secondsyou either know the answer or you don't. You'll spend longer on the "mini fact
patterns".</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At least twice on the multiple <span class=GramE>choice</span>,
you'll have "Facts for Questions X-Y". Sometimes, you'll also have to apply a statue from the casebook. But you won't act like you're in state <span
class=GramE>X,</span> you'll act like you're in an imaginary state that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>just happens</i> to have the same statute as
state X. So in these questions, use the
facts of the case and the statute. It
won't be the same state each time.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Part Two is entirely a Model Penal Code question. It's a homicide question. In Part A, there will be certain facts, but
then in Part B, certain facts will be added. This question will cover accomplice liability too. It will apply basic § 2.06 complicity law.</p>

saying what the Model Penal Code says verbatim. That doesn't prove anything! However, you need to cite to the Model Penal Code all the time. Sometimes, you will want to quote from the
Model Penal Code when it's at the core of the discussion. Cutting and pasting from the casebook doesn't
get you any points, though. Using
crucial language <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>will</i> get you points.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>You don't have to tell Dressler what you didn't use; just
tell him what you're using.</p>

<p>Part Three is only 30 minutes. You'll get a rape/sexual assault statute. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>You have to give your opinion on it in terms
of policy. This statute is one that has
actually been out there in the real world. This is our chance to demonstrate that we've thought about rape law and
therefore, given the chance to see a statute that could become the law we can
spot the strengths and weaknesses of it. We won't compare this statute to what the real statute is, but we pretty
much know where the law is and where it's going.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Dressler urges us to skip pages in Bluebooks, if we
write. If you don't do that and you
realize there's something you should have said closer to the front, then you
can use the blank pages.</p>

<p>What Dressler used to do is read through the question

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The dashes stand for certain words. If you've figured out the case correctly, you
might think that mens rea and self-defense are the really big issues. If you're right about that, we can assume
that Dressler has allocated more points to mens rea and self-defense than some
of the other issues. The jigsaw approach
would say that you should tackle the meatiest issues first. But that's not the organized way to do
it. It would be perfect if the big
issues happened to be the things right on top. But by organizing in preparation, you say to yourself: "I've got to get
to mens rea, but I also have to get to self-defense." It forces you to think about and strategize
about what you're going to do when. Keep
in mind that you can't say everything you want to say. People are able to distinguish themselves by
what they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do</i> say.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What if you're running out of time? You might want to skip down to the heavier
issues. Or maybe you should go over the
less weighty issues faster.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How much time should you spend outlining before you start
writing? Maybe it depends on how fast
you type. When Dressler was a student,
there was enormous pressure to keep up with the Joneses. A length answer may also be a disorganized
answer.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When someone grades your answer, they're not going to spend
nearly as much time reading it as you do writing it. But here's a piece of advice: making it
easier for the grader to keep his eyes on what you want him to see will
help. So, <u>underline</u> the key words
that you want the grader to see. It
helps, psychologically to <u>underline</u> or <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>bold</b> key words. Also,
construct your essay answer a little bit like an outline.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><u><span style='font-family:Arial'>State v. Jones ([crime<span
class=GramE>][</span>criminal homicide])</span></u></p>

<p><u><span style='font-family:Arial'><o:p><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></o:p></span></u></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li  style='mso-list:l3 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in'><u><span
     style='font-family:Arial'>Voluntary act</span></u></li>
 <li  style='mso-list:l3 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in'><u><span
     style='font-family:Arial'>Social harm</span></u></li>
 <li  style='mso-list:l3 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in'><u><span
     style='font-family:Arial'>Mens rea</span></u></li>
 <li  style='mso-list:l3 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in'><u><span
     style='font-family:Arial'>Actual causation</span></u></li>
 <li  style='mso-list:l3 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in'><u><span

</ol>

<p><u><span style='font-family:Arial'><o:p><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></o:p></span></u></p>

<p>This not only makes it easier on the grader, but it makes it
easier on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i>. If you're in the "voluntary act" section and
you start talking about mens rea, it helps you get back in the swing of
things. This organizational structure
helps the grader know where I am and helps <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>me</i>
know where I am.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This is the organization that we should use. The organization is self-evident.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Some of the above issues may be big, and others may be
small.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let's go back to social harm for a minute. In this context, Dressler is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> asking us to give us the definition
of social harm. What he's asking us to
do is to talk about the actus <st1:City><st1:place><span class=GramE>reus</span></st1:place></st1:City>
elements of whatever crime we're talking about; that's the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>social harm</i> of that particular crime. For example, at common law, the social harm
of burglary is "breaking and entering the dwelling house of another at
night". In fact, you may break it into
"breaking", "entering", <span class=GramE>"</span>dwelling house" and so
on. Use the definition of the crime that
you're working with. This isn't meant to
be excessively philosophical.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We already know that this exam deals with criminal homicide
under the Model Penal Code. We already know
the social harm of criminal homicide: it's the killing of a human being by
another human being.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>After we've covered the basic five elements, you go to:</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=6 type=1>
 <li  style='mso-list:l3 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in'><u><span
     style='font-family:Arial'>Defenses</span></u><span style='font-family:
     Arial'></span></li>
 <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
  <li  style='mso-list:l3 level2 lfo15;tab-stops:list 1.0in'><span
      style='font-family:Arial'>Justification defenses</span></li>
  <li  style='mso-list:l3 level2 lfo15;tab-stops:list 1.0in'><span
      style='font-family:Arial'>Excuse defenses</span></li>
 </ol>
</ol>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p>Recall that you have nothing to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>excuse</i> if your conduct was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>justifiable</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Unlike the elements of a crime, you should only bring up
those defenses that would realistically be raised by the attorneys in that case
in the real world. You don't need to
take a laundry list of all the justification defenses and show why none of them
apply. Raise the defenses that you think
a real lawyer would raise and discuss them.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about murder versus manslaughter (versus negligent
homicide)? The question is a Model Penal
Code jurisdiction question, where we're supposed to discuss the criminal
liability of A for killing B. We know by
now that the only thing that separates different homicides is mens rea. The voluntary act will be the same no matter
what the crime. The social harm will be
the dead person. What matters will be in
the mens rea discussion. At that point,
you can discuss any relevant mens rea issue. You should always start at the top, that is, with the highest mens rea
that can plausibly be argued by a prosecutor. If the facts plausibly support the mens rea of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>purpose</i>, then that's where you start and you work your way
down. It may be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>obvious </i>that the killing was done purposely. If so, fine, and you don't have to go
down. It may be that the killing is
clearly an accident, and the only issue is whether the killing is reckless or
negligent. But start at the highest mens
rea and work your way down. Cite your
Model Penal Code sections.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Failure-of-proof defenses versus justification and excuse: a
failure-of-proof defense isn't really a "defense": for example, mistake of
fact. A mistake of fact defense isn't
really an affirmative defense. It's a
denial that you had the required mens rea for the crime. Mistake "defenses" shouldn't be talked about
as justifications or excuses. It should
be talked about under the element it supposedly negates.</p>

<p>We've only been asked about homicide. But if the facts of the homicide question
include a felony in which someone died, and it is suggested that the prosecutor

first because it will resolve the felony-murder issue later.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Say, for example, that <span class=GramE>A</span> raped B
and then the victim died. That would

<p>Remember that the Model Penal Code doesn't have the
felony-murder rule as such. If you look
carefully at the definition of murder under the Model Penal Code, you'll find
that under the "extreme indifference" provision, that mens rea will be <i

     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To determine whether the defendant is an
     <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual cause</i> of the social harm
     in this case, we ask, more specifically: "But for the voluntary act of the
     defendant, would the social harm have occurred <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
     normal'>when it did</i>?" If the defendant
     had not shot the victim, the victim would not have become <i
     style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>brain dead</i> when he did, <i
     style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>, alternatively, would not have
     ceased respiration and circulation when he did.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, the defendant is an actual
     cause of the death of the victim.<br>
     <br>
     There are no additional causal requirements in the Code as contemplated in
     § 2.03(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b).</li>
 <li  style='mso-list:l8 level1 lfo20;tab-stops:list .5in'><u>Proximate
     causation </u> The Model Penal Code disposes of the proximate causation
     issue in short order. Because
     purposely causing a certain result (the death of the victim) was an
     element of the defendant's offense, and because the actual result
     involves, arguably, the same kind of injury or harm as that contemplated
     by the defendant, we consult § 2.03(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>b).<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This section tells us that because the
     actual result (death under the traditional definition) is not too remote
     or accidental from the contemplated result that the defendant alleges
     (brain death) to have an effect on the defendant's liability.</li>

<p><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>Bob returned home one day
and, to his shock, observed his wife in bed with Victor. Enraged, Bob stalked out of the house, walked
next door, and angrily asked Ann, his neighbor, for a gun that he knew that she
lawfully kept for self-protection. When
she asked him why he needed it, he angrily stated, "I need a gun to kill
someone." Ann gave him her gun, saying, "Go
get him."</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Tahoma'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Tahoma'>Bob returned to his house
and walked into the bedroom, gun pointed. When he entered, Victor, by now out of the bed, had a large kitchen
knife in his hand. From a distance of 10
feet, Bob shot Victor four times, killing him instantly. Because of his rage, Bob had not seen the
knife in Victor's hand when he shot him.</span></p>

 <li  style='mso-list:l17 level1 lfo21;tab-stops:list .5in'><u>Voluntary
     act</u>  The Model Penal Code requires Bob's conduct to include a
     voluntary act in order for him to be liable for any offense, § 2.01(1).<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bob's conduct included the voluntary act
     of shooting Victor.</li>
 <li  style='mso-list:l17 level1 lfo21;tab-stops:list .5in'><u>Social

 <li  style='mso-list:l17 level1 lfo21;tab-stops:list .5in'><i
     style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><u>Mens rea</u></i>  Under the Model
     Penal Code, in order to be guilty of criminal homicide, a person must
     commit the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actus reus</i> of killing
     another human being purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, §
     210.1. There is evidence that Bob
     acted with purpose in killing Victor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
     </span>Bob told Ann that he was planning to kill someone.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>[Bob also had the motive to kill Victor:
     he was angry at him for sleeping with his wife.]<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This would make Bob guilty of <i
     style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>murder</i>, § 210.2(1)(a), unless a
     jury can be persuaded that Bob was acting under the influence of extreme
     mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation
     or excuse, § 210.3(1)(b), in which case Bob's crime would be <i
     style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>manslaughter</i>.<br>
     <br>
     Bob could argue that witnessing his wife in an apparent act of adultery
     enraged him so much that he experienced extreme emotional distress that
     continued through the time of the actual killing.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This would be a threshold question of
     law for the judge. If the judge
     allowed this argument to go before a jury, Bob would further need to
     persuade the jury that the disturbance was reasonable.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In doing this, Bob needs to try to get
     the jury to sympathize with his position and imagine being in his shoes.<br>
     <br>
     The State would argue, however, that Bob had adequate time in the course
     of going to his neighbor's house and back that he either no longer was under
     the influence of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extreme </i>distress
     or that such distress was no longer <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable
     </i>at the time of the killing. It
     could be argued that, in essence, no one could stay <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
     normal'>that mad </i>for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that long </i>(a
     question for the judge), or that, alternatively, no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
     normal'>reasonable person</i> could stay that mad for that long (a
     question for the jury).<br>
     <br>
     If the fact is conceded that Bob was so enraged that he did not see the
     knife in Victor's hand, Bob could argue that this is evidence that his
     extreme emotional disturbance continued to the moment of the killing.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bob could claim that no one could fail
     to perceive the danger of another person holding a knife unless they were experiencing
     extreme distress of the nature contemplated by the Model Penal Code.<br>
     <br>
     [The purpose of allowing the partial defense of extreme emotional or
     mental disturbance is to recognize that society sees an actor as less at
     fault if they are not in full control of their actions due to a
     disturbance with an understandable or reasonable cause.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, a retributivist would
     find that Bob did not act fully by choice, and thus his culpability is
     limited by his ability to freely choose not to commit the offense.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From a utilitarian perspective, on the
     other hand, someone in a rage like Bob may not be deterred from committing
     murder, and therefore it serves no purpose to punish him for murder
     because, arguably, no net social gain will result.]</li>
 <li  style='mso-list:l17 level1 lfo21;tab-stops:list .5in'><u>Actual
     causation</u>  Under the Model Penal Code, Bob's conduct was an actual cause
     of the death of Victor when Victor's death would not have occurred <i
     style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>but for</i> Bob's voluntary act.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Bob had not shot Victor, Victor would
     not have died.</li>
 <li  style='mso-list:l17 level1 lfo21;tab-stops:list .5in'><u>Proximate
     causation</u>  There are no intervening causes between the firing of the
     gun and the death of Victor.</li>
 <li  style='mso-list:l17 level1 lfo21;tab-stops:list .5in'><u>Defenses</u>
      Bob's killing of Victor was justified for self-protection if Bob
     believed that such force was immediately necessary to protect himself
     against the use of unlawful force by Victor, § 3.04(1).<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because Bob used deadly force, Bob is
     not justified unless he believed that deadly force was necessary to
     protect himself from being killed or seriously injured by Victor, § 3.04(2<span
     class=GramE>)(</span>b). Bob's case
     for justification by self-protection is weak for several reasons: first,
     he did not see the knife in Victor's hand, which makes the use of deadly
     force unjustifiable given the circumstances as Bob believed them to
     be. Furthermore, because Victor was
     10 feet away, Bob will have a hard time proving that he <i
     style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>believed</i> that force was <i

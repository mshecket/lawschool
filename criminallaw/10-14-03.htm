<p><span>When
we study murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide under the Model Penal
Code, the actus </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>reus</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> <i>is always the same</i>. Everything that distinguishes degrees of
murder and types of criminal homicide lies in the <i>mens rea</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the other hand, <i>almost all</i> of what constitutes rape is the <i>actus </i></span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span
  >reus</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Until
the 90s, there was not a single Criminal Law casebook that had a chapter on
rape. The only particular crime that got
its own chapter was criminal homicide. There are <i>still</i> some Criminal Law casebooks that don’t have a
chapter on rape. (Does Dressler suggest
this is political?)</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Some
law professors really want to skip rape. For many professors, it’s a “lose-lose” proposition.</span></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>Dressler
says that there is no other crime that we cover that demonstrates so well that
the law is not fixed and does not just emerge. Instead, it is a function of what our culture is like in our particular
era. The view of what constitutes rape
has changed considerably in the last twenty years, and the law may change even
more in the next 20 years.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
the Model Penal Code was enacted, the provisions on sexual offenses were viewed
as very progressive. Today, they are
seen as archaic.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
are going to try to avoid political correctness.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
will not spend time on these things, but they are important:</span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span dir=LTR><span>Racism played a big role in the law of rape. Recall, for example, the Scottsboro
case. Rape carried the death penalty for
a number of years, but the only states that carried the death penalty were
Southern states, and the only people who were ever executed for rape were
non-white defendants who were convicted of raping white women. In Southern states, rape was used as a tool
to ensure racial segregation.</span></span></p>

name of the crime because they hoped to get rid of the ideas that were linked
to the crime. That has failed
completely, according to Dressler. After
a while, feminists decided that they want to send the message that rape is
different from assault and battery, and that in fact it is something more. In any case, most contemporary rape statutes
don’t call rape “rape”.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span dir=LTR><span>This is a controversial area and the law is in deep
flux. Should the law merely reflect our
current values, or should the law try to change things? Dressler seems to be definitely in favor of
judicial activism. Should the criminal
law be active? If a man has committed an
act that is rape according to the law even though society at large does not
believe the act to be rape? Is there a
due process/legality problem here? In
other words, if the legislature is <i>ahead</i> of culture, should we let statutes
trump culture?</span></span></p>

to make it easier and easier to punish men for rape. More and more sexual acts are being
incorporated into the definition of rape. Has the law gone far enough, or has it gone too far? Has the pendulum swung too far in the other
direction?</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Dressler
wants to suggest that in some areas the law has gone too far. Back at the time of the Oklahoma City
bombing, Bill Clinton moved to broaden the powers of the FBI. A similar thing happened with 9/11 and Bush and
the Patriot Act. All of the sudden,
people in the Senate started talking about the importance of civil
liberties. Orrin Hatch and Jesse Helms
were suddenly arguing for civil liberties because they were afraid that the “left-wing”
in power would use government power to fight the NRA and other “right-wing”
organizations. The legislation failed,
and Bill Clinton didn’t get what he wanted.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Dressler
suggests that in rape law, there is no such “yin and yang”. It’s totally lopsided. On the one hand, you have conservative
law-and-order types who want harsher laws. On the other hand, you have feminists on the left who want more power to
prosecutors to fight rape. Both sides
are on the same end of the issue. Dressler’s
article in the Cleveland State Law Review<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2'
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

suggests that some things have gone too far and some things have not gone far
enough.</span></p>

<p><b><span><br>
</span></b><span>Consider
murder, kidnapping, and rape. Where does
rape fit in with murder and kidnapping? What is the most serious? What is
the least serious? Does it depend on the
individual case? It is suggested that
rape is more serious than kidnapping. Is
kidnapping an offense that will have life-long emotional trauma? Also, kidnapping involves harm to more
people.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the other hand, how might we argue that rape is worse than murder? Rape involves a loss of happiness over time.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about the social harm? There is arguably
greater harm to society as a whole from murder than from rape.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In <i>Coker
v. Georgia</i>, the Supreme Court found that you may not execute a rapist based
on the Eighth Amendment.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Could
kidnapping a child be worse than some rapes?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
is the underlying social harm of rape? Even among feminists, you will see disagreement. What is special about rape that makes it
different from, for example, being slugged in the face?</span></p>

<p><span>How
do we time-frame the threat as it relates to the sex act? What in the case makes the time-framing a big

they must be suggesting that anything said on June 14 doesn’t count.</span></p>

it was <i>very hard</i> to convict a man of rape.</span></p>

<p><span>Blaming
the victim – we know the victims get blamed frequently for their own rape. However, this is not exclusively a phenomenon
related to rape. It’s part of the desire

to us.</span></p>

study showed that women don’t think there should be different punishment for

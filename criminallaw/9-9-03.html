      <p>
        <span
          >The issue with <i>mens rea</i> goes to <i>social harm</i>. If I pull
          the trigger of a gun and someone runs in front of the gun, I may have
          had the <i>intent to pull the trigger</i>, but I didn�t have the
          <i>intent to harm the person</i>. <i>Mens rea</i> speaks to the latter
          form of intent. Think: �<i>Mens rea</i> = thought about harm, NOT
          thought about act�.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Today, we�ll make an important distinction between the �culpability�
          meaning and the �elemental� meaning of <i>mens rea</i>. Note 1 on page
          132 is one of the most important notes in the casebook. Whenever you
          talk about <i>mens rea</i>, think about whether you mean the
          �culpability� meaning or the �elemental� meaning.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Would retributivists favor a <i>mens rea</i> requirement in the law?
          Yes. They would be offended by a justice system that punishes without
          finding a person blameworthy. Retributivists believe you need both
          blameworthiness and social harm in order for punishment to rightly
          follow.</span

      <p>
        <span

          would punishing a person without intent change the incentives of

          But the appellate court tells us that the jury instructions were

          It should have used the modern understanding of the term �malice�,
          that is:</span

          committed with <i>intent</i> or <i>recklessness</i>. Did Cunningham

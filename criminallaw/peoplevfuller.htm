<p><i><span>People
v. Fuller</span></i></p>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Court of Appeal, Fifth District, 1978.</span></span><span></span></p>

<p><span>86
Cal.App.3d 618, <span class=GramE>150 <span class=SpellE>Cal.Rptr</span></span>.

pp. 286-287</span></p>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Some guys were stealing tires
by breaking into cars and got spotted by the cops. They tried to get away in their car and got
into an accident, killing a bystander. They were charged with felony murder based on the felony of burglary. The trial court struck down the murder count.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, can the defendants be
charged with first degree murder under the felony-murder rule?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> Under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, all murder that is
committed while committing another felony is considered first degree murder.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court is very reluctant
to apply the felony-murder rule here, but they do so “[s]<span class=SpellE>olely</span>
by force of precedent”. It is rather
simple for the court to find that this case falls under the felony-murder rule,
but the court thinks this is the wrong result. The court believes that the defendants should not be held responsible for
murder because their illegal activity, stealing tires, is not inherently “dangerous
to human life”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The trial court’s dismissal
of the murder charge is reversed.</span></p>

this court stretches the plain language of the law, the more likely it is to
get reversed. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Judges <i>hate</i> getting
reversed. But I think the best shot for
the defendants at trial would be to argue that this wasn’t murder in the first
place based on § 187 because there was no malice. The felony-murder statute in </span></span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> is just that: a <i>murder </i>statute,
not a felony-<i>homicide</i> statute. If
the defendants could argue that they did not have an “abandoned and malignant
heart”, and that thus this wasn’t murder, then it can’t be <i>felony</i>
murder.</span></p>

      <p><span>Dressler, pp. 201-204</span></p>

      <p>
        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The defendant and another man robbed the victim and left him out on
          the highway where he was later struck by a car. The defendant was
          found guilty of murder and appealed on the basis that the court did
          not allow the jury to consider whether he caused the death of the
          victim.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the trial court err in failing to instruct the jury with respect
          to the issue of causation?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          By statute, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
          defendant <i>caused</i> the victim�s death.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The definition of causation is complex, and the court finds it was
          essential that the jury be provided with such a definition.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court found that the trial judge had given the jury incomplete
          instructions and thus had violated the defendant�s right to due
          process.</span

            example: �In other for you to convict the defendant of murder, you
            must find that it has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the

            >Under <i>Kibbe</i>, I believe P would have been found to be a
            proximate cause of V�s death because her traveling to her parents�
            house was a response to P�s violent behavior. The doctrine of
            contributory negligence would hold that V�s choice to fall asleep
            outside in freezing weather may lessen the chance that P caused V�s
            death. On the other hand, since P apparently wished to kill V, the
            doctrine of intended consequences suggests that since P got what he
            wanted, he caused it to happen. The safety that is described here
            must be safety from the defendant rather than safety in general. I
            tend to side with the doctrine of intended consequences and thus I
            would disagree with the result in this case. I don�t think it would
            make a difference whether or not P was searching for V, but I think
            it would matter whether P�s threat was genuine, although it would be
            difficult to know. The wife batterer aspect could go either way: you
            could say that it showed he was regularly violent towards his wife
            and thus it was more likely he truly intended to kill her, but on
            the other hand, you might argue that if he was going to kill her he
            would have done so already, and, though it�s despicable, that what
            he really likes is just to beat her up.</span

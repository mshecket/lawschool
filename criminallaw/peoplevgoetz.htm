        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Goetz shot four men on the subway. He claimed he did it in
          self-defense because he thought the men were going to rob him. He was
          charged with attempted murder and other charges, and he moved to
          dismiss the charges on the basis of the prosecutor�s instructions to
          the Grand Jury in regard to the justification defense. The trial court
          dismissed the charges, and the intermediate appellate court upheld the
          dismissal.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Is the �reasonable person� standard for self-defense as justification
          an objective standard or a subjective standard?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span> The reasonable person standard is an objective standard.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that the prosecutor accurately articulated the
          standard to the Grand Jury.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The court reinstates all counts of the indictment.</span>

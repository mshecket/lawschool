        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          McCoy and Lakey were convicted of first-degree murder in a drive-by
          shooting. McCoy�s conviction was overturned. The Court of Appeal found
          that Lakey�s conviction cannot stand because he would be guilty of a
          higher offense than the actual perpetrator.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Can an aider and abettor be found guilty of a greater homicide offense
          than the actual perpetrator?</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          If an aider or abettor helps or induces someone to kill, that
          individual�s guilt is based on the combination of the actus </span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          An aider or abettor doesn�t require the same mental state as the
          actual perpetrator. Actually, the aider or abettor must have the same
          or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">greater</i> mens rea than
          the perpetrator. If the two actors are held accountable for the same
          act, but one (the aider or abettor) is found to have a more culpable
          mental state than the other (the actual perpetrator) then it is
          appropriate to punish the former more seriously than the latter.</span

<p><b><i><span><a
href="baileyvcommonwealth.htm">Bailey v. Commonwealth</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Bailey
is charged with involuntary manslaughter, which requires the mens rea of criminal
negligence. Bailey tries to argue his
way out of criminal liability. What’s
his argument that puts the case in this section of the book? Bailey argues that he can’t be the principal
in the first degree because he didn’t kill ‘<span class=SpellE>em</span>. The government concedes that Bailey is not a principal
in the second degree or an accessory before the fact, so there’s apparently
nothing left.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
is Bailey not a principal in the second degree? He wasn’t at the scene of the crime. What about accessory before the fact? He didn’t do any preplanning with the officers. The whole idea of derivative liability is a
sense of <i>agency</i>. The reason why
an accomplice derives liability from the perpetrator is that because of their
relationship, you can say “Your act is my act. Your killing is my killing. When
you commit a crime, I’ll have to take responsibility too.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
can Bailey be a principal in the first degree? They use the “innocent instrumentality” doctrine. They say that Bailey isn’t an accomplice, but
rather, he is the actual perpetrator. You can be the principal in the first degree even if you don’t pull the
trigger if you use an innocent dupe. The
police officers are sort of like a pit bull that you sic on someone.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Some
would argue that a gun is an innocent instrumentality. The police officers had no mens rea.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Or,
say you point a gun at someone and you tell them that you will kill them unless
they rob a bank. That person will be
excused because of duress. If the
coercer coerced somebody, we let the coerced person off, and the coercer gets
convicted for the crime.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
would this case be decided under the Model Penal Code? § 2.06(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) gets us
there. There are two ways we’ve looked
at where you can be held responsible for the conduct of another: you can be an accomplice,
or you can cause an innocent person to carry out your evil deeds for you.</span></p>

<br/>

<p  style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span>(2) A person is legally accountable for the conduct
of another person when:</span></b></p>

<p  style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span>(a) <span class=GramE>acting</span> with the kind of
culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the offense, he causes an
innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct.</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Innocent
means someone who would lack the mens rea for the crime or would be excused
from the crime. Irresponsible more or
less means insane.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if Murdock had killed one of the officers before getting killed by the
police? Would Bailey be guilty of criminal
homicide of the officer? Say we’re the prosecutors. We know we want to get Bailey.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Can
we make Murdock an innocent instrumentality? What will the defense say? We
might say that Murdock isn’t innocent after all. Would we have been able to punish Murdock for
killing the police officer if he had survived?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Could
we make a claim for self-defense for Murdock? Does Murdock have a valid self-defense claim? It seems that Murdock put himself into the
situation. He could have stayed in the
house. Maybe we can make Murdock an
aggressor. The common law and the Model
Penal Code say that if you don’t have an obligation to be in a place where you’re
at risk, you can’t claim self-defense.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>You
can make a strong case that Murdock is protected in his house but he’s not
covered by self-defense outside of his house. He picked up a gun and when outside to deal with the alleged threat.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
assume, <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>arguendo</span></span><span
class=GramE>, that</span> we could make a justifiable claim that Murdock was
allowed to come outside. What’s another
obstacle to Murdock winning his self-defense claim? We would need to show that Murdock could
reasonably conclude that he is about to be subject to an unlawful deadly
threat. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We will give him his defense if
his belief is reasonable. However, if it’s
an unreasonable belief, then you lose the defense. As a prosecutor, we would think that Murdock
is not only the aggressor, but also that his belief is unreasonable. If we could convict Murdock of a crime, we
can’t use the innocent instrumentality argument.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Are
we prepared to say that Bailey was Murdock’s accomplice? No way! They didn’t have a common goal. Why can’t Bailey be the accessory before the fact to Murdock? The two people must have common motives and a
common design. Bailey and Murdock are <i>enemies
of each other</i>. They have <i>antagonistic</i>
purposes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
can’t get Bailey as an accomplice and we can’t get them through the innocent
instrumentality doctrine. But we think
that Bailey’s <i>own conduct</i> was the cause of the harm. § 2.06(1) says that you can be held
responsible for a crime based on <i>your own conduct</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p  style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span>(1) A person is guilty of an offense if it is
committed by his own conduct or by the conduct of another person for which he
is legally accountable, or both.</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
might be a proximate cause issue here. Don’t do proximate causation analysis in criminal law the way you did it
in Torts.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>You
<span class=SpellE>gotta</span> come up with something. You make do with what you’ve got.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span>State
v. Hayes</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
is it that Hill is not guilty of the burglary and larceny charges for which the
government has charged Hayes? Hill has
no mens rea. He had no intent to commit
either crime. He was just trying to trap
Hayes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
why does Hayes get off? There’s no liability
to derive from! Hill didn’t commit a
crime.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
can’t get Hayes on the innocent instrumentality doctrine, because Hill
manipulated Hayes rather than vice versa.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
if you’re Hill and you want Hayes convicted, you help Hayes go through the
window.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
could we get Hayes for under the Model Penal Code given these events? We could get him for solicitation. But there’s also something that we can get
him for. We could convict him of <i>attempted
burglary</i>…really,<i> attempting to aid and abet a burglary</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
can also get him for larceny at common law or under the Model Penal Code. These days, with penal codes that get thicker
and thicker and thicker, there’s usually a way to convict a person of a crime
if you are creative enough.</span></p>

<p><st1:country-region><st1:place><b><i><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>United States</span></i></b></st1:place></st1:country-region><b><i><span> v. Lopez</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
was a TV movie!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>“Intolerable
prison condition” claims: a person escapes prison and tries to avoid conviction
for the break based on the conditions in the prison. It makes sense if the prison is on fire to
try to escape because it’s necessity.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
was a case involving a serious diabetic who wasn’t getting his insulin. He escapes because he feels that he’ll go
into diabetic shock if he doesn’t get his insulin. He was prosecuted for escape. There was a prison where the heat went off
and some prisoners escaped claiming cold as an intolerable prison condition.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are a lot of these cases. The defendant,
even if they win their case, will get sent back to prison to serve out the term
they were already serving.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> calls this claim duress. </span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Duress
is an excuse, necessity is a justification. This has some relevance to Lopez. Necessity is balancing evils from a societal perspective. If we’re going to balance those evils, we
would take into account whether Lopez will be dangerous on the outside. Is she a serial killer, or is she a car
thief? If she’s a serial killer, we’d
rather use duress rather than necessity.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
we’re not interested in her, we’re interested in McIntosh. It definitely matters to him whether Lopez’s defense
is characterized by justification or excuse. Justifications are “universal” and excuses are “personal”. If we believe that Lopez’s leaving the prison
was justified, then McIntosh becomes the accomplice in a <i>justified</i> act,
that is, something we think is <i>good</i> not <i>bad</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
if what Lopez did was wrong though excusable, then we say something bad has
happened. We’ll excuse her because her
life was at risk, but we won’t excuse him because <i>his</i> life wasn’t at
risk. We will say that something bad has
happened that someone must pay for.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Or
suppose Lopez escapes but is not liable because she’s insane. Is there any reason McIntosh should be able
to benefit from her insanity? <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>No way!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Dressler
says that this case is great because this judge realizes that this is the
issue.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the Lopez case, McIntosh would be convicted as an accomplice of a crime that occurred
but is “invisible” to us because we’re letting her off on the grounds of
duress. She intended to escape. We’re just letting her off because of her
excuse. McIntosh is not using Lopez as
an instrumentality.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A statute
might be drafted in a way that only a certain kind of person can be convicted
of the crime, for example, an inmate. Under that theory, only an inmate can be a principal in the first degree. Other jurisdictions just say we don’t care.</span></p>

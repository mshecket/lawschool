        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The parents of a child who died of an infection they failed to treat
          were charged with manslaughter based on their negligence. They were
          convicted and they appealed.</span

          ><st1:place><span>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >, manslaughter is any homicide that is not murder but is neither
          justifiable nor excusable and is committed with <i>simple</i> (as
          opposed to <i>gross</i>) negligence. Furthermore, homicide is
          excusable if it is committed accidentally while �doing any lawful act
          by lawful means, with ordinary caution�.</span

        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that the defendants were put on notice that the baby
          was sick before it was too late to save the baby by taking him to a
          doctor. The court does not accept the excuse of the defendants that
          they thought if they took the baby to a doctor he would be taken away
          by the welfare department. Therefore, the court finds there was enough
          evidence to find that the parents committed simple negligence.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The court upheld the manslaughter conviction.</span>

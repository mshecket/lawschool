            In practice, we usually say that �ignorance of the law is no
            excuse�. I don�t think we�re on safe ground if we predicate that
            principle on the fact that we publish a list of all the crimes in a
            big book. I think when people use this
            <span class="GramE">phrase,</span> they mean that you should have
            known that what you were doing was wrong whether or not you ever
            looked at statutes. If there wasn�t prior case law on the
            �abominable crime� statute, it would be hard to argue that
            reasonable people would know what the heck they were talking about.

            It also makes you wonder if you could challenge a law on the books
            simply because it�s so old and obscure that nobody remembers it.
            Maybe it would be desirable for the sake of notice to have all
            criminal statutes expire after, say, twenty years, at which point
            they must be considered again. Hopefully, the public would then take
            more interest in the statutes and become more aware of their
            contents.</span

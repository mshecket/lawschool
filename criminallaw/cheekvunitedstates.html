        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Cheeks didn�t pay his taxes. He was indicted for failing to file and
          tax evasion. In his defense, he argued that he sincerely believed he
          didn�t have to pay his taxes and thus he acted without the
          <i>mens rea</i> required for the crimes. Cheeks was found guilty and
          he appealed to the Seventh Circuit, which upheld his conviction, and
          subsequently to the United States Supreme Court.</span

          Does an honest but unreasonable belief negate willfulness?</span

        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          A claimed good-faith belief need not be reasonable in order to be
          considered as a defense.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Court cites <i>United States v. Murdock</i> and later cases to
          establish that �willfully� in the tax code should be taken to mean
          �voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty�. The Court
          says that it is impossible to be aware that the law imposes a duty if
          at the same time you believe such a duty does not exist.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>It is argued that it is not
          required that such a belief be reasonable.</span

        <span
          >Blackmun dissents, saying that Cheek�s defense is barred by the fact
          that the Internal Revenue Code has been around so long and that he
          seeks to be mentally competent.</span

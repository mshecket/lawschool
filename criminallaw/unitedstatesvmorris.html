        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Morris wrote a worm that he meant to be harmless and released it on
          the Internet. It ended up causing damage that Morris did not foresee,
          including damage to federal computers. Morris was found guilty of
          intentionally accessing and causing loss to federal computers. Morris
          appealed on the basis that he didn�t intend to damage the computers
          and that the statute should be read to require intent to damage as
          well as intent to access.</span
        >

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Does the statute require the prosecution to prove that the defendant
          intentionally caused damage to federal
          <span class="GramE">computers,</span> or only that the defendant
          intentionally accessed federal computers and in doing so caused damage
          (in this case unintentionally)?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          One may be punished for damaging federal computers unintentionally if
          the damage resulted from intentional access to the computers.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          By way of a review of legislative history, the statute is interpreted
          to only require intent to access and not intent to damage. In
          particular, the court cites a change that was made which added the
          intent requirement in order to prevent convicting people of
          accidentally accessing someone else�s computer.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The conviction was upheld.</span>

            because he did not perform all the elements of the crime knowingly.
            He only accessed the computers knowingly. He did not cause damage
            knowingly. � 2.02(4) says that in the absence of clear language to

            of a �visual depiction� whose production �involves the use of a
            minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct�. The question is: what
            must be <i>done</i> �knowingly�, and what attendance circumstances
            must be �known� in order for a person to be guilty of the offense?
            It seems that the term �knowledge� applies to the act of
            �distribution�. You could come up with some
            <span class="SpellE">hypotheticals</span>, however, that would seem
            to demonstrate that the statute is ridiculous unless �knowledge�
            applies to the character of the depictions. The distributor might
            knowingly distribute what he thinks is a picture of the
          </span></span
        ><st1:place><span>Grand Canyon</span></st1:place
        ><span
          >, but it turns out that when the picture is treated with certain
          chemicals it reveals a depiction forbidden by statute. It seems,
          therefore, that �knowingly� must be taken to apply to the nature of
          the visual depiction involved.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>The latter is what the Supreme
          Court decided. You could also argue, however, that the statute writers
          were going for something closer to strict liability.</span

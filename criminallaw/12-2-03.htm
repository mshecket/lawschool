      <p><span>Four cases to cover today!</span></p>

      <br />

        <b><span>Presence</span></b>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Dressler goes into the bank and he�s waiting for the teller. I�m
          robbing the bank! He�s so surprised that I�m robbing the bank that he
          says: �<span class="SpellE">Geez</span>, I wonder if Shecket realizes
          there�s a camera in here!� or �I wonder if he notices the guard over
          there?� In response, I finish the robbery faster than I would have.
          But for Dressler�s having said it, I would have been caught. I�m
          guilty of robbery, but is Dressler guilty as an accomplice? He was at
          the scene and he assisted me: he was present and he assisted me, but
          he has no mens rea and thus gets off the hook.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if, on the other hand, Dressler wants me to get away with it and
          decides to help me, and in his mind he really means it, but doesn�t
          act in any way? If he is present and has the mens rea but doesn�t
          assist, he gets off the hook again.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the argument by the prosecutor for indicting the defendant?
          What exists in the case that justifies treating him as an
          accomplice?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s different between the facts here and the hypotheticals?
          <span class="SpellE">Vaillancourt</span> was talking to the primary
          offender. Also, the defendant came to the house with the primary
          defendant. That suggests that they didn�t just
          <i>happen to be there at the same time</i>, but actually
          <i>came there together</i>. That makes a somewhat stronger argument
          that they are more than just physically proximate to each other.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The crucial word in the indictment was �accompaniment�. The majority
          and minority both read a great deal into that word. What does it mean
          to accompany someone?</span

        ><span
          >You have to assist, and you have to have a mens rea. However,
          presence can frequently get us closer to the point where we can say
          that someone has assisted.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So what�s the extra <i>something </i>you have to have in order to be
          an accomplice?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Check out the problem on this case. Regarding the rapes�what is the
          liability, if any, of the cheering customers, non-cheering customers,
          and the bartender?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s talk about the bartender first. Can we get him as an accomplice
          in the rapes? For our current purposes, we�re focusing on actus </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place

          ></st1:City
        ><span>
          only. Does the bartender have a legal duty to act to prevent the rape?
          This person may be the only employee there. The bartender would seem
          to be responsible to protect his customers. Remember from torts the
          distinction between invitees and licensees? Well, it seems here that
          since this is a business and the victim was a customer, he owes a
          legal duty to her.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But the law is hesitant to punish
          <span class="SpellE">omitters</span>, because, among other reasons, it
          is difficult to determine mens rea from a failure to act than an act.
          It�s a lot easier to infer a mens rea when you fire a gun than when
          you fail to do something. What if the bartender froze up and couldn�t
          act? There are many ways to interpret non-action.
        </span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the non-cheering customers? Can we get them for the rape?
          Do they have a duty to prevent the crime? Based on what we�ve learned,
          no. If they have a duty to stop a crime, all of us have a duty to stop
          any crime that occurs in our presence. That may be a moral duty, but
          it�s not a legal duty under the criminal law. Think of Jeffrey
          <span class="SpellE">Strohmeyer</span>. He didn�t have a legal duty to
          stop his friend from raping a girl.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the cheering customers? Could you get them for
          encouragement? What if the rapists were deaf? Would that make a
          difference? Does this make any sense?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How do we explain <i>Wilcox</i>? How can Wilcox be deemed an
          accomplice while none of the other thousands of people at the
          auditorium are found to be accomplices? If Wilcox had booed,
          apparently he would have been off the hook.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There�s another problem here. Let�s assume that Wilcox is the only
          person who encouraged Hawkins and specifically encouraged him to break
          the law. But hadn�t the crime already happened? The crime started when
          Hawkins entered the country without the appropriate documentation.
          Wilcox didn�t assist in getting him into the country illegally. But by
          the time of the concert, it would seem that the crime has already
          occurred. Dressler assumes that this isn�t being discussed because
          this crime is viewed as a continuing crime. That is, every second
          Hawkins is in the country illegally, a crime continues and therefore
          anyone who helps at any time is an accomplice.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If we had deaf rapists, wouldn�t that make the cheering customers
          equal to the non-cheering customers when it comes to the actus </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place
            ><span class="GramE"><span>reus</span></span></st1:place
          ></st1:City
        ><span>? Sure.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s say we�re all at the OSU-Wisconsin game and we all cheer Robert
          Reynolds as he chokes Jim <span class="SpellE">Sorgi</span> in such a
          manner that it�s clearly beyond the scope of the game and actually
          constitutes a crime. Are the fans who are cheering accomplices?
          Criminal law is all about individual liability. Would it be
          appropriate for an attorney representing one of the cheering fans to
          say to a prosecutor: �You need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
          Robert Reynolds heard <i>my</i> client�s cheering in particular�?
          Would that be a legitimate argument?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The policy argument is that if the prosecutor is forced to use that
          standard of proof, they won�t be able to nap anybody. We shouldn�t let
          people off just because they�re in a big mob that all does the same
          thing at the same time.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If I can�t prosecute because I can�t separate out the 85,000 people,
          it may be that the correct answer ought to be �tough� because that�s
          what the burden of proof and presumption of innocence is all about.
          But what is the message we learn from <i>Wilcox</i> and
          <span class="SpellE"><i>Helmenstein</i></span> about how much
          assistance is needed to be an accomplice?
          <span class="GramE">Very little indeed.</span></span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The defense is not able to argue successfully that �this crime would
          still have occurred even if my client hadn�t applauded�. The law does
          not require a �but-for� causal connection between the assistance and
          the crime. It�s enough that you�ve assisted, even in some extremely
          trivial way. <i>But,</i> you must, in fact, have assisted. If I don�t
          <i>actually</i> assist, I�m not an accomplice.</span

        ><span>
          cannot be had on the testimony of an accomplice unless that testimony
          is corroborated by a non-accomplice. The accomplice has an ulterior
          reason to testify against his fellow accomplices. In multi-party
          crimes, the prosecution will go after the little guy and try to get
          them to cheese them out. Then the accomplice has the incentive to say,
          �Just tell me what to say, and I�ll say it.� Accomplices have their
          own reasons to lie or make it look like the other guy did more than
          him. Many jurisdictions say there must be <i>something</i> to confirm
          the testimony of an accomplice.</span

          <i>also</i> a co-conspirator. There is both accomplice liability and
          conspiracy liability. Both would get a person within this special

        ><span> police officer tried to get </span

          ><st1:place><span>Genoa</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          involved in a purported scheme to buy cocaine. The cop says: �Give me

          ><st1:place><span>Genoa</span></st1:place></st1:City

          <i>at common law</i> you need to derive your liability from some
          underlying crime; that�s what accomplice liability is all about. Since
          the cop committed no crime, there is no crime to be an accomplice to.
          If the social harm of the crime or of the attempt hasn�t happened,
          there�s nothing to get the accomplice for. There must be something

          objectivist way of looking at it, there is no social harm and </span

          ><st1:place><span>Genoa</span></st1:place></st1:City

        <span>The Model Penal Code says: </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Genoa</span></st1:place
          ></st1:City
        ><span>
          <i>tried to be an accomplice</i>. So under the Model Penal Code, we
          ask:
          <i
            >would this person have been an accomplice under � 2.06 had a crime
            been committed?</i
          >
          If the answer is yes, then you can be guilty
          <i>not as an accomplice</i> but as the
          <i>perpetrator of the attempt</i>. </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Genoa</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          becomes the principal in the first degree of the <i>attempt</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Can we do � 5.01(3) with solicitation and not just aid? In � 2.06,
          solicitation is in a different subcategory from aiding. � 5.01(3)
          <span class="GramE">seems</span> to deal only with <i>aid</i> and not
          <i>solicitation</i>. Is this a glitch? Is this inconsistent? Well, you
          could still be guilty of <i>solicitation</i> to commit a crime, which
          is usually as serious as the completed crime anyway.
          <span class="GramE">So, no problem really.</span> Doesn�t really
          matter.</span

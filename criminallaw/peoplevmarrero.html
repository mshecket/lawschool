<p><span>Court
of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, 1987.</span></p>

<p><span>69
N.Y.2d 382, 515 N.Y.S.2d 212, 507 N.E.2d 1068.</span></p>

<p><span>Dressler,
pp. 177-184</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The defendant was a prison
guard in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Connecticut</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and was arrested in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> for possession of an
unlicensed firearm. The defendant
claimed that he thought he was allowed to carry the gun because he was a “peace
officer” by the definition contained in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statutes. The trial judge dismissed the indictment, but
an appellate court reversed the dismissal and thus barred the defendant from
arguing he was exempt from criminal liability under the statute. He was convicted at trial and appealed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Should the defendant have
been convicted even though he was mistaken in regard to the law?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> Mistake in regard to law
may negate intent but it is not a defense to a strict liability crime.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court interprets the
New York Penal Code to include the Model Penal Code treatment of “ignorance or
mistake”. Overall, the court construes
the mistake of law defense narrowly on <a href="utilitarianjustifications.html">utilitarian</a>
grounds and cautioning against the slippery-slope policy implications of
allowing a broader version of the defense.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
a dissenting opinion, Hancock employs <a href="retributivejustifications.html">retributivist</a>
arguments, along with a smattering of specific deterrence language, to argue
against the majority’s narrow construction of mistake of law. Hancock’s main point is that it is wrong to
punish someone who is not blameworthy. Hancock alleges that punishing people despite good faith mistake is
tantamount to punishing a law-abiding person.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Hancock
says that the maxim “Ignorance is no excuse” comes from Medieval times when
people were commonly found guilty of crimes without intent. The judge says that over time, retributivism
has become more accepted and utilitarianism less so, such that crimes by and
large now require a guilty mind. Hancock
claims, however, that the maxim has hung around as mere dogma.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Hancock
raises the question of whether the interpretation of the majority went against
the “Rule of Lenity”. Hancock also
claims that the legislature clearly intended the opposite result that the
majority claims.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The verdict was upheld.</span></p>

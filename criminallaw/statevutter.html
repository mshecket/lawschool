        <b><span>Facts: </span></b
        ><span
          >The defendant�s son was seen entering their apartment. The son was
          heard to say �Dad, don�t� and then was seen in the hallway of the
          building, stabbed in the chest. He said �Dad stabbed me� and then
          died. The defendant was charged with second degree murder and
          convicted of manslaughter. He appealed on the basis of a �conditioned
          response� theory that was barred by the trial court.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue: </span></b
        ><span
          >Should the trial court have instructed the jury to ignore the
          evidence about conditioned response?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule: </span></b
        ><span
          >The theory should have been presented to the jury if there was
          sufficient evidence to support it.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court feels that the defendant makes an appropriate argument, at
          least in theory. If homicide requires an �act�, and an �act� is
          implicitly a �voluntary act�, then it follows that the killing of
          Utter�s son must be found to be voluntary in order to be found to
          constitute homicide.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court finds, however, that there is insufficient evidence in the
          record for the jury to consider whether or not the defendant was
          conscious or acting voluntarily at the time of the killing.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion: </span></b
        ><span
          >The court affirmed the trial court�s verdict (according to the full
          version of the case).</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Navarro wants a certain jury instruction that basically says if he
          made a good faith mistake he should be acquitted, even if it was
          entirely unreasonable. The judge did not accept this jury instruction,
          but rather told the jury to acquit only if the mistake was
          reasonable.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >If the belief was unreasonable, did he act in a morally culpable
          manner? We would more or less be saying he was negligent. There would
          be a <i>mens rea</i>, and thus <i>some</i> level of culpability. Why
          did the court reverse the verdict? He lacked the specific intent
          required for the crime. Moral culpability is general intent.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What would Model Penal Code � 2.04 say about this case? It says
          either the mistake does or does not negate the required
          <i>mens rea</i> for the crime. If the <i>mens rea</i> is the �intent�
          or �purpose� to steal, and the mistake proves that the defendant did
          not have such a purpose, then the defendant must be acquitted. The
          Model Penal Code rules!</span

      <p>
        <span

      <p>
        <span
          >The first thing to do when you�re in a non-Model Penal Code
          jurisdiction is to ask: is it a general intent, specific intent, or
          strict liability crime? If it�s strict liability, you�re done. Intent
          doesn�t matter, and thus mistake doesn�t matter.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If you have a specific intent crime, you ask if the mistake relates
          to the specific intent portion of the crime. In the case of Navarro,
          his mistake directly relates to his intent to steal. This being the
          case, we use the so-called �elemental� analysis. Does Navarro�s
          mistake of fact negate the specific intent element of the offense?
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>In this case, we may well
          argue that it does.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If you have a general intent crime, then at common law you must apply
          a �culpability� analysis. You must ask whether the defendant�s state
          of mind was blameworthy, and in particular you must ask whether or not
          their mistake, and in turn their behavior, was reasonable.</span

          reasonable mistake means there is no culpability. However, the

          through the eyes of the defendant and assume the facts as the
          defendant himself understood them. This doctrine says that if the
          defendant acted immorally, it is reasonable for him to assume the risk
          that the circumstances are different from what he thinks they are and
          thus be found guilty of some crime. Here, we end up asking: are you a

          facts were not as he believed them to be, and be found guilty of a
          more serious crime. It can be argued that this is unjust, because he

<p><span>Court
of Appeal, Sixth District, 1989.</span></p>

<p><span>208
Cal.App.3d 783, 256 Cal.Rptr. 344</span></p>

<p><span>Dressler,
pp. 266-271</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Berry</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> had a fighting pit bull
chained to a fence near some marijuana plants. The dog killed a toddler. The defendant
was charged with murder. He sought to
have the charge dismissed on the basis that the evidence presented fell short
of “implied malice”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Is the evidence in the case
sufficient to justify a murder charge against the defendant? In particular, does the evidence show that
the defendant exhibited an extreme indifference to the value of human life?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> “The test of implied malice…is
actual appreciation of a high degree of risk that is objectively present.” In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the defendant must be
shown to have had a knowledge of the “high degree of risk”, or in other words,
they must be shown to be <i>reckless</i>, in order to be charged with murder as
opposed to manslaughter.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court cites several
facts which taken together it suggests are sufficient to show recklessness:</span></p>

kept the dog chained to a fence.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The court concludes that
there is sufficient evidence that the defendant knew the dog could harm human
beings. The court allows the murder case
to go to trial.</span></p>

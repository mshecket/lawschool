        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Two teenagers had intercourse. Their testimony differed on many facts.
          It generally appeared, however, that the intercourse was
          non-consensual and was accomplished without the use of force as
          �traditionally� defined. The defendant was tried and found delinquent
          for second-degree sexual assault, but the delinquency was reversed on
          appeal. The State appealed to the Supreme Court of New Jersey.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Is any force required besides the force of sexual intercourse itself
          to find the defendant delinquent for second-degree sexual
          assault?</span

          <i>affirmative</i> and <i>freely-given</i> <i>permission</i> of the
          victim�constitutes the offense of sexual assault. Therefore, physical
          force in excess of that inherent in the act of sexual penetration is
          <i>not required</i> for such penetration to be unlawful.�</span

          law in light of its legislative history, the court applies the law to
          the facts. The court considers the totality of the evidence in
          answering the question: �Did the alleged victim <i>freely</i> give
          <i>affirmative permission</i> to this specific act of sexual
          penetration?�</span

            >It would seem that Berkowitz�s conduct would constitute rape under
            <i>M.T.S.</i> because it was non-consensual sex. On the other hand,
            M.T.S.�s conduct would not seem to constitute rape under
            <i>Berkowitz</i>. I�m strongly invited to prefer the
            <i>M.T.S.</i> approach as a matter of social policy. I�m worried,
            though, that these are close cases and broadening the definition of
            rape will have a chilling effect on positive intimate sexual
            relationships. This is all getting dangerously close to saying that
            sex is inherently bad, or it is presumed bad, or that it is presumed
            that nobody wants it just like nobody wants to get robbed or beat
            up.</span

            The court recognizes that most non-criminal sex occurs without
            explicit verbal consent, and thus it would be bad policy to require
            such explicit consent as opposed to the somewhat broader �freely
            given affirmative permission�.</span

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Nations owns a disco where police officers found an underage girl
          dancing for tips. Nations was charged with child endangerment and was
          found guilty.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the state show that the defendant acted knowingly in endangering
          the welfare of a child?</span

        ><span>
          for not adopting the Model Penal Code in full. The court suggests that
          if the state wanted Nations to be convicted in this case, they should
          either have made the standard of culpability �recklessness� instead of
          �knowledge� for the offense of child endangerment, or else they should
          have had a provision incorporating so-called �wilful blindness� as a
          version of knowledge.</span

            >The court seems to equate �high probability� with �substantial and
            unjustifiable risk�. Furthermore, the court equates �awareness� with
            100% certainty. According to the footnotes, the Model Penal Code
            treats �wilful blindness� as a form of knowledge in order to settle
            the question of whether it falls under the category of �knowledge�
            or �recklessness�. The Model Penal Code treats it as a matter of
            knowledge because when a finder of fact infers knowledge, the
            evidence they have is �proof of notice of substantial probability of
            [a fact�s] existence�. �Wilful blindness� to existing facts, the
            drafters argue, can only be proven the same way.</span

            suggests that Nations was deliberately avoiding the age issue. Under
            Model Penal Code � 2.02(7), if Nations knew there was a high
            probability that the dancer was underage, she would be found to have
            �knowledge� of this fact and would be guilty.</span

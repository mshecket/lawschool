        <span

          law don�t follow one particular test. Usually, a jurisdiction will use
          multiple versions of these tests. For the purposes of the exam and for
          purposes of being a lawyer in a non-Model Penal Code jurisdiction, you
          must be familiar with <i>all</i> the tests. The Model Penal Code has
          its own test, so you would use that test in a Model Penal Code
          jurisdiction.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >You will frequently see courts saying that the line between a
          non-attempt and an attempt is the line between preparation and
          perpetration. This is the thing courts will talk about most
          frequently. When you�re preparing, you�re not attempting. When you�re
          perpetrating, you�re attempting. But this is an admittedly useless
          standard.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Consider the facts as set out in Dressler, pp. 716-717. We will
          discuss the January 15<sup>th</sup> situation, steps 1-10. There is
          nothing intellectually inconsistent about convicting someone for two
          counts of attempted murder of the same person.</span

        <span
          >Who do we use in the probable desistence test? Is it an objective
          test or a subjective test? It�s usually viewed as an objective test.
          But what is the standard by which we judge the accused?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>

      <p>
        <span
          >In a Model Penal Code jurisdiction, there is a defense of
          �renunciation�. You must freely and completely give up your plan. If
          you�re an objectivist, what is your position? Should we recognize a
          defense of genuine abandonment of the criminal plan? The objectivist
          would reject the defense, while a subjectivist would accept the
          defense. If you have truly renounced your dangerous intentions, you
          are no longer dangerous or culpable.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The common law tends to be objectivist, while the Model Penal Code
          tends to be subjectivist.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We don�t want to find attempt too close to the mere �thinking� stage
          because that would be unjust, but we don�t want to find attempt to
          close to the �completion� stage because we want a shot at preventing
          the criminal conduct.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Nothing in the Model Penal Code requires that we figure out purpose
          merely from physical conduct. If somebody says, �I�m gonna kill X�, we
          want to see conduct that strongly corroborates their statement that
          they�re going to kill X.</span

          >But if any of the categories � 5.01(2<span class="GramE">)(</span>a)
          through (g) are present, it just means that it�s not legally
          permissible for a judge to hold that it�s not legally sufficient. To
          put it another way, if any of these factors are present, the case
          should go to a jury and it would be wrong to direct a verdict of
          acquittal for a defendant if they meet one of those categories and
          it�s strongly corroborative of criminal conduct.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The categories (a) through (g) are only for the judge. They are not
          read to the jury. The jury only hears the �substantial step�
          language.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Model Penal Code is strongly distinguished from the common law in
          that most of the common law tests <i>look back</i> to see how close
          the defendant has come to completion. The Model Penal Code test asks
          how far the defendant has gone from the thought process. If the
          defendant has taken a substantial step towards committing the crime,
          even if <i>there is a lot more to be done</i>, you can convict.
          Therefore, it�s much easier to convict under the Model Penal Code than
          at common law.</span

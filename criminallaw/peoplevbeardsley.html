        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that Burns was not Beardsley�s wife or child and
          Beardsley was not Burns�s custodian or caretaker. The court notes that
          Burns was an adult and cavorted with Beardsley of her own free will.
          The court suggests that there would be no question of a legal duty if
          the principals in this case had been two men. It should not make a
          difference, it is argued, that the victim was a woman. The court
          concludes that Beardsley had no legal duty towards Burns.</span

            If the court set up incentives such that everyone had the legal duty
            to help others upon pain of punishment, the potential �helplessly
            ill person� will in turn be given less incentive to help themselves
            when they are likely to be the cheapest cost absorber in a given
            situation. I believe that if you accept Hughes�s argument, you must
            also accept that Beardsley would have to be held responsible for
            failing to come to the aid of a male drinking partner. I believe
            that this is bad policy, but that it is not as far fetched as the
            court would have us believe.</span

            >I believe this is a duty that could be appropriately imposed by
            statute, that is: if you have some connection to the apparent
            perpetrator of a crime, then you have some responsibility to
            intervene to help the victim. I don�t think Nix would have a duty to
            act if she was riding in a taxi and heard someone crying for help in
            the trunk, even if she was left alone in the taxi for a time.
            Generally, however, this is a situation where we would like to
            create a strong incentive for someone with the capacity to act to do
            so to prevent harm.</span

            >So omissions can be more ambiguous than actions. We don�t know
            where to draw the line between punishable and non-punishable
            omission. We also don�t want to encourage people to intervene when
            they might do more harm than good. A difference is asserted between
            positively <i>causing</i> <i>a harm</i> and negatively
            <i>withholding a benefit</i>. I don�t think we should punt on
            omission as an element of crime just because it�s difficult. We
            should draw the lines we can draw while assuring fair notice and
            lenity, but when the omission is clearly abhorrent to society (a
            <a href="retributivejustifications.html">retributivist</a>
            justification) or when an inexpensive act could prevent an
            excessively expensive harm (a
            <a href="utilitarianjustifications.html">utilitarian</a>
            justification), it ought to be a crime.</span

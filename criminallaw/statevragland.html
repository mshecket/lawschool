<p><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>State v. Ragland</span></i></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Supreme Court of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>New Jersey</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, 1986.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>105 N.J. 189, 519 A.2d 1361.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Facts:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> Ragland was convicted of several offenses. He appealed on the basis that the use of the phrase
“must find him guilty” in the jury instructions inappropriately precluded the
jury from its power of nullification, and that the jury’s power of
nullification was an essential aspect of his constitutional right to a jury
trial.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Issue:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> Must a jury be informed of its nullification power in
order for a verdict it returns to be valid?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Rule: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>There is no rule, which is why the court must make its
decision on the basis of policy.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Analysis: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>The court makes clear its view that jury nullification
is undesirable but unavoidable. It says
that the jury should only be informed of its nullification power if such
information would have a positive result in terms of policy. The court reasons that “advertising” jury
nullification will result in confusion, arbitrariness, and a slippery slope of
consequences involving the way attorneys and judges can and should address the
jury at trial.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Conclusion: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Juries ought not to be advised of their nullification
power. The verdict was reversed on other
grounds and a new trial was ordered.</span></p>

seems to base his reasoning on a different idea about juries than most people
have. He believes that the primary
purpose of the jury is “to prevent oppression by the Government”. In a way, Wiseman and Wilentz are really
talking about two totally different things. Wilentz says that it’s primarily not appropriate for the jury to
overrule the wisdom of the <i>legislature</i>, while Wiseman says it’s
important for the jury to act to control a potentially corrupt <i>judiciary</i>
as well as the legislature. Wiseman
focuses on the effects of jury nullification on particular unfair <i>cases</i>,
whereas Wilentz talks about juries nullifying whole <i>statutes</i>.</span></span></p>

would guess there is some rule that says the judge cannot lie. Would the case be overturned on appeal if the
judge said they did not have the power to nullify? Would the case be overturned on appeal if the
judge declined to answer the question? If the answer is yes to both questions, the judge seemingly must say
yes.</span></span></p>

think Leipold argues effectively against </span></span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Butler</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>’s proposal, but I don’t think Leipold adequately
disposes of the possibility of a jury making decisions based on cost-benefit
calculations. Let’s assume the jury can
get all the information that Leipold mentioned is important in his “technical
argument”. He gives as his <i>reductio
ad absurdum</i> the case of the wife-beater being acquitted by a jury. But his representation of the jury’s decision
making process is just a generic picture of nullification rather than a picture
of cost-benefit analysis. It just shows
the jury using arbitrary power rather than weighing the costs and benefits of
convicting the wife-beater. I think the
biggest weakness of Butler’s argument is that it suggests that either that
there are different rules of morality for African-Americans or that it is right
for <i>every</i> minority group to act to protect its interests against the
majority without regard to the law and without regard to the interests of other
groups. </span></p>

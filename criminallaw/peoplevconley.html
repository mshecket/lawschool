        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Conley hit a kid in the face with a wine bottle.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>The victim broke his jaw and
          permanent negative effects. Conley was found guilty of aggravated
          battery on the basis that the victim suffered permanent injury. The
          defendant appealed, arguing that the State failed to prove there was a
          permanent disability and that Conley intended to cause a permanent
          disability.</span

          law, someone intends to do something when that something is the
          conscious objective of his conduct. Someone does something knowingly
          when they are consciously aware that something is practically certain
          to happen based on his conduct.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court reasons that according to the aggravated battery statute, it
          must be proven that either it was the defendant�s goal to achieve a
          particular harm or that the defendant was �practically certain� that
          the harm would follow from his conduct. The court reasons that the
          circumstances taken in total suggest that the intent to cause
          permanent disability could be inferred.</span

            >This is very similar to the concept of transferred intent in
            intentional torts. Dressler and others argue that transferred intent
            is unnecessary to obtain a just result. They say that even if, for
            example, the human being killed was different than the human being
            the defendant intended to kill, the <i>actus </i></span
          ></span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place
            ><i><span>reus</span></i></st1:place
          ></st1:City
        ><span>
          and <i>mens rea</i> are still present under the common forms of the
          criminal homicide statute. The difficulty arises, Dressler argues,
          when you try to transfer intent not only between different victims,
          but different crimes. This holds in torts, but it is argued it ought
          not in criminal law. In the case where a defendant intends to kill a
          woman but instead causes the death of a fetus after it is born, there
          are some word problems. D intends to kill a human being. The fetus is
          not a human being (under, for example, </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          law) at the time of the stabbing. However, the fetus <i>is</i> a human
          being at the time of its death. I see this as analogous to a situation
          where D runs through X with a sword and doesn�t see Y standing behind
          X. Say X only gets wounded but Y gets killed. D should be convicted of
          intent-to-kill murder of Y. Therefore, by analogy, D should be
          convicted of intent-to-kill murder of the fetus. I don�t see a problem
          with this. If D intended to murder someone, and someone got murdered,
          and D was the cause of their death, then D should be convicted of
          their murder.</span

            >D could absolutely be convicted of two murders. Again, if D runs
            through X with a sword, and Y is standing behind X and D manages to
            kill both X and Y, D should be convicted of two murders. In the case
            where Y is merely wounded, D should be convicted of murder and
            attempted murder. In the other case, D should be convicted of
            attempted murder of X and murder of Y. If D intends to kill someone,
            I don�t think the consequences of D�s actions should have much
            bearing on D�s conviction and punishment. In fact, a utilitarian
            might make an argument that the penalty for attempted murder should
            be just as high as that for murder. If I was going to argue against
            the application of transferred intent, I would argue first that
            transferred intent is properly the realm of torts and should not be
            applicable to the criminal law. Next, I would make a retributivist
            argument that if D didn�t mean to do something to a particular
            person, D shouldn�t have to pay for what he did to that person.
            Finally, in terms of policy, I might argue that unbounded use of
            transferred intent would uncontrollably increase the number of
            prosecutable crimes and criminals and would overwhelm the justice
            system.</span

            >There are three types of �general intent/specific intent�
            dichotomies: (1) �General intent� may refer to an offense for which
            no particular mental state is mentioned in the statute. �Specific
            intent�, on the other hand, could refer to an offense that sets out
            a particular mental state as part of the crime. (2) �Specific
            intent� may also mean the <i>mens rea</i> element of �intent� or
            �knowledge�, whereas �general intent� may mean �recklessness� or
            �negligence�. (3) Furthermore, �general intent� may mean any mental
            state that only relates to the acts that constitute a crime, whereas
            �specific intent� would mean, in this case, a special mental element
            above and beyond the �general intent�. When you have a specific
            intent crime, there are typically three types: (1) intent to commit
            a future act, (2) proof of a special motive, and (3) proof of

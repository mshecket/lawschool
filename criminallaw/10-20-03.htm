      <p>
        <span>A couple of things to understand about the Estrich piece:</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This article was made into a book written for lay people. In the book
          version of this article, Estrich told the story of the fact that she
          herself had been raped. Estrich is on TV pretty frequently. She was
          the chairman for the presidential campaign for Michael Dukakis. She
          teaches now at USC.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Estrich distinguishes between �real� rape (the �easy� cases) and
          acquaintance or �date� rape. She argues that the public�s
          understanding of the two cases is rather different.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >MacKinnon almost says that all sex between men and women is coerced
          and therefore is rape. Estrich rejects this.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>She doesn�t take the radical
          view, and she doesn�t take the reactionary view either.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Shall we reject the resistance requirement of common law rape? Shall
          we moderate that requirement? If there is a genuine resistance
          requirement in the law, it is much easier to determine by law if a
          rape has occurred. If we remove the resistance requirement, it will be
          a lot harder to tell whether rape has occurred.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Estrich says that even some coerced intercourse may arguably not be
          criminalized.</span
        >

        <span>Maximalist � anything that is immoral should be criminal.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Minimalist � not everything that is immoral should be criminal; only
          the worst acts should be criminal.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Every year, the Penal Code gets thicker. We seem to be moving away
          from a minimalist approach. But no one would suggest that we�re
          approaching a maximalist approach. Dressler proposes that most people
          aren�t going to be upset by this. We all sometimes do things that are
          immoral.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >In this country, we do not treat morality and criminal law as exactly
          the same. In certain theocratic countries, it might be different. In
          the </span

          virtuous.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So, there is some behavior that men do that is wrongful and immoral
          but Estrich would not propose that such behavior should be
          criminal.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So when does proper conduct become wrongful conduct? Where does
          wrongful conduct reach criminal conduct? Where do we pass the line
          from a misdemeanor to a felony? Where do we pass between degrees? All
          this stuff will vary from state to state and is changing over
          time.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Estrich thinks that the burden should be on the woman to say �no�,
          but once she does, Estrich suggests that the act moves into the realm
          of rape.</span

        <span

          it�s (1). The state argues that since there is no consent,
          <i>any </i>force constitutes forcible compulsion. The state argues
          that her lack of consent is the only relevant fact. The law does not

      <p>
        <span

          read cues very differently. There is a lot of miscommunication between
          men and women about cues being given. There is thus a very important
          legal question: if a man reads a woman�s cues wrong, the man will be
          acting under a misunderstanding. There may be a mens rea mistake of
          fact issue. A reasonable mistake of fact is normally a defense to a
          general intent crime. Rape is a general intent crime.</span

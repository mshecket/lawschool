          defendant and asked her about the girl�s age. The defendant claimed

          >, knowledge means <i>awareness</i> of facts; here we�re talking about
          knowledge of an attendant circumstance. This is not the Model Penal
          Code formulation.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court says that the Model Penal Code is the source for the
          Missouri Criminal Code. If this were a Model Penal Code case, how
          could the prosecutor strengthen the argument that Nations did what she
          did <i>knowingly</i>? Model Penal Code � 2.02(7)
          <span class="GramE">tells</span> us that �<span class="SpellE"
            >wilful</span

          blindness� is tantamount to knowledge.</span

        <span
          >In the Model Penal Code, if the issue is whether a defendant had

          ><st1:place><span>Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          statute. But then you have to add on � 2.02(7), which adds to the
          meaning of the term �knowledge�. </span

          finds that the Model Penal Code is the source for their
          <span class="GramE">code,</span> however, the legislature of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Missouri</span></st1:place

          did not choose to include the �<span class="SpellE">wilful</span>
          blindness� provision in their version of the Code.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why did the Model Penal Code add this provision? We want to be able
          to hold people responsible for deliberately shielding themselves from
          knowledge that would otherwise go towards proving an offense.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We want to prevent the �ostrich phenomenon�. This is especially
          important for prosecutors of white collar crime cases. The higher-ups
          will protect themselves by prosecution by avoiding knowing the
          offenses being done to try to avoid prosecution. However, the �<span
            class="SpellE"
            >wilful</span
          >
          blindness� provision makes it less likely this stratagem will
          succeed.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What argument can be put forward again this �<span class="SpellE"
            >wilful</span
          >
          blindness� provision? It blurs the like between knowledge and
          recklessness. What is the mental state of a person who is aware of a
          high probability that, for example, a female dancer is under the age
          of 17? Isn�t that very similar to the definition of recklessness,
          which talks about disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk?
          Many critics say this provision is no good because it defies
          understanding what it means to �know� something when in fact you
          <i>don�t </i>know it.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If, on the other hand, you require <i>actual</i> knowledge, as in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >, it will be harder to get convictions in cases like this. We could
          attack <span class="GramE">this</span> two ways: we could knock down
          the standard of culpability in the statute to recklessness, or else
          you can, by statute, ratchet up the mental state of �<span
            class="SpellE"
            >wilful</span
          >
          blindness� to knowledge, as the Model Penal Code does.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court makes a mistake in this case. It reverses the terms in the
          Model Penal Code in an inappropriate way: the court says that there
          must be a �high probability� that the defendant was aware, whereas the
          Model Penal Code says that the defendant must be aware of a �high
          probability�. It wouldn�t have made a difference in this case,
          however, if you�re in a jurisdiction with a �<span class="SpellE"
            >wilful</span
          >
          blindness� provision, and a judge has stated the Model Penal Code �
          2.02(7) this way and you miss it, you could lose the case for your
          client.</span
        >

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>If Model Penal Code � 2.02(7) were in effect in </span

          ><st1:place><span>Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span

          guilty.</span

          necessary to resort to legislative history to clarify the statute�s
          intent.</span

      <br />

      <p>

          phrase with �intent� and the second bit that talks about �conduct�
          that �alters, damages, or destroys information�. As a lawyer, you must
          be very sensitive to language and how statutes are drafted.</span

          the �dual� use of intent, while this particular part of the statute
          there is just one �intent�. It is found that the use of the word
          intent was meant to limit punishment only to those who purposely
          access federal computers.</span

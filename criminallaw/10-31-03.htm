        <span>If </span

          ><st1:place><span>Norman</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          entitled to a self-defense claim? It rests on the meaning of the word
          �imminent�. At common law, this term means �just about
          <i>right now</i>�. We�re talking seconds, not minutes or hours or days
          or weeks. Since that�s not what we have in </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place
            ><i><span>Norman</span></i></st1:place
          ></st1:City
        ><span
          >, the Supreme Court of North Carolina represents the traditional
          view. Under the ruling of this case and in most common law
          jurisdictions, </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Norman</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          would not even be entitled to an <i>instruction</i> on the
          justification of self-defense.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The first significant battered woman case (where the victim kills the
          batterer in a non-confrontational situation) was known as the �burning
          bed case�. She poured gasoline on her husband and set him on fire.
          What would be a plausible defense other than self-defense? What about
          temporary insanity or diminished capacity? The thing that was done
          seems pretty kuh-razy.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The attorney was a private attorney, but the woman was not wealth.
          Women�s groups raised funds for her to pay the attorney. The women�s
          groups told the attorney that he shouldn�t claim insanity, but rather
          self-defense. The groups were sensitive to the distinction between
          justification and excuse. They understood the significance of that
          distinction intuitively. They didn�t want the woman to be seen as
          crazy. That�s an excuse for doing something <i>wrong</i>. The groups
          wanted the court to find that <i>she did the right thing;</i> that is,
          <i>she was justified</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Criminal law is, in a sense, a morality play, especially in cases
          like this. The jury represents the community�s values. They represent
          the judgment of the community as to whether the defendant�s conduct is
          right or wrong, above and beyond whether the defendant should be
          punished.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The women�s groups told the lawyer that they wouldn�t pay him unless
          he would plead self-defense. That�s a conflict of interest. The
          attorney considered doing self-defense, but didn�t. Later cases, like </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place
            ><i><span>Norman</span></i></st1:place
          ></st1:City
        ><span>, tried the self-defense route.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Pretend we don�t know of battered woman syndrome. Forget the law. Do
          we justify her conduct? Do we excuse her conduct?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One theory is that Mr. Norman did not deserve to live. That�s the
          moral forfeiture theory. What if he gets killed by a hit man? Dressler
          suggests that if you follow the moral forfeiture theory where it
          morally takes you, there must be no social harm in taking Mr. Norman�s
          life and thus no principled reason that it�s not okay for Judy or
          anyone else to do it.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p><span>Another theory is the moral rights theory.</span></p>

        <b><span>The Model Penal Code formulation of self-defense</span></b>

      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          >The Model Penal Code doesn�t focus on the amount of time before the
          actor will be killed, rather, it focuses on the actor to figure out if
          it is necessary <i>now</i> to use deadly force against the
          victim.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say Mr. Norman tells Mrs. Norman she�s going to leave the room and
          get a gun to kill her. Under common law, Mrs. Norman is defenseless
          until Mr. Norman actually gets the gun and points it at her. However,
          under the Model Penal Code, she would be justified in killing Mr.
          Norman before he gets the gun if she believes he�s going to kill her
          soon.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Even if there�s no battered woman syndrome, the fact that Mrs. Norman
          is a battered woman arguably should be admitted into evidence. The
          fact that she�s been beat up a lot makes her belief system more
          reasonable.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The law treats human life as almost <i>sanctified</i>. It doesn�t
          want innocent people to kill even <i>bad guys</i> unless absolutely
          necessary. That�s why there�s just a strong requirement that the
          threat to the defender be <i>imminent</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Compare to the situation with </span

          ><st1:place><span>Iraq</span></st1:place></st1:country-region
        ><span
          >�is pre-emption ever justified? Or was the threat framed as
          imminent?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Does syndrome evidence arguably turn a justification defense into an
          excuse?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >When we get in to the excuse defenses: are there any excuses that
          could be used to excuse Judy Norman?</span

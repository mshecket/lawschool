          >The defendant accosted the pregnant victim and shoved his knee in her
          abdomen, damaging the fetus and causing it to be stillborn. The
          defendant was charged with three criminal counts, including murder. In
          response the defendant filed a writ of prohibition to stop the
          proceedings.</span

        <b><span>Rules: </span></b
        ><span
          >The California Penal Code is to be interpreted in light of the common
          law it codified. Cases from common law rule that only a child who has
          been born can be murdered. The Penal Code further forbids the courts
          from convicting or punishing anyone for a crime not specified by
          statute. Statutes are to be interpreted in the manner most favorable
          to the defendant. Finally, no one can be convicted of an act they
          committed before that act was a crime, in other words, no one may be
          punished under <i>ex post facto</i> legislation.</span

        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The majority reasons that the defendant may only be indicted for
          murder if the fetus was a �human being� under the definition used in
          the </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          murder statute. The words �human being�
          <span class="GramE">were</span> chosen at the time the statute was
          written, which was in 1850. The court argues that in 1850, an infant
          could only be murdered if it had been born alive. Therefore, the words
          did not mean to include fetuses.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In response to the State�s argument that the common law requirement
          of live birth was outdated due to advances in medicine, the majority
          enumerated two obstacles to any change in the criminal law.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >First, the majority, explains, the constitutional separation of
          powers and the principle of legality prevent the court from creating
          new crimes.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          ><br />
          Second, even if the court expanded the statute to include the conduct
          of the defendant, the change would not apply retroactively because of
          the Constitutional guarantee of due process. The defendant would have
          to know in advance that such conduct is illegal. The court finds that
          the defendant could not have foreseen a change in the murder statute,
          and thus holding him to the change would violate his right of due
          process.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Acting Chief Justice Burke dissented, saying that the common law was
          a product of its time, and that the court�s interpretation of the
          murder statute�and in particular its working definition of �human
          being��should take into account changes in medicine that would allow a
          fetus at the stage of Baby Girl Vogt to live outside the womb.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Burke says that convicting the defendant of murder would not create a
          new offense, and thus would not violate the principle of legality or
          overstep the bounds of the court. Burke says that the legislature
          intends the words �human being� to be construed broadly and in such a
          way as to promote justice.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >He further argues against the majority�s contention that the
          defendant would lack �fair warning� and that the defendant�s right to
          due process would be violated. Burke claims that the defendant would
          know from common sense that he could be indicted for murder for
          killing a viable fetus.</span

            viable fetus�. The statute as written seems to include all and any

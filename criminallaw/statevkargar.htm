        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          <span class="SpellE">Kargar</span> kissed the genitals of his
          eighteen-month-old son, which is an acceptable practice in his
          culture. He was indicted for two counts of gross sexual assault. He
          moved to dismiss the case based on the
          <i>de <span class="SpellE">minimis</span></i> statute, which basically
          gives courts reasonable flexibility in administering criminal statutes
          in unusual cases. His motion was denied and he was convicted. He
          appealed on the basis that his motion should have been granted.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Should the trial court have dismissed the charges against
          <span class="SpellE">Kargar</span> based on a �cultural
          defense�?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          If the admittedly criminal conduct was not envisioned by the
          legislature when it defined the crime, it might not be punishable
          under the <i>de <span class="SpellE">minimis</span></i> statute.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court looks at the legislative history of the gross sexual assault
          statute and finds that it specifically excluded certain �innocent�
          contacts not done for sexual gratification or to cause harm. The court
          finds that if the legislature had been aware of the conduct in
          question in this case, it may have been excluded as an offense.</span

        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b

            >The problem is that some people might want to forbid conduct that
            is entirely innocent in other cultures that we think is wrong. For
            example, no matter how innocent �female circumcision� or
            foot-binding is in other cultures, we may have a strong interest in
            forbidding and punishing it here. Some people might find
            <span class="SpellE">Kargar�s</span> conduct so inherently
            disgusting that they would even support having it punished on a
            strict liability basis. If a majority of people in a certain
            jurisdiction felt that way, there would be a tricky question of
            constitutional rights or judicial activism set against the power of
            the legislature as the representatives of the people.</span

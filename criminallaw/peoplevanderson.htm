          The defendant killed the victim due to an alleged threat of serious
          bodily harm from another person. The defendant was convicted of
          first-degree murder. The defendant appealed on the basis that </span

        ><span>
          statute allowed the duress defense for any crime except offenses
          punishable by death, or, alternatively, that duress is a partial
          excuse that should reduce first-degree murder to a lesser
          offense.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> Is duress a defense to murder?</span>

        ><span> At common law, duress was not a defense to murder. Under </span

        ><span>
          statute, duress was not a defense to any crime punishable by death. At
          the time of that statute, all first-degree murder was punishable by
          death.</span

        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court reasons that the legislature did not intend the duress
          defense to change in applicability with every change in the
          application of capital punishment. The courtï¿½s major policy concern is
          with gang violence, which was not the context of this case at all. The
          court fears that in a gang structure, the underlings could murder with
          impunity by arguing that they were under duress from their superiors
          in the criminal enterprise.</span

        <span
          >At common law, if you act in justifiable self-defense, you�re not
          guilty of any crime. Even if you prove all the elements of the crime
          of murder, if you have a justification, then you�re not guilty. Even
          if you have the intent to kill that usually constitutes malice, you
          may not be guilty of the offense.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >What if you shoot someone in self-defense, but the gun wasn�t loaded
          and neither the defendant nor the victim knew that? Will the defendant
          still get acquitted of murder? Yes. We would say that the defendant
          had a <i>reasonable belief</i> that the victim was a deadly threat.
          Under the reasonable belief requirement, even though the person
          couldn�t have killed the defendant, the defendant still is acquitted
          even though what he did was objectively wrong.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >What if it turns out that the gun was a toy gun and it was obvious to
          pretty much any normal person that the gun wasn�t real? Then the
          defendant loses the self-defense claim because the belief wasn�t
          objectively reasonable.</span

        <span
          >In the first hypothetical, we have the same result at common law and
          under the Model Penal Code. In the second example, the result is the
          same. On the other hand, in the �toy gun� example, the Model Penal
          Code would find the defendant subject to the lesser charge of
          negligent homicide.</span

        <span
          >If an actor�s belief is sincere but reckless or negligent, the actor
          isn�t justified as far as reckless or negligent offenses. If the
          defendant was <i>negligent</i> in believing that a toy gun was
          actually real, then under the Model Penal Code the defendant wouldn�t
          be guilty of murder. The defendant would be guilty of negligent
          homicide if the defendant was negligent, and the defendant would be
          guilty of manslaughter if the defendant was reckless.</span

          five bullets. The victims asked him for five dollars. He immediately
          stood up and started shooting the victims one by one. He shot again at
          one of the victims.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What is the issue on appeal? Goetz wanted the charges dismissed
          because he said that the Grand Jury instructions were erroneous. The
          trial court and intermediate appellate court bought his argument. What
          was the alleged improper instruction? He felt that the prosecution
          gave an objective standard whereas the standard should have been
          subjective based on the statute. The intermediate appellate court
          argued that the emphasis in the phrase �he reasonably believes� is on
          �<i>he</i>�. That becomes a subjective standard because we�re not
          interested in what a reasonable person would do, but rather whether
          the defendant thought he was doing a reasonable thing.</span

        <span
          >Carter suggests two different explanations. There is both theory and
          practice: juries don�t always follow the law. The jury might have
          accepted the �rapid-fire� theory as either showing a lacking of
          voluntary act, an excuse, or a lack of mens rea. On the other hand,
          they might have just reacted to being mad about crime and thought that
          the victims got what they deserved. That would be a justification or
          moral forfeiture theory.</span

        <span

          They also called the victims �The Gang of Four�. The jury was given
          two different ways to imagine why they wanted to acquit. They might
          have also just nullified.</span

          justified, but rather excused. Dressler argues that this could create

        ><span
          >Does the accused have to go onto a public highway voluntarily to be
          convicted of being drunk on a public highway?</span

        <b><span>Rule: </span></b
        ><span
          >You cannot be convicted of being drunk on a public highway if you

        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The case is pretty clear-cut. Even though the particular statute cited
          doesn�t explicitly require a voluntary act, the court says that
          basically a voluntary act is part of the nature of <i>any</i> crime,
          and thus this particular conviction was in error.</span

          >The conviction was reversed and Martin was found not guilty.</span

            >We don�t punish people for their thoughts any longer, but should
            we? It�s argued that it�s impossible to really know what people are
            thinking. It is also suggested that we require an act as well as a
            thought because we want to make sure the person cannot be deterred
            and because we want to prevent multiple prosecutions. It�s suggested
            that we might want to arrest someone who freely confessed to
            intending to kill the President. If we did this, however, no one
            would confess their intention, and thus our opportunity to prevent
            the act would be taken away. If I was a
            <a href="retributivejustifications.html">retributivist</a>, I might
            be skeptical about whether mere thoughts earn society�s
            condemnation, and thus whether such thoughts are punishable. If I
            were, more specifically, an advocate of victim vindication, I might
            be of two minds on the matter: on one hand, I would figure that
            since no act had transpired, no �false moral statement� had been
            made that was in need of correction. On the other hand, I might
            believe that given the chance, we ought to correct false moral
            thoughts in a person�s mind before they are expressed in
            action.</span

of the case are the same except it takes place between two men rather than a
man and a woman? If a man behaved the
same way as the victim in this case, would the court have ruled differently,
notwithstanding possible (maybe likely) prejudice based on sexual orientation? If <span class=SpellE>Estrich’s</span> logic
holds, a man in such a situation <i>would</i> be expected to resist rape by
force while a woman would not.</span></p>

dir=LTR><span>It seems like
some of these elements are inherent in some of the others. I imagine the type of force contemplated was
heavy physical force of holding the other person down or beating them into
submission rather than the type of force used in this case. I think a skilled prosecutor could argue that
the cited statute includes the threat of economic harm as a possible element,
but there may be case law that says otherwise. I have to wonder, though, if society wants to make forced sex by threat
of economic harm exactly the same grade of offense as forced sex by threat of
physical harm. They’re both serious, but
I think there is a different in seriousness.</span></span></p>

dir=LTR><span>The resistance
requirement seems to come from case law in </span></span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> rather than from the statute. The court seems to interpret the first
element of the offense in a quasi-Newtonian way, that is, “there is no force unless
there is resistance”. I think there
shouldn’t be a resistance requirement in the offense, but I certainly think
resistance can have a strong evidentiary function when it occurs. It should not be a <i>necessary</i> condition
to prove rape, though.<br>
<br>
The Code approach is better than the “traditional” approach, but probably still
lacking.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

consent to robbery. But some rapes,
arguably, would be perfectly legal sex but for the internal mental state of the
victim. Therefore, there is a higher
risk of false reporting than the other crimes listed. I think this is a reason to treat rape
differently, although we may want to abandon it as a matter of policy.</span></span></p>

would point to (1) the difference in size—and presumably strength—between the defendant
and victim, (2) the fact that the defendant said “I don’t want to hurt you”, (3)
the defendant touched the victim’s shoulder, and (4) the defendant carried the victim
to the wooded area.<br>

The defense would counter by saying that (1) the difference in size didn’t come
into play because there wasn’t a physical fight involved, (2) the phrase “I don’t
want to hurt you” is ambiguous, and (3) the victim was on her bicycle and could
have tried to escape on it.</span></span></p>

sounds suspiciously like "preponderance of the evidence" rather than "beyond a

seems as though it may be in line with the court's logic overall. If conviction cannot be sustained on
circumstantial evidence alone unless there is no reasonable hypothesis of
innocence, then if you show the only possible hypothesis is not reasonable, you
<i>can </i>sustain a conviction. But I
think there may be a subtle logical fallacy here: the rule doesn't say that you
<i>must</i> convict if there's no reasonable hypothesis of innocence. It only says that you <i>must not</i> sustain
a conviction based on circumstantial evidence where there<i> is</i> a
reasonable hypothesis of innocence. The
court could have still overturned this verdict on the grounds that the <i>hypothesis
consistent with guilt</i> was not proven at trial <i>beyond a reasonable doubt</i>.</span></span></p>

      <p><span>Should people be punished for omissions?</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Keep in mind the difference between statutory omissions and the more
          typical case, that is, commission by omission. That�s what we have in
          <i>Beardsley</i>. Beardsley is being prosecuted for a
          <i>regular old crime</i> that you can usually only commit by an
          <i>act</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Isn�t there a slippery slope problem with punishing omission? Is this
          problem evident in the <i>Beardsley </i>case?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Another problem with omission cases is the interpretation of what is
          going on.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Beardsley tried to take away Ms. Burns�s morphine. That would seem to
          show that he knew it was dangerous.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about personal responsibility? What if you�re too drunk to make
          a rational choice? How about the distinction between a legal duty and
          a moral duty?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say we want to find Beardsley guilty, but we don�t want to change the
          law. There are five categories of circumstances listed in
          <i>Jones</i>. Which one could we use to �git� Beardsley?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We have the parent-child relationship and the husband-wife
          relationship. We are also told that if you voluntarily assume the care
          of another, you may have a legal duty to them. What about his action
          of knocking the pills out of her hand? What about having someone else
          move her to the basement? Well, he didn�t prevent <i>others</i> for
          rendering aid.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But�arguably, by moving her into the basement, she might have been
          better off if he had kicked her out of the house.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>In some sense, we might argue,
          he secluded her in a place where nobody else is likely to find her in
          an appropriate length of time. That�s probably the strongest argument
          for the prosecutor in this case.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say you have no legal duty to act, but you start to act. If you then
          quit, you will have a duty if by having started then quitting you put
          the person in a <i>worse</i> position than if you had done nothing at
          all.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say you see someone drowning in the ocean and you go out and swim to
          try to save them. Say you turn around and go home. You�re not
          responsible. You haven�t made that person�s condition any worse. On
          the other hand, let�s say you start swimming out and you told someone
          else not to bother because you�ll take care of it. Now, you�ve
          secluded the person in need, and if you omit, you may be found to be
          responsible.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Recall that in the Beardsley case, we are only questioning the first
          element of a crime: an omission.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>If we found a breach of a
          legal duty, then we would have to look at <i>mens rea</i>, which can

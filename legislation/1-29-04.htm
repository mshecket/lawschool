          money comes from donors.
          <span class="GramE">Individual people.</span> Maybe a corporate
          culture where midlevel managers must give to PAC or no promotion, but
          it�s still individual corporate actors. There will be disclosure to
          public about who donated and how much. When a corporation ends up

        <span
          >What�s the importance to the majority of the enactment of � 501
          (<span class="SpellE">i</span>)? Has Congress acquiesced in the
          anti-discriminatory position taken by the IRS in 1970? The best
          evidence in legislative history terms from the majority�s point of
          view is that both the House and Senate reports accompanying the � 501
          (<span class="SpellE">i</span>) provision cite
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >Green v. <span class="SpellE">Connally</span> </i
          >with approval. That case established that discrimination on account
          of race is inconsistent with an educational institution�s tax-exempt
          status.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why didn�t the Congress act to actually change the statute? Who is in
          favor of the majority? Did Congress acquiesce? Should that
          acquiescence be given force by the Court? Congress had this high on
          its radar screen for 12 years, but didn�t act. Is this an example of
          �positive inaction�?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Two different kinds of inaction have different amounts of value? Why
          might you value one more than another? How do we differentiate? There
          are thousands of bills introduced into the legislative process. Things
          happen, things don�t happen, but the Court puts a lot of weight on
          this <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">particular</i> instance of
          inaction. How come? What are we assuming is true for a failure to
          change a ruling that�s been reviewed in committee or hearings 12 times
          in 15 years as opposed to a failure to change a ruling that has no
          committee hearing or anything else? We assume that the leaders who are
          involved in processing legislation
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">know about it</i>. If it�s come
          through committees, then the leaders know it�s going on. Legislative
          inaction is a stable part of the process. More stuff
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">doesn�t happen</i> than stuff
          that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">does happen</i>. People
          introduce bills upsetting the status quo all the time! If these bills
          don�t get taken up by a committee, you can�t assume that this is an
          endorsement of the status quo.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The ruling is correct on its merits: the tax-exempt status mustn�t
          operate against public policy. But what is public policy in this area?
          Does public policy eliminate all discrimination in education? Does the
          Constitution prohibit racial discrimination in private education? Who
          is being regulated under the Constitution? It�s the government! No
          government can deny equal protection or due process of law. Private
          individuals are not regulated by the Fourteenth Amendment! You could
          decide that any time there are tax benefits or burdens, there is state
          action. Then you could possibly have a constitutional challenge to
          every form of tax benefit or burden that exists! In the context of
          education alone, we know that the government doesn�t regulate private
          institutions the way that they regulate public institutions.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So then we have these federal statutes. We have the Civil Rights Act,
          the Voting Rights Act, plus some executive orders. Does the Court
          suggest that any of these laws prohibit or restrict racial
          discrimination by private schools? We�re not talking about
          <span class="GramE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">policy</i>,</span
          >
          we�re talking about
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">positive law</i>. The
          Constitution doesn�t protect minorities or women from being
          discriminated against in private educational institutions. None of the
          statutes mentioned prohibits racial discrimination in private
          education.</span
        >

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What else is in the 1964 Civil Rights Act besides Title IV and VI?
          What else have we studied? I <span class="SpellE">dunno</span>. We�ve
          studied Title VII, which deals with employment. Who does that Title
          affect? This Title talks about private employees. This is the biggest
          civil rights statute of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Congress doesn�t
          include private actors in some of the Titles. The Congress insists on
          a government axis in education that it did not insist on for
          employment. You can argue that Congress
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">knows</i> how to ban private
          discrimination by private entities but
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">chose not to do so</i>. The
          public policy we�re trying to build does not �<span class="GramE"
            >jump off</span
          >
          the page� of the Civil Rights Act.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Supreme Court is writing for the history books and not just for
          the case books and the reporter. The Court insists on resolving this
          in the broadest terms and not just in narrow legal terms. There could
          have been arguments crafted differently, but the Court isn�t doing it.
          You might criticize it on legislative inaction terms.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the difference between
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Moragne</i></span
          >
          and this situation? The previous situation was a common law situation,
          but this is a statutory situation. We have a canon that the Court
          could have used, which is the canon to avoid constitutional problems.
          How could you build an argument for the majority based on that canon?
          If you�re going to avoid the constitutional problem, you would try to
          construe tax-exempt status as equivalent to a federal grant. In order
          to avoid that, we will simply decide that when the government grants
          tax-exempt status, it can�t do it for anything that the government
          itself couldn�t have engaged in. Would that be fair? When the Court is
          <span class="SpellE">recrafting</span> a statute, it�s doing it
          because it�s trying to avoid a constitutional issue. The courts have
          choices in situations like this and could have gone a more �lawyerly�
          way. But in this case, they are writing on a much more expansive
          �palette�.</span

        <b><span>The �subterfuge� case study</span></b
        ><span></span>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The ADEA is first enacted in 1967. It is first interpreted in 1977 by
          the Supreme Court in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">McMahon</i>. Congress,
          displeased with the decision, amends the statute. Then there�s another
          Supreme Court case and another amendment. There�s a big debate over
          the word �subterfuge�! Subterfuge is not allowed. But what is it? The
          Court says that something that was done before the statute was enacted
          can�t be considered a subterfuge to avoid a statute that didn�t yet
          exist.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >You can�t discriminate on the basis of age. Is there language in the
          text that suggests the Congress was focused on the hiring issue rather
          than the issue of preventing termination? They want �jobs, jobs, jobs�
          for old people! What about the legislative history? How does that
          reinforce this view? Senator <span class="SpellE">Javits</span> says
          that he wants to increase hiring of older people. We need to find
          specific reference points. He says something about �a national policy�
          about hiring old people. We want a magic bullet phrase? </span

          >! There is a statement from the committee report that says that the
          key point of the bill is hiring! If we�re trying to promote hiring,
          how do we feel about retiring? What
          <span class="SpellE">Javits</span> is saying is that we need a broad
          exemption because we don�t want to interfere with hiring. He says that
          we want to get people in the workforce, even at some cost in terms of
          benefits.</span

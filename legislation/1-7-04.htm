        <span
          >This is a �general skills� course. There isn�t a tight package of
          discrete doctrine like you�ll find in Torts or Con Law, for example.
          There�s no natural starting or ending point. There�s also no right or
          wrong answer. There are lots of ways to interpret statutes. It�s a
          messy class, but it�s important.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >It�s important because we live in a �public law era�. The law that
          most affects people�s everyday
          <span class="GramE">lives is</span> largely statutory and regulatory.
          Therefore, a lot of what attorneys do involves applying, interpreting,
          understanding, and litigating about these statutes. Most law schools
          work with the case method, but it�s also important to understand the
          methodology of statutes and statutory interpretation.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >How about some reasons not to rely on the legislative history? In
          floor debates and such, people might be acting strategically and not
          genuinely. Also, in the House, you can make revisions to what you say
          on the floor. Therefore, you�re not always sure that something that�s
          printed in the Congressional Record is what was actually said on the
          floor. Committee reports, on the other hand, don�t have that problem.
          They are what they say they are. Legislative history is also very
          lengthy.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say we don�t have an absolutely clear text in a statute. If we don�t
          look at legislative history, what are we going to look at? Could we
          look at <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">history</i>
          <span class="SpellE">history</span>, like newspapers and stuff?
          Wouldn�t some of that be in the legislative history?</span

          parties have �dictionary wars�!</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How about some arguments for looking at legislative history? We could
          use it to find the intent behind a statute. What do we mean by intent?
          It�s what the legislature wanted the statute to mean.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What are some problems with this? Well, what is enacted? What does
          the process yield? It yields a law that people vote on. There�s a big
          debate here! Some people say that legislative history can�t have any
          meaning because we don�t know whether a speaker is speaking for
          herself, for a majority, for a critical
          <span class="SpellE">submajority</span>, or being strategic. Others
          argue strongly that there is an adequate way of understanding
          legislative history. Once we assign relative importance to different
          parts of the legislative history, it does turn out to be helpful in
          informing us what ambiguous language means.</span

          has traditionally dealt with stuff related to the courts and

          through the courts, we should send it to the Judiciary. On the other
          hand, there are other sections that could go to other committees. This
          is a highly charged political argument! The Judiciary Committee was

        <b><span>Administrative law and statutory interpretation</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Courts traditionally have tried to protect their common law powers
          from encroachments from legislatures. And then courts may be more
          suspicious of agency rules because they lack the same democratic
          lineage that legislatures have. Agency rules are not issued directly
          by elected officials and don�t always involve the kinds of public
          participation that we see in the legislative process that tends to
          legitimate action by government. Should agencies or courts have
          greater authority in interpreting statutes? That�s the big question in
          the modern age of administrative laws. Some statutes are enforced
          directly by the courts. Some statutes establish administrative
          agencies to make rules and then enforce them.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The basic or traditional approach of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Udall v. Tallman</i> is that
          courts give a lot of deference to the agency that is charged with the
          enforcement of a statute that is being interpreted. We give
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">special</i> deference when
          statutes are �untried and new� and there is a contemporaneous
          construction issue. Why? Is that more a matter of expertise in
          legislative intent or expertise in subject matter? Let us focus on the
          intent issue, which seems particularly salient when we are within
          �hailing distance� of what Congress is thinking. A key assumption in
          the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">BankAmerica</i> case is
          that contemporaneous rules are more authoritative because they are
          issued closer to the time of enactment. Is there any special problem
          with giving deference to the agency based on the agency�s perception
          of what statutory intent is? Why should we assume that agencies are
          completely neutral? The agencies may be
          <span class="GramE">partisan</span>! They may be subject to outside
          lobbying. Maybe the administration didn�t even support the bill.
          Sometimes the agency may have opposed the bill, and thus it�s in their
          interest to interpret it in a watered-down way.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >About whose legislative intent is the agency a likely expert? They
          are probably most aware of what the committee is thinking. They
          probably didn�t spend much time dealing with the rest of the House and
          Senate. Depending on how much you want to credit committee reports,
          you may be okay with this. But if you are like Scalia, for example,
          and see the committee process as being prone to manipulation, you
          might be concerned about agency communication when it�s based on
          communication with committee staff. This is what public choice
          theorists call the �<a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_triangle"
            >iron triangle</a
          >�: committee staffs, agencies, and interest groups who can create a
          particularly favorable statutory interpretation and then defend it
          over time.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If contemporaneousness is a proxy for legislative intent, is there an
          aspect of the agency�s regulatory approach that should enhance or
          improve our view that they really are competent? What makes us
          comfortable with their competence? They have a process! They give
          notice and they ask for comments from the public. It�s not as
          politically accountable as the legislative process, but it does have a
          sort of democratic pedigree to it. You won�t get a rule adopted just
          by announcing it. You issue a preliminary rule, you invite interested
          groups to comment, and all of this generates a public record that
          courts can review.</span

        <span
          >Insofar as they have stood the political test of time, there is an
          implication that Congress has acquiesced in the rule. If there was
          something particularly troubling about a rule, they could have used
          their power to revisit it. Also, the public begins to rely on a
          long-standing rule. If the court abrogates the rule, they could upset
          the reasonable expectations of many people.</span

        <span
          >Rehnquist is writing this opinion. Why don�t we defer to the EEOC
          guidelines of 1972? When Congress says: �We charge you as an agency to
          promulgate rules to further the purposes of this Act�, the agency must
          go ahead and do that. The EEOC didn�t have that authority under Title
          VII when this case was decided. The EEOC was supposed to do many
          things, but their authority to issue guidelines and interpretations
          was more limited because they weren�t given formal rulemaking power.
          The standard is dependent on how consistent you�ve been. We want to
          know if the agency is consistent in its pronouncements. Why does the
          agency fail here, according to Rehnquist? We have had a series of
          divergent interpretations about whether pregnancy is covered in this
          situation. The EEOC changed its mind over a period of time. Is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Skidmore</i> the �kiss of
          death� in terms of getting your guideline sustained?</span

      <p>
        <span
          >This is the major and still controlling Supreme Court statement of
          the role of agencies in statutory interpretation. This one concerns
          the EPA�s interpretation of the Clean Air Act. What is the two-step
          test that the Court sets forth for when a court should defer to an
          agency�s construction? If Congress has spoken directly to the issue,
          we override the agency and there is no deference. But if Congress has
          not spoken directly, and the statute is silent or ambiguous with
          respect to the particular issue, then the court must ask �whether the
          agency�s answer is based on a permissible construction of the
          statute.� That sounds like a pretty low level of scrutiny. Regulations
          are given controlling weight unless the construction is impermissible.
          If the construction is �arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary
          to the statute�, then the court can override the construction.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >For this form of deference, is the Court relying on traditional
          justifications for trusting agencies? No. This reverses the
          traditional notion. By default, the courts
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">will</i> defer to agencies. In
          circumstances where the legislation is not clear on its face, agencies
          have more legitimacy than courts in being the primary interpreters.
          That�s a big step, and a sea change in the way courts look at agency
          actions. Agencies have been allowed to have a special perch because
          they are either experts on legislative intent or have special
          expertise, but now the courts find that agencies have an even more
          privileged positions than the courts do!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court recognizes three reasons why a statute might be ambiguous:
          (1) Congress may intend to have the agency strike the balance. (2)
          Congress may have ignored the issue entirely. (3) Congress may have
          failed to strike a balance and thus agreed to leave it blank. But it
          doesn�t matter for judicial purposes which of these things
          occurred.</span

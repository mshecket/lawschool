          This is kind a good review mechanism. The case arises under the
          Endangered Species Act which forbids anyone from �taking� an
          endangered species. There are many definitions of the word �take�. A
          regulation interprets �harm� pretty broadly. The appellate court held
          that the regulation exceeded the agency�s authority, but the Supreme
          Court reverses.</span

          How does he do that? This is a variation on the surplusage canon or
          the Whole Act Rule. If all harm does is to reiterate what the other
          words mean, then why would they have put it in? It must go beyond the
          other verbs and say something different than the other ones say. What
          does Scalia have to say about the other verbs? He says that they are
          all affirmative, intentional acts rather than omissions or negligent
          behavior. But what about �harass�? That could happen indirectly. Some
          of these verbs may be broader than simply intentional. What about
          �wound� or �kill�? Can�t you do that unintentionally? Is this a list
          that is sufficiently consistent such that we should �fold�
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">harm</i> into the other ones,
          or does each verb actually add something to the mix? If Prof.
          Llewellyn was looking down on this debate, he would be pleased. He
          would argue that this shows that the canons are totally bogus!</span

          textual justification? He has a series of arguments that support, in
          his view, the conclusion. Recognize that this is a debate about
          whether the statute is so clear that the agency has
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">no discretion</i> to implement
          its own interpretation of the statute. Scalia�s position is that this
          is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">so clear</i> that the agency
          has no discretion and they got it wrong. Stevens�s starting point is
          that it�s so clear that the agency is acting according to the intent
          of Congress that they�ve got it right. Each justice thinks the statute
          is clear; they just think it�s clear
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in opposite directions</i

        <span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Chevron </i>move: Stevens says
          the statute is clear, so they win on stage one. But you can argue that
          the statute is actually ambiguous. Congress wasn�t manifestly clear.
          We should go on to stage two! And at that stage, the agency has a lot
          of discretion. And what about the intent and purpose from legislative
          history?</span

          usual view on this subject?</span

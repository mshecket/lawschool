        <b><span>The House Judiciary Committee version</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >At the end of class yesterday we had just turned to result of the
          Judiciary Committee�s deliberations. Who is covered under this bill?
          Which employers are covered? The House Judiciary Committee version of
          Title VII establishes the EEOC. How does it define �employer�? It
          defines employer as a business that employs more than 25
          employees.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The original Republican bill prohibited discrimination on the part of
          any business that got federal money or contracts. Is this the same
          group of employers? This version affects the entire private employment
          universe as long as you have more than 25 employees.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>This is a pretty big expansion
          of who will be protected by the non-discrimination provisions of
          federal law.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the mechanisms for enforcement? How does this differ from
          the Administration�s bill or the House Republican version? The
          Administration�s bill was fluff. The House Republican bill allowed the
          cancellation of federal contracts. Under
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">this </i>bill, the Commission
          has the authority to bring suit in federal court. The old Commission
          could only make administrative investigations. Sometimes agencies have
          the exclusive right to enforce statutes in court, sometimes
          individuals have that exclusive right, and sometimes an agency gets
          the first �crack� but then individuals have a shot to go forward.
          These are big expansions.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The point is that the House committee has built a considerably
          stronger bill. Why did this happen? Why would the House Democrats
          report a bill out of committee that goes further than either the
          Administration or the House Republicans wanted? The Democrats want to
          make it as strong as possible so that if it gets watered down it will
          still be worth something.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Who cared about this bill in the 60s? There are important partisan
          things going on here. We have an emerging group of voters in big
          cities: African-American voters. Who will they regard as the champions
          of their interests? Can Republicans get African-American votes? They
          weren�t saddled with a group of Southern legislators committed to
          suppressing civil rights. On the other hand, Northern Democrats and
          Western Democrats didn�t want to become a minority in their own
          region.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >There�s also a moral aspect to this: somebody has to take on the
          Southern wing of the Democratic Party. It�s been the dominant wing of
          the party on civil rights since Reconstruction. It�s up to liberal
          Democrats to force their party to take a morally defensible stance on
          the biggest social issue in the </span

          to address this matter? This can be a long section. It wasn�t long in
          this case, since civil rights demonstrations were at TV every night.

          time raising money and doing other junk, so they need to know what�s
          going on back in Congress. If you�re in the Judiciary Committee, you
          don�t have time to keep up with the Commerce Committee, for example.

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The bill started in the House rather than the Senate. There were lots
          of obstacles in the Senate. Southern Democrats were stronger there.
          What makes it easier for a determined minority to cut or thwart
          legislation? The House has a Rules Committee that�s charged with
          setting up the terms of the debate on the House floor. For any bill
          that�s being reported out of a substantive committee, the Rules
          Committee comes up with guidelines on how that bill will be debated.
          For example, they might limit the number of amendments, how much time
          is spent on each amendment, or how much time is spent total. The Rules
          Committee is an important and powerful �traffic cop� for debates in
          the House.</span

        <span

          you want unless there is unanimous consent to keep amendments from
          coming up. A single senator can prevent unanimous consent. Each

      <p>
        <span

          done because it�s hard for 435 people to do business as 435
          independent sources of power. Some say the same is true for 100
          people, but these rules are old and reflect when there were fewer

          that it would be better to start in the Senate instead of the House?
          Maybe if you�re worried about losing 20-30% of what your best bill
          would be, maybe instead of losing 5-10% in the House and 5-10% in the
          Senate, you try to get your best in the Senate first.</span

          contribution, a lawmaker voted way differently than they ever had

          >Most people think that explicit quid pro quo arrangements are very
          rare because people aren�t that stupid. So what are you seeking in
          exchange for your campaign contribution if it�s not quid pro quo
          specific delivery of a vote? You�re paying for access! You don�t know
          what your next agenda item is going to be, but you want access to the
          real dude or dudette!</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Think about corrupt intent as a sum result of a bunch of factors.
          Something is more likely to be corrupt if you�re appealing to an
          official�s self-interest as opposed to an official�s self-interest
          only incidentally to your own pursuit.</span

          just floor debate, but it�s still limited in some ways. It is said
          that the Speech or Debate Clause limits the possibility for
          prosecution.</span

          perception that the executive branch might harass the legislative
          branch, private individuals might also harass legislators for
          defamatory acts. Does anybody have to go to court to defend
          themselves?</span

          extremely effective speaker in Reagan�s second term. There was a lot
          of bitterness when Newt Gingrich started this ethics investigation.
          Both the House and Senate provide for these kinds of ethics
          investigations. Gingrich became the first sitting speaker to be
          reprimanded by the House for something else. What function do these
          kinds of procedures fulfill?</span

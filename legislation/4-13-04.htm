          statements about an Alaska-only interpretation of the statute by
          Udall. Also, the exchange of letters with the Justice Department was
          wholly private. Maybe we can say the same thing about Melcher.</span

        <span
          >This is unusual! The traditional view laid out by the notes says that
          the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for finding
          out the views of an earlier Congress. The two Congresses may have
          different members. Why should we reject the traditional view here? Did
          the legislature rely on a certain interpretation in making further
          legislation? It�s unusual, which is why it�s in the casebook, but it�s
          also a case where members are paying serious attention to the way
          their conferees are acting.</span

          >It�s a highly uncontroversial case! Do private schools that enforce
          racial discrimination under religious doctrine qualify as tax-exempt
          institutions under � 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code? Well, gee
          whiz, I think�NO. Until 1970, the IRS had granted tax-exempt status
          without regard to racial discrimination. But then the IRS changes
          their policy. On the face of the language of � 503(c), which side of
          the debate is favored? Rehnquist seems to have a good argument in
          dissent. Where does the legislative history point here? The
          legislative history shows that Congress had been adding on more and
          more exemptions. There�s nothing to show that Congress is taking on
          common law �baggage� that says we won�t go against public
          policy.</span

        <span
          >What has Congress done since 1970? Burger is looking at this in the
          early 1980s. We have 10 years of Congress�s response to the IRS
          ruling. What if the IRS had said that they would give special tax
          advantages to racial minorities to make up for past discrimination?
          Would that reflect our �national understanding�? The IRS has some
          rule-making power, but it probably isn�t that broad. What is
          Congress�s reaction to the revenue ruling? If the IRS is a
          spokesperson for public policy, they were also the spokesperson for
          the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">wrong</i> public policy for
          a long time. Is Congress�s inaction a useful guide? We have 13
          different bills over a 12 year period where Congress had the
          opportunity, and debated the possibility, of amending � 501 to
          contradict the IRS. But they didn�t do it. However, they
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">did</i> amend � 501 to do other
          things. The Court says that we have intense awareness by Congress of
          what the IRS did plus inaction, which leads to the conclusion that
          they accepted the ruling.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Did the legislative branch endorse the IRS�s change in position in
          1970? There is at least an argument that they did. There was inaction
          in the face of constant attempts to revise � 501. This is �positive
          inaction� of the form we saw in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Flood</i>
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">v. Kuhn</i>.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Tomorrow, we�ll think more about what � 501 (i) really means here.
          What is Rehnquist�s comeback? What if Congress tried to pass � 501 (i)
          but failed? Then we�ll deal with the harder question of what the
          public policy is that we�re trying to wrap ourselves around. Is there
          a policy against racial discrimination in private educational
          facilities?</span

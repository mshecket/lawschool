          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">plain meaning analysis</i>,

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">legislative purpose</i>. Unlike
          the text provides a definitive answer, the court should interpret the
          statute in such a way as to further its purpose. This is sort of the
          �mischief� rule. If the common law didn�t work to cure some evil and
          thus a statute was put into effect, the court should interpret the
          statute to continue to fight that evil.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This is more than imaginative reconstruction. Hart and Sacks assumed
          that the legislature was made up of reasonable persons, and so the
          court should go beyond the cynical and short term positions of
          reasonable actors, but instead weave the statute into the overall
          fabric of the law.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >From an empirical point of view, are there any problems with this
          description of the legislative process? Do we have any reason to think
          that legislators are or are not the way Hart and Sacks describe them
          as being? How do legislators function as legislators? Hart and Sacks
          believed that the collective product of the legislature was
          rational.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are problems with this motivational analysis. Sometimes people
          pursue public policy, but sometimes they pursue party discipline,
          donations, or some other kind of strategic behavior. The descriptive
          accuracy of the Hart and Sacks approach has thus been
          questioned.</span

        ><span>
          courts be engaged in the activity of assuming or ascribing a purpose
          to what legislatures do? Something must go on beyond textual analysis
          a lot of the time. What�s the risk in letting the courts ascribe a
          purpose to the legislature? The court might impose
          <span class="GramE">their own</span> values on unclear text.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Hart and Sacks seem consistent with norms that try to get to
          predictability in statutory interpretation. We generally want a set of
          rules that will apply the same way to every case.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How about the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">best answer</i> theory? This is
          expounded principally by Professor
          <span class="SpellE">Dworkin</span> and by Eskridge (though not
          <span class="SpellE">Frickey</span>). The court is thought to act in a
          �common law� fashion in order to make the statute �the best it can
          possibly be�. If the metaphor for imaginative reconstruction is
          �archeological exploration�, one metaphor for best answer is �the
          chain novel�. The court writes the next chapter, and it acknowledges
          that it is responsible for taking over and asserting its supremacy.
          Judges may tend to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">use</i> this
          approach more than they will
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">admit </i>they use it.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If each particular judge gets to choose the best answer, we may
          abandon any pretense of predictability.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So how do we put this together? These five approaches may be seen as
          mutually exclusive. For example, if plain meaning works, maybe we
          could just use that. On the other hand, most judges see these
          techniques as cumulative, where you start at the �bottom� and then
          work your way �up� the funnel. The funnel is supposed to suggest an
          order of priority. If the words of a statute are clear, it will
          probably govern your interpretation, with some exceptions. There is a
          strong presumption that the plain meaning, when it is clear, will win
          out.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Similarly, if you look at the words alone versus intent, the words
          win out. If you have clear intent versus imaginative reconstruction,
          the clear intent wins out, and so on. Regrettably, none of these
          elements ever comes to you in pure, clear, and unambiguous form. So as
          an attorney you have to sift through.</span

          mentioned? How do people come over to this country when they are in a
          troupe of artists? <span class="GramE">It�s</span> high profile and
          high visibility. We want those people to get into this country because
          they�re entertaining us. Maybe it never occurred to anyone to consider
          individual pastors coming over to preach at an individual church. The
          statute dealt not just with manual labor, but with contracts for
          manual labor. Congress was concerned that people were being brought
          over as what amounted to �owned labor�. Restrictions were never
          imposed on so-called �immigration by worthy foreigners�. But then why
          not amend the statute to make that clear? It might be very difficult
          to draft something that�s consistent with that concept.</span

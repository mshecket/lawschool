      <p>
        <span
          >The model we had on the board yesterday, the �ABC� model, was meant
          to illustrate how one group of public choice theorists are critical of
          the deliberative process. They believe it is incoherent. Another group
          posits that the process isn�t irrational, but instead is part of a
          quite rational political market where votes are bought with money.
          That�s a more cynical model about how legislation is bought and sold.
          It�s based on the idea of the free rider. People have the incentive to
          sit back and hope someone else will carry the burden of pushing
          through large, complex legislation.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This leads to the table at the top of p. 59. There are four types of
          legislation depending on the concentration and distribution of costs
          and benefits. When the costs are more concentrated, the opposition
          will be concentrated. When the benefits are concentrated, the support
          will be concentrated.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Take for example farm subsides: a small number of agribusinesses are
          paid a lot of money to produce agricultural goods at an artificially
          high price. Thus a small number of people care passionately while the
          large majority of people only see a small cost that they might not
          even notice.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If support and opposition are both concentrated, you�ll likely get
          gridlock.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The assumptions and reasoning behind this model are that legislators
          primarily care about reelection, that interest groups are the primary
          sources of information for legislators, and that interest groups
          participate in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">rent-seeking</i> behavior
          (seeking benefit at the cost of others).</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Are public <span class="GramE">choice</span> theories complete? Do
          they make sense? Do politicians care about anything else besides
          getting reelected? We might
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">hope</i> that they care about
          things other than getting reelected.</span

          and is so popular that there�s no chance he�ll get booted out of
          office? People who enter the legislature, whether they consider
          themselves career legislators or not, status and prestige are
          important among your peers, just like in any other job. Why else would
          McCullough do what he�s doing? Maybe he really thinks it�s the right
          thing to do. Some legislators may have self-selected because they are
          people who have a strong interest in public policy.</span

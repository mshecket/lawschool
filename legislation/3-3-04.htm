          >What is the relevance of the political realities of the time to the
          Court of Appeals of </span

          ><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          legislature had blocked passage of bills prohibiting discrimination
          against lesbian and gay parents. Could there be some problems with the
          way the court interpreted the statute given the policy expressed by
          the legislature? Is the court usurping the policy-making role
          here?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Can you justify the majority opinion as an effort to engage in
          purposive interpretation? What is Judge Kaye trying to do? Is the
          judge trying to protect the best interests of the child? Those are the
          basic purposes of any adoption law. You don�t have to appeal to a
          particular subsection of a statute to make this argument. Kaye may be
          saying that there is a pretty patchy statutory scheme that is not in
          harmony, but clearly has one purpose: to do good for kids. Kaye wants
          to harmonize the �slivers� of law and construe the statute to avoid
          discriminatory results. This opinion may be rehabilitated in purposive
          terms. We may not like having the court rewrite the text based on its
          values.</span

      <p>
        <span>When you look at the legislative background in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >, it�s hard to argue that Kaye didn�t know what was going on. But
          Kaye looks at �best interests of the child� as an anchor to try to
          harmonize conflicting provisions.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This is an old statute like 42 U.S.C. � 1983, which we�ll look at in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Smith v. Wade</i>. Because the
          statute is old, we want to ask whether the statute means something
          different today than when it was written. Shall the California Supreme
          Court invalidate contributory negligence and replace it with
          comparative negligence? In </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >, contributory negligence is actually part of state statues. So can
          the court really do this? Does the legislature have to abolish
          contributory negligence and replace it with comparative negligence? If
          they meant to do that, would they or wouldn�t they have done it
          already?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Moragne</i>, Harlan updated
          the common law of admiralty. But in this case, the court is trying to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">update a statute</i>. The court
          is not free to decide that �this is not a good policy, so let�s just
          change it�. Why can they do it in this case?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The language is: �Everyone is responsible, not only for the result of
          his willful acts, but also for an injury occasioned to another by his
          want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his property or
          person,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >except so far as the latter has, willfully or by want of ordinary
            care, brought the injury upon himself</i
          >.�</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The 1872 California Civil Code was never changed up to the date of
          the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Li</i> decision. What if
          the language in the Code was reenacted as the �Tort Reform Act of
          2003�? Is there anything in the language that invites you to conclude
          that it�s not contributory negligence? Part of it would be the fact
          that the title includes the word �reform�. Also, there is language in
          the statute that sounds �proportional�, which in turn sounds like the
          �more or less� rule of comparative negligence.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court here starts from the proposition that in 1872 people
          thought they were enacting contributory negligence. But if we started
          with the plain meaning of this language, you could read it as
          comparative negligence if you wanted to!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Ultimately, the court relies neither on the text nor the legislative
          history. They rely on �emerging concepts� in tort law from other
          jurisdictions. They conclude that the legislature in the past didn�t
          want to keep the judicial system from evolving.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What theory of interpretation is being used here? It�s more of a
          purposive or best answer approach. It�s quite liberal. They make a
          broad claim about legislative purpose. It�s more legitimate to couch
          the decision in legislative purpose terms rather than best answer
          terms. The former is more respectful to the power of the
          legislature.</span

      <br />

          foresight?</span

      <p>
        <span

          it was that complicated.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Shine and Shine separate in 1972. They divide their property without
          making a support agreement. Later, the plaintiff sues the defendant
          seeking separate maintenance. The court orders the defendant to pay
          $250/month in 1973. This is the key monetary resolution between them.
          This is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >maintenance order arising out of a separation</i
          >. Later, there is a divorce decree with no support. Later, in 1982,
          the plaintiff sues for arrears on the support payments. But the
          defendant was bankrupt, and, as we�ll see, the statute was all screwed
          up in 1982!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The plaintiff brings a lawsuit for declaratory judgment that the
          support payments are
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">nondischargeable</i> (that is,
          the payments still must be paid despite the bankruptcy). There is no
          separation agreement. That�s what the statute seems to require. How do
          we get around that apparent plain meaning problem?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court refers to two conflicting public policies in this area:
          first, bankruptcy rules are to be construed in favor of the debtor in
          order to help the debtor get back on his feet. But on the other hand,
          we generally won�t let bankrupt people off the hook from alimony and
          child support. That�s not exactly a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">bankruptcy law</i> policy. Why
          do we care about those particular debts as opposed to commercial
          debts? These debts are �inherent obligations�. Society is organized in
          the family unit. We have bankruptcy law, and we have
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">family law</i>. These two
          bodies of law are at odds in this case! We want to protect families
          and kids!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How was this statutory provision originally understood? What�s the
          common law background that informs how we understand marital payments?
          Alimony was considered a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">duty</i> rather than a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">debt</i>. In
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Wetmore</i>, the Court declared
          that this was the rule all along at common law.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Traditionally, property settlements were dischargeable in bankruptcy
          while periodic support payments were
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not </i>dischargeable in
          bankruptcy. In 1970, the law was changed to recognize the benefits of
          recognizing property settlements that were protected against
          discharge.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In the court�s view, did the Commission on Bankruptcy Law intend to
          shrink or expand traditional protection for families in 1978? They
          intended to broaden such protection! They were trying to expand the
          universe of nondischargeable support debts beyond periodic payments.
          Since Congress is taking its marching orders from the Commission, we
          figure Congress couldn�t have meant to constrain protection
          either.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court also says that the statute was passed in a hurry. The court
          concludes that Congress couldn�t have meant what it said. On the face
          of the language, this debt is dischargeable because it didn�t come to
          pass as part of a settlement agreement or divorce decree.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is one more piece of the puzzle: the bankruptcy laws are
          amended again in 1984 to include exactly the kind of agreement at
          issue in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Shine</i>. Was the
          1984 statute prospective or retroactive? It was
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">explicitly </i>prospective.
          Well, what�s the effect of that? The 1984 statute became effective for
          cases filed 90 days after its enactment. Does this show intent on the
          part of Congress <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> to fix
          their purported earlier screw-up?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What is the court saying about the 1984 language? They say that just
          because this law is explicitly prospective, it doesn�t mean that the
          law was any different before. The court urges us to compare this to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Wetmore</i>. The court says
          that the 1984 amendment simply carries forward the �true meaning� that
          the statute had <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">all along</i>.
          Do we buy this? Does the 1984 amendment make it easier or harder to
          support the court�s result in this case? If Congress was just doing
          �housekeeping�, wouldn�t they have said so?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Is there some rational basis for Congress to decide in 1978 to limit
          nondischargeability? Could Congress be trying to reduce post-marital
          �vitriol�? Maybe under some conditions there has been a meeting of the
          minds (an agreement) that should be enforced, as opposed to an order
          imposed from without.</span

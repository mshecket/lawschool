          action against the governor in regard to the federal Medicaid statute.
          The trial court awards a whole bunch of money for expert services, but
          the Court of Appeals says that the money is limited to $30 per

      <p>
        <span
          >What are the three statutory �pillars� here? What are the raw sources
          of authority? There is � 1988, which says that the prevailing party
          can recover �reasonable attorney fees� as part of its costs, and then
          a separate section that limits recovery to $30 per day�but how do we
          know that we�re allowed to get �costs�? Where do �costs� come from? �
          1920. That section gives the judge the right to defer the costs for
          the fees of witnesses. When we look at statutes together, we want to
          fit their pieces together. We have three different sections that fit
          together to give the applicable law.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >There is also a Supreme Court case that bears on this:
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Crawford</i> says what the law
          is for recovering witness fees unless Congress has said something
          explicit that goes beyond it. Does � 1988 explicitly provide the
          authority for attorney fees as part of costs? According to Scalia, it
          does not.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >This is a relatively rare opportunity for Scalia to write for the
          majority on a statutory interpretation manner. Scalia relies heavily
          on the meanings of certain terms in other statutes. Which of his
          arguments are most persuasive, and why? We have the TSCA, passed in
          the same year by the same Congress. What else was passed by the
          Congress that passed � 1988? They passed the CPSA. They passed the
          RCRA. All of these statutes seem to indicate that attorney fees and
          experts� fees were considered two different things.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How do we counter Scalia�s argument on textual lines? Well, these are
          big, complicated statutes, and there�s only a little bit on attorney
          fees. Also, different committees might have drafted different Acts,
          and those committees might have had different ideas about attorney
          fees. The committees involved in Equal Access for Justice is different
          than the committee that is involved with the environment. There are
          two separate committees involved!</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We have an attorney fee provision that is a small piece of two of the
          statutes and we have statutes being drafted by different committees.
          Can we make an argument that might at least question the apparent
          certainty of Scalia�s conclusion? What can we say about the structure
          of how Congress operates? We impute to Congress a knowledge that it
          might or might not have. When Congress passes major environmental
          legislation, they probably aren�t thinking about the details. What�s
          going on is that instead of having the Whole Act Rule, we have the
          �one-Congress fiction�. That is, we pretend that Congress, when it
          acts, intends to include or exclude just what it says. There are
          perfectly logical reasons why Congress might not have mentioned expert
          fees. They might not have been obsessed with these fees.</span

        <span
          >Does Scalia allow <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">any</i> role
          for legislative history? He says that the text is the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">best evidence</i> of purpose,
          and if the text is ambiguous you can look elsewhere. But people can
          reasonably disagree about whether the text really is ambiguous. It
          looks like Scalia is taking a more moderate position in order to get a
          majority of the Court. Scalia almost always thinks that the
          legislative history is totally worthless!</span

          >? It�s a 1989 Supreme Court case that says � 1988 allows separately
          billed paralegal and law clerk time as part of attorney�s fees. How
          does he distinguish the holding of that case from the holding here?
          Scalia is looking at ordinary past practice that attorneys are engaged
          in. Part of Scalia�s argument is that we understood what we were doing
          there because when attorneys bill their client, they include costs for
          their <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">own</i> employees. But
          Scalia says that that�s never been true for expert fees because
          experts are outside contractors who must be separately
          identified.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the efficiency argument? How does Posner counter? He says
          that using paralegals and law clerks lowers the overall cost of
          attorneys� services. Posner figured that if the Supreme Court didn�t
          allow compensation for attorneys, then it would force lawyers to
          become experts themselves. He thinks that can�t be what Congress
          meant. But at least some of the time, experts will actually be paid
          more than lawyers! That reinforces Scalia�s position that because they
          are so expensive, it would make sense that Congress would provide for
          them separately.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Posner suggests that Congress must have meant to allow attorneys to
          collect under costs all the specialized tasks that they�re not now
          doing. That�s a better general proposition for costs that are much
          less expensive when they�re not done by attorneys.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Scalia considers it unnecessary to consider the legislative history
          that Stevens trots out. Is there a provision in the committee report
          that suggests that Scalia may be reading the text too narrowly? What
          about floor statements? In whose favor do these statements cut? There
          are several places where at least two senators seem to resonate with
          the view that people need the means to go to court and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">be effective</i>. You can�t be
          effective without being able to bring the right resources to bear.
          Matthias refers to the �staggering cost of litigation�.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How significant should floor statements be in relation to committee
          reports? Are they more or less likely to be insincere? Who
          participates in the committee report who doesn�t play a role in the
          floor statements? Minority views are part of the committee report! But
          you can say anything you want in floor statements.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Is this �hot� or �cold� dialogue? Is this going on live on the floor,
          or is this �dropped into the record�? �Hot� dialogue has the chance
          for discussion, but there�s also the possibility for salesmanship that
          is absent with committee reports. You don�t want your boss to do
          something embarrassing on the floor because he or she didn�t
          understand what the real issues were.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Assuming that the committee reports had stated that citizens must be
          allowed to recover all costs including expert fees, would that change
          Scalia�s analysis or conclusion? He would say that if it was on their
          mind but then they decided not to put it into the final bill, then
          this is extra significant. Scalia is deeply suspicious of Congress. If
          Congress was very explicit, it would seem that they meant for
          something to be there.</span

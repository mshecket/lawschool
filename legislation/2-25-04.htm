      <p>
        <span
          >The issue in this case is whether the statute requires the carrier
          medium to be included in the weight required to get to the weight

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Easterbrook starts by conceding that including the weight of the
          carrier creates the possibility of some unusual results because the
          pure drug weighs almost nothing (this is what Posner will say later).
          How does Easterbrook deflect this concern in real world terms? He
          thinks that it might not be as bizarre as Posner thinks it is because
          drugs other than LSD are diluted at similar rates. Heroin is usually
          only 2-3% pure when sold on the street. Easterbrook wants us to know
          that he is sensitive to the potentially bizarre implications of how
          this sentencing scheme will be carried out before he engages in a
          bloodless textual analysis.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Easterbrook says if the results of textual analysis look absurd,
          people start to think that it�s time to get away from the text. So
          before Easterbrook goes off on his textual analysis, he wants to argue
          that the result is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> actually absurd.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Just what does the text say? Easterbrook says that the words of � 841
          can�t be made to apply only to the weight of the drug. What�s the
          significance of the phrase �detectable amount�? �Detectable�,
          according to Easterbrook, must mean �detectable inside of something
          else�. What about the word �mixture�? Should you consult a dictionary
          when you look at �ordinary meaning�?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What does �ordinary usage� mean to Easterbrook? It means the average
          understanding of the �average person� like you or me. How is that
          different from a congressional definition or a chemistry definition or
          a dictionary definition? The �ordinary meaning approach� is kind of
          resonant. But just what is that approach? A chemist would have a
          different understanding of �mixture� than a regular person, and also
          maybe different from a legislator.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Should we expect that if we look at a dictionary that the terms will
          be roughly comparable? There may be potential confusion. You hope for
          convergence, but there might not be.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Should we look at how a chemist approaches detection? Can we
          potentially make an argument about notice based on due process?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Would a <span class="SpellE">textualist</span> want to look at a
          definition at the time the statute is enacted?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This is an area where the
          <span class="SpellE">textualist</span> approach and the best answer
          approach are not too far apart. What is the most sensible way to look
          at law? You want it to govern people, especially in the criminal area,
          in a way that people can understand, especially when it comes to
          giving notice.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Just what dictionary do we use? Or do we want to look at lots of
          dictionaries? (Muted trumpet going: <span class="SpellE">wha</span>
          <span class="SpellE">wha</span> <span class="SpellE">wha</span>
          <span class="SpellE">wha</span>.)</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Dictionaries play a role here. These are questions that judges almost
          never ask. When the Supreme Court relies on dictionaries, you�ll find
          absolute chaos in terms of just what they are relying on. Some
          scholarly articles argue that the only thing that seems predictable is
          that you can always find dictionary definitions to support the
          position that you want to come to anyway.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We�re using dictionaries as a proxy for �ordinary meaning�. If we
          really need to, maybe we just look at as many dictionaries as
          possible. If there are conflicts, then maybe we don�t rely on
          dictionaries as much.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The same amount of LSD might get you 10 years if it�s in a mixture,
          but not 10 years if it�s in a substance. It seems weird to think that
          Congress would have intended such disparate results.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Is there another, stronger
          <span class="SpellE">textualist</span> dimension to this opinion that
          goes beyond words alone? What does Easterbrook do beyond looking at
          the meaning of individual words? He looks at the statute as a whole
          and the structure of the provision.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The last bit from Easterbrook�s point of view is that there may be a
          constitutional problem. We�ll spend more time later on the canon of
          avoiding constitutional problems and the rule of lenity.</span

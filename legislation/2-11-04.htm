          >We finished last time by identifying the types of lobbying under the
          1995 Act. This includes oral, written, or electronic information and
          covers officials. This is huge! Lobbying registration is up!</span

        <span
          >What�s the difference between � 5(b)(3) and � 5(b)(4)? For
          20,000-25,000 registrants every six months, this is a lot of
          information. The law attempts to make the information
          user-friendly.</span

      <p>
        <span

          who was lobbied by whom. Does the registrant have to disclose that?
          What does the registrant have to disclose?</span

          Will privacy be compromised?</span

      <p>
        <span

          influence the lobbyists, but rather the possibility of public
          shaming.</span

        <span>There was a pressure point, and then they gave in on it.</span>

        <span
          >What�s the range of money being spent by the entities during the
          period? $100,000 or so to $5.2 million! That�s a lot of money! Wow!

      <p>
        <span
          >Last time, we looked at Ginsburg and Breyer�s argument�s about the
          statute as a whole and found that the rule of lenity was considered a
          �tiebreaker� by Breyer. Ginsburg gave more weight to the rule of
          lenity.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We were asked to think about the three different justifications for
          the rule of lenity. For example, what about the �fair notice� concept?
          Do we need the fair notice justification for the rule of lenity to
          help decide this case? Breyer says that we don�t.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Should it really come as a surprise that if you�re dealing drugs out
          of your car having a gun in your car will get you five more years?
          Breyer is probably right: the fair notice function probably doesn�t
          add much to this.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the mens rea issue? How can you argue that someone
          traveling with a gun in a car doesn�t have the mens rea for this
          crime? The statute provides that if you are using a gun
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">during and in relation to </i>a
          crime, you�ll get the extra five years. Drug dealers are bad dudes! Do
          they really need notice? But maybe they get embroiled in a violent
          crime. What about the felony-murder rule?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the Second Amendment? We don�t
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">generally</i> criminalize gun
          possession. What�s the policy tag for the rule of lenity? Courts ought
          to be very careful to define criminal activity involving gun
          possession alone because that takes away more civil liberties. If
          Congress didn�t adequately or specifically define it, we�re taking
          away activity that implicates the Separation of Powers aspects of this
          rule.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Ginsburg was worried about vagueness here! You have the
          constitutional right to have a gun in your home or car. Then all of
          the sudden a drug deal happens! Is it fair that you may get five extra
          years just for having a gun around? Is Ginsburg right?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the word �brandish�? What does it mean to �brandish� a
          weapon?</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The majority looks at the original purpose of the statute. This is
          the federal mail statute. This is simply an expansion of a monetary
          category. Did Congress mean to create a whole new category of fraud in
          1909? If so, wouldn�t we have noticed some debate? But there wasn�t
          any such debate! From the point of view of the majority, this is just
          an expansion of the concepts of the earlier statute.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Stevens, in dissent, says there are
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">two different ways</i> of being
          guilty of mail fraud. It could be money or property,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">or</i> something else. He
          argues that the �or� must mean something! What are the public policy
          considerations? What are the rule of lenity considerations that
          support Justice White in the majority? Is this a political question
          doctrine consideration? Are we going to criminalize hardball politics?
          Each party will come out prosecuting the other party! This is a
          traditional Separation of Powers problem. We should be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">very clear</i> that Congress
          wants to do things this way before we put it into force. White felt
          that if he was wrong, Congress would fix it, and they did, real
          quick.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Which language canon could you use to get out of this? What about the
          presence of the word �or�? How about �conjunctive versus disjunctive�?
          How do you make that a Whole Act Rule argument? If you make two halves
          of a prohibitory section duplicative, it doesn�t make sense! Congress
          wouldn�t say that we prohibit �A� or �A�! They say that we prohibit
          �A� or �B�!</span

        <span
          >The NLRB ordered Catholic schools to bargain with unions. The Board
          only declines jurisdiction over religious schools when they are
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">completely </i>religious. The
          schools were found to be not
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">completely</i> religious
          because they had
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">some</i> secular classes. The
          Supreme Court says that under this rule, in effect, the NLRB could
          control <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">all</i> church schools.
          The Supreme Court overturns the NLRB!</span

      <p>
        <span
          >What is the applicable canon? Here we have the constitutional
          question doctrine. We should avoid any construction that would violate
          the Constitution. But if we don�t take it the way it�s intended, which
          other construction do we pick? Can we just pick
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">any</i> other construction out
          there in the world?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The majority does a fair amount of rewriting. The policy norm is
          valuable, but people are critical of the misuse of this canon. It
          creates superlegislative powers for the courts! If it�s possible
          something could be wrong, so matter how remote, the court gives itself
          the power to fix it!</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What does the Board suggest? The Board�s role if a unit has been
          recognized as a bargaining unit is to figure out what they�re going to
          be bargaining about, like terms and conditions of employment. But the
          school will say that, for example, we can�t give time off for
          Christmas because we have to take care of the poor on that day.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The position is that we don�t want to look at the record because it�s
          going to be automatic and has to happen. It�s almost like a legal
          conclusion. But can we avoid this? Can the Court reconfigure the
          statute? The Court looks at the legislative history to try to find a
          way out of this dilemma. In 1935, there was no expression by Congress
          to cover teachers in religious schools.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about a nurse who opposes unions on religious grounds? The
          majority contends that this amendment reflects sensitivity to First
          Amendment guarantees, supporting its position that Congress would have
          worried about such things. Can we argue that the 1974 amendment
          actually hurts the majority�s position?</span

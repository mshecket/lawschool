        <span
          >The 1974 Act provides for different ways in which contributions can
          be regulated because there are different kinds of contributions. One
          can contribute directly to a candidate or candidate�s campaign. There
          is a $1,000 ceiling on these contributions. The BCRA raised the
          ceiling to $2,000 per election (or $4,000 per election cycle).</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >You can also contribute to PACs, which are formed by corporations,
          interest groups, or issue groups. GM can have a </span

          There is a $5,000 per election ceiling on PAC contributions under the
          1974 Act. The PACs themselves can contribute $5,000 per election per
          candidate.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is also soft money. That is money that doesn�t directly benefit
          a specific campaign and isn�t spent in direct connection with such a
          campaign. For example, a national �get out the vote drive� or a party.
          No limits on soft money in the 1974 Act. In the following decades, the
          national committee organizers were known to be able to raise millions
          in a single evening in soft money by having $10,000 a plate dinners in
          which people would make a soft money contribution, not going to a
          particular candidate. That�s what BCRA was about. It was aimed at
          turning off the �spigot� of soft money. Under Title I of this new law,
          upheld by the Supreme Court last month, national political parties and
          their agents (state and local parties acting on behalf) barred from
          soliciting, receiving, spending soft money in elections. More later.

          interfered with a First Amendment right. The court found that the
          government interests were sufficiently compelling to justify the
          limitation. What�s the compelling government interest that justifies
          the limit?</span

      <p>
        <span

          the appearance of corruption. There is both actuality and

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the Brady Bill? The gun thing, right? It requires a seven day
          waiting period before buying certain guns in order to run background
          checks. This was a hotly contested bill. Say the NRA says to all
          Congress candidates that they won�t be given any money until they vote
          for or make clear that they�ll vote for repeal of the seven-day notice
          provision. Several candidates issue press releases saying that they�ll
          repeal, and they start getting money. Is this
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">quid pro quo</i> corruption? In
          some sense, it �smells� like a bribe�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Are the candidates just pledging to do that many voters want them to
          do? Is it a quid pro quo? Is it different to give money to reinforce
          views?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One way you know what public policies you stand for will be groups
          giving you a percentage positive voting record for a certain interest
          group. The way they know that is that certain votes are identified as
          critical. Money is part of the lubricant of representative
          democracy.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is a tension between what we expect to understand by quid pro
          quo corruption (smacks of a bribe) and on the other hand it�s rarely
          the status quo is unknown. Candidates usually have a track record and
          have a record of interest in public life. Groups come to them. You
          don�t go to a liberal Democrat if you�re a leading pro-life group. You
          don�t go to a conservative politician if you�re a civil rights
          coalition. Groups favor politicians who favor their views.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The NRA is an issue organization. They�re just pro-gun. They just
          support candidates who share their views on guns.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p><span>Let�s think about public policy questions.</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How do these contribution limits play out with respect to incumbents
          versus challengers? Are incumbents more effective or less effective
          with contribution limits in place? It would seem that contribution
          limits favor the incumbent. The incumbent has �franking privileges�
          related to sending mail. In any two-year House election cycle, the
          mail to constituents is far more frequent before an election than the
          rest of the cycle. There�s a limit.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>But people end up sending a
          lot of mail. Constituents want to know what�s going on. You don�t want
          to tell members that they can�t communicate with their
          constituents.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Not everything goes on in the public eye. It might not be corruption,
          but it might be the appearance of corruption. The casebook authors
          argue that if you only had a few large contributors you�d be free to
          act on all the issues that the large contributors don�t care about.
          The casebook authors are na�ve according to Brudney. But corporations
          and PACs care about everything, according to Brudney. Also, some think
          if you put together lots of contributions, you�ll get lots of people
          on both sides of every issue. There is not agreement on how it plays
          out.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What is or isn�t speech? The Court struck down the expenditure
          limitation. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Buckley</i>, the
          court makes distinctions between expenditure limits and contribution
          limits. That is fundamental.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What is it about contribution and the First Amendment? Contribution
          is directed at a candidate. What does that mean? Is a contribution
          less expressive or more expressive? The people giving money are
          voicing their opinion.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >It�s not free of controversy, but the Court makes it a legal fulcrum
          that if you are contributing money it doesn�t implicate the core of
          the First Amendment. If you give money to a candidate, it doesn�t
          matter how much money it is, you�ve given it to the candidate and the
          candidate is free to do whatever he or she wants with that money. Once
          you�ve finished contributing, you�re not in control of what�s said or
          how it�s said. The Court viewed expenditures as fundamentally
          different. Own money, own political views. Expenditure limits core
          First Amendment limit, strict scrutiny must be met.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court, in a variety of areas, when decide that something that is
          fundamental to individual rights is being threatened, they say there
          must be a compelling governmental interest narrowly tailored;
          regulation doing only as much as needs to do to preserve interest.
          Interest must be corruption, actuality or appearance. That�s the first
          thing the Court looks at in terms in expenditure limits. Doesn�t
          survive. Because unlike contributions which go to a particular
          candidate and therefore can be the perfect quid pro quo exchange,
          expenditures are made independent of any candidate. Less quid pro quo
          danger.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Is this persuasive? Say I spend my own money to make an ad urging
          people to vote Republican or a get-out-the-vote drive. Less quid pro
          quo threat than if gave money to Republican candidate? Will the
          candidate know if I spend money for get-out-the-vote drive? Would I
          hide it if I did it? What about disclosure issues? I presumably have
          some interest in how the public will perceive my role if I spend
          significant amount of money on activities like political commercials
          for DeWine paid for by so and so Brudney and not the views of the </span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Does the public care? Is this a distinction that matters?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about a voter registration drive that will help them enormously?
          The Supreme Court gradually wakes up to the fact that soft money
          expenditures are powerfully supportive of candidates just like
          candidate contributions. That�s not where the Court is in 1976,
          though.</span

      <p>
        <span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is another interest though: relative ability of groups to
          influence elections. Court�s judgment that prevention of corruption is
          sole possible justification for limiting political expenditures.
          Equalization absolutely unacceptable as a compelling interest in the
          opinion of the Court. Why?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court said that unlike corruption, against First Amendment
          rights. Why? Why is trying to promote equality of vote across the
          electorate incompatible with the First Amendment? The Court says that
          promoting equality won�t work because you�ll never get to the point
          where everyone is equal. There might be personal wealth on the part of
          the candidates.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But there�s a different reason. Why is the Court so hostile to
          efforts to promote equality of voice? The Court says that the First
          Amendment is only a negative restriction and not a positive
          pronouncement. The First Amendment is about freedom, which we can
          regulate to stop restrictions on freedom, but we won�t enhance the
          freedom of some to make others equal. This is a powerful statement by
          the Court, hotly debated since it was made. It shaped the landscape.
          If you�re not going to be allowed as a matter of Constitutional Law to
          promote those who have less resources to assure that the marketplace
          of ideas has rough equality of speakers or speaker intensity, then the
          fact that some are louder or richer becomes core protected First
          Amendment activity. That�s a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">key message</i> of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Buckley</i>. That�s why you
          can�t compel equality of voice as a key governmental interest.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >PACs were barely existing in the early 1970�s, but grew in the late
          1970�s to circumvent restrictions on contributions. There were two
          kinds of PACs: preexisting organizations like corporations and unions
          with a separate economic purpose, separateness due to Congress already
          regulated as early as 1907 that corporations couldn�t play a direct
          role in electoral politics, neither could unions as of 1947. Can�t
          pour out money into politician�s hands. Also, issue PACs. They are
          formed as conduits for funds collected from people who care a lot
          about the agenda of the group. The group is often only a group to
          express political views. Not NEA, not corporations, not formed for
          views. Issues PACs exist to express views that people who want to
          belong hope will become public policy. Therefore expenditures are
          expended by PACs to individual issues. PACs go bigger than individual
          in campaigns.</span

        <span

          They could be a way in which oil industry PAC, auto industry PAC, ways
          to bundle money from corporations to increase pressure on political
          process. Efforts to push level of PAC contributions down. But on the
          other hand, you might like PACs. How come?</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Are they individuals who believe in policies? NRA, GM, NEA? Broaden
          and deepen political participation. Bundle money from small
          contributions into big contributions. Candidates begin to care more
          about views of PAC members. Substantial spending by very wealthy as
          opposed to PACs help level playing field help express views. They are
          more issue-oriented, also can say that even with some of the more
          suspect PAC efforts, generally PACs are less venal than individual
          contributors to the extent an individual is paying money, question is
          �what are they getting out of it economically? Is it a payoff?� PACs
          appear to promote policy.</span

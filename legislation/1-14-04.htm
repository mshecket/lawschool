        <span
          >This is the most influential single factor. The longest single rule
          of any of the Senate rules deals with committee procedure. Up to
          80-90% of bills that are introduced die in committee. The committee
          report is the key explanation of what�s happened. It�s read by members
          and their staffs. It serves important functions in the �legislative
          enterprise�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Be aware of how important the filing of a report is: the Senate will
          basically never take up a bill unless a committee report has been
          written and filed. Even during floor deliberation, the committee�s
          role is central. The chair of the committee and the ranking minority
          member will manage the bill on the floor.<b

          in the same form in both houses, yet neither body is willing to accede
          to the other house�s version, you need to appoint a group to iron out
          the differences. In practice, the committee chair has the power to
          appoint the members of the conference committee even though this power
          is technically in the hands of the Speaker of the House and President
          of the Senate.</span

          all or nothing. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>They can�t
          just stick in language. Why not? What�s the policy justification? The
          conference isn�t meant to be a super-legislature that can override
          things that have been agreed to by the two big houses. We want the
          other members who aren�t in conference to be able to sleep at night
          knowing that their work won�t be messed with in an unexpected
          way.</span

          civil rights Bill. It was a weak bill, but at least he got the
          conversation going. Or, for example, when Bush introduces immigration
          reform, it�s significant even if the exact measures his administration

          There�s a wing of the Democratic Party, the Southern Democratic
          senators who were unhappy having to vote on so many bills that their
          constituents didn�t like. What they did in response was to go to the
          leader and tell him that �You can�t make us vote on all these things.

        <span
          >Duke Power has five departments. The Labor Department is by far the
          lowest-paying of the five. Before 1955, company policy allowed
          African-Americans to work only in the Labor Department. After 1955,
          company policy allowed African-Americans to work in other departments,
          but employees had to have a high-school diploma in order to get
          promoted to other departments.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >13 African-American employees brought suit against Duke Power. The
          claims of three of them are moot. Six others had no high school
          diplomas and were hired before 1955. The Fourth Circuit rules in their
          favor because whites in their department
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had </i>been promoted without
          diplomas and these African-Americans had not been allowed to be
          promoted without diplomas ever. They win, and we no longer need to be
          concerned with them.</span

          for the majority, says that these people don�t have a claim under
          Title VII. Sobeloff says that the conduct of the company towards these
          employees <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">is </i>a violation of
          Title VII. Sobeloff was the solicitor general under Eisenhower and he

          along with Thurgood Marshall.</span

        <span
          >What conduct does Boreman think the statute prohibits? What does
          Title VII ban in Boreman�s view? What is it that is illegal? Boreman�s
          view of Title VII is that it bars only
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">intentional discrimination</i>,
          in other words, conduct where the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">conscious aim</i> is to
          discriminate against a protected group.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How are the testing requirements justified? The testing requirements
          must have a

      <p>
        <span
          >Sobeloff wants to go further. He�s not only concerned with practices
          that have a conscious intent to discriminate, but with any conduct
          that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">functions</i> in a
          discriminatory manner. But �function� isn�t a �law word�. To be
          precise, Sobeloff says that the statute forbids practices that are
          �fair in form but discriminatory in substance�. In other words,
          conduct is forbidden if its
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">consequence</i>, though not its
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">intent</i>, is to exclude
          African-Americans.</span

        <span

          Congress had

          employer must <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">prove</i> that
          the diploma has a significant relationship to performance on the job.
          This is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">significant burden</i> on the
          employer and a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">significant difference</i>

          Hispanics, and Asians. If this requirement was challenged under Title
          VII, it would have to be proven
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">by the employer</i> that this

          there�s no intent to discriminate. Sobeloff would say that�s not

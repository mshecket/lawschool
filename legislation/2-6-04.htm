          >One�s view of the value of lobbying is affected by how you view the
          legislative process and how a legislator should relate to her
          constituents. If you think that a legislator is an agent rather than a
          trustee, should we be regulating lobbying, and why? What might we be
          worried about by lobbying? Lobbying could possibly lead to the
          appearance of corruption. That�s the only basis for regulating
          lobbying that spawned the 1946 Act. It turns out that the 1946 Act
          prohibited more or less
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">nothing</i>. It�s worth asking
          whether disclosure alone can really be enough to regulating lobbying.
          The assumption is that disclosure is a �disinfectant�.</span

          People collect money for the purpose of advancing or defeating
          legislation. Is there anything on its face that covers direct versus
          grass roots lobbying? The text says �directly or indirectly�, which
          would seem broad enough to cover people who act indirectly through
          constituents in a grass roots context. But that�s not how the Supreme
          Court reads the language.</span

          points out that the Court is adding and subtracting words. How come?
          Are they trying to avoid a constitutional argument? What would be that

          the number of people who registered as lobbyists jumped. Now it�s

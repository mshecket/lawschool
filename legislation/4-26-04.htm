          >There will be three essay questions that are similar in approach to
          the exams on reserve. There are about five exams available. The first
          question will be a very long hypothetical. Don�t assume that it tracks
          real-world substantive law. It will include statutes, legislative
          history, and stuff like that. You don�t need substantive knowledge
          about the area of law tested. We will need to apply common sense and
          statutory interpretation tools. We�ll be asked to argue both sides of
          the issue, just as a lawyer would. We must construct a persuasive case
          for both the petitioners and the respondents. There will be plenty of
          arguments to be found on both sides. A strong answer for either
          position will make the best affirmative case for your own side that
          includes text and context and also
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">briefly</i> deflect or
          discredit the best argument for the opposite side. You can�t ignore
          the other side�s position if they have something highly creditable or
          may be viewed as such.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >As a lawyer, we�ll make as many arguments that we thing are
          persuasive to make for each side. There�s a thick handful of arguments
          on each side. Some allow you to go more in-depth than others. Some
          points may be more persuasive than others. You also must argue the
          question as an attorney and not a theoretician. Do it the way courts
          do it. Your philosophy should not inform your answer to the first
          question. If you think one side has stronger textual arguments, make
          those arguments. But don�t inject your philosophy in this question;
          you�ll get your shot in question three.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >There is a second, shorter essay question that will also give a
          factual pattern. It will deal with bribery, lobbying, and campaign
          finance and will have a substantive focus. We need to know the effects
          of the BCRA. We only need to know about the provisions we studied in
          class. The third question will be the normative question. We will be
          asked to jump into the fray of a philosophical question. We may refer
          to cases that we�ve read or theories that we�ve studied. Brudney will
          ask us to react to something that�s �out there� and apply it.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Brudney is looking for issue spotting, analysis of the issues, and
          strong organization. The test is open book and open notes. You may
          look something up if you want. You can use a computer, but you must
          turn in the printed examination at the end of the exam time. You get a
          little less time because you have to go and print.</span

          office hours coming up. If you want to talk about old exams, feel
          free. Brudney will be out of town Thursday and Friday. He�ll even come
          in Saturday morning if anyone wants to talk.</span

          application. We have this �National Bank Act�. National Banks can
          charge out-of-state credit card customers a higher rate than in-state
          customers. But can the banks charge late payment fees that are legal
          in their own state but not legal in the cardholder�s state?</span

          >Is this a �step one� or a �step two� problem under
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Chevron</i>? They say that the
          statute is ambiguous, and thus the court must show deference to the
          agency�s interpretation as long as it�s not too far off the mark.
          Scalia concludes that the word �interest� is ambiguous. Does he reach
          that conclusion based on his own analysis, or based on something else?
          He starts out by saying that this can�t be a �step one� problem
          because �interest� is ambiguous. This is kind of like the
          Stevens/Scalia debate about the word �take�. He presumes that the
          statute is ambiguous due to the dissenting opinions in lower court
          judgments.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >If you look at the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Casey</i> decision, Scalia
          wrote this opinion for the majority as well. That case involved
          whether expert fees were included in � 1988. Did Scalia conclude that
          a conflict in the lower courts was
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">per se</i> evidence of
          ambiguity in the text? He concluded in that case that the statutory
          phrase was unambiguous even though Posner had a Seventh Circuit
          opinion suggesting the exact opposite. Why is Scalia more willing to
          posit ambiguity here? What�s the default rule? We�re talking about
          reasonable attorney�s fees in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Casey</i> and we have a split
          in the Circuits. Here, we have a term that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">no court</i> has disagreed with
          the Supreme Court�s view, yet we still find the word ambiguous.</span

        ><span
          >was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> an agency case. In
          that case, the Court was avoiding looking at legislative history.
          Scalia hates legislative history! In
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Casey</i>, the statute is
          directly interpreted. If the statute is sufficiently unambiguous, we
          don�t have to look at legislative history. If the statute
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">here</i> is ambiguous, we look
          at the agency interpretation,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> legislative history. So
          going to �step two� depends on whether the Court is willing to review,
          with rigor, the textual argument. In this case, Scalia is not prepared
          to do that. That doesn�t mean that he will always find clarity when
          the alternative is legislative history and that he
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">won�t</i> find clarity when the
          alternative is agency analysis. So look at what �step two� involves
          and that can give you a clue as to whether you�ll get there. Scalia
          thinks that the text is clear most of the time.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >In part III, Scalia decides that it�s reasonable that late fees are
          included in the definition of interest. He relies on
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">really old </i>law
          dictionaries. Did those sources expressly include late fees within
          their definition? Nope. There�s no reference to credit cards. We�re
          looking at compensation that is paid to the lender by the borrower for
          the use of the money. The failure to reference late fees doesn�t mean
          that they�re automatically
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">included</i>. They may have
          automatically been
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">excluded</i> as usurious. It
          might have been useful to look at modern dictionaries, especially
          because a 1995 regulation is at issue. If there
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had</i> been some reference to
          contemporary dictionaries, the Court might have said that it�s not the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">preferred</i> meaning, but it
          might not be so wacky as to be an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">unreasonable </i
          >interpretation.</span

        <span
          >The petitioner makes several arguments for why the ordinary rule of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Chevron</i> deference should
          not be followed. First off, the regulation was issued very long after
          the original statute was passed. But Scalia says that this doesn�t
          matter. This is a reminder to us that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Chevron</i> has changed the
          terms of why it�s legitimate to refer to an agency. The litigant says
          that you can�t rely on this because it�s 100 years old! Why is age or
          length of time not discrediting anymore in the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Chevron</i> analysis? Congress
          left ambiguity in the statute so that the agency could interpret it
          over time. What�s new in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Chevron</i> is the Court�s view
          that the executive branch is also a politically-accountable branch
          that deserves deference unless its interpretations are
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">patently</i>
          unreasonable.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Lastly, why is the inconsistency in the agency position okay? What�s
          the justification for an agency change of position? Does the Court say
          that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Chevron</i> allows for
          changes in the agency�s thinking over time? Sure, if there�s a good
          reason for them to change it, then they should. What�s a good reason?
          Change isn�t bad <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">per se</i>.
          How would the dynamic school of interpretation react to Scalia saying
          that changes in agency interpretation as long as they�re not sudden
          and unexplained? They would like it! Agencies are given a wide berth
          to update based on the circumstances, assuming that they are
          accountable politically in a way that courts are not.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >So we�ve covered the practical aspects of interpreting statutes.
          Brudney proposes that legislatures have some kind of coherence. In
          legislation, as in almost any other area of the law, the world turns
          out to be very complicated. Bright lines and per se rules would be
          nice, but human conduct isn�t nice or neat. It�s full of all sorts of
          complex cross-currents and messiness. Our job will be to make sense
          out of the messiness on the exam and in real life.</span

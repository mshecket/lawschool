          all if we have a � 703(a)(1). This suggests that the legislature was
          trying to say
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">two different things</i>, thus
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"

          fiction�, but it�s necessary. All of this can be contested.</span

          That doesn�t mean that people don�t spend a lot of time on �context�,

        <span

          of the circumstances of Tower�s speech. He was probably speaking to an
          empty chamber with no C-SPAN. He was sort of just talking to himself,
          but not entirely. We can be reasonably confident that there are always
          staff members on the floor to make sure that things don�t run amuck.
          The speech will also go into the Congressional Record in any
          case.</span

          amendment, the first of which was defeated.</span

          seems to want to water down the bill. The floor managers rejected the
          amendment. Then the senator changed the amendment and got it accepted.
          That suggests that the final amendment was watered down.</span

          promoted some of the proceduralist hurdles. He wanted them to act as
          �roadblocks� against tyranny by the majority against the minority.

          would be pleased with. Take, for example, the flag burning debate
          about a decade ago. The House rammed through a proposed constitutional
          amendment, but on the other hand, the Senate held months and months of
          hearings. Instead of a constitutional amendment, they passed a
          statute. But the Supreme Court invalidated the statute, and by that
          point the popular fervor had died down considerably. On the other
          hand, filibusters aren�t in the Constitution. The House and Senate
          rules don�t come from the Constitution. Skeptics contend that the
          procedures that flow out of deadlocks and obstacles actually do the
          opposite of what </span

          would have wanted. The argument is that procedural hurdles will block
          majority legislation by the veto of the minority, but it won�t block
          �special interest� legislation with a veto of the silent
          majority.</span

          society leading to interest group formation and in turn the dispersal
          of powers among the social, economic, and political fabric of our
          society. Interest groups are frequently in conflict, and government is
          the arena where interest group conflict gets played out. How can this
          be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">good</i> from a public
          policy perspective? It is argued that there is a �marketplace of
          ideas�, and if people peacefully compete to promote different ideas
          and public policy alternatives then it follows that the groups will
          successfully work out conflicts. The suggestion is that we can resolve
          our argument if we get everyone at the table.</span

          will tend to be better organized and more powerful. Better organized

          preference ordering, agenda-setting power (the order of the votes) and
          strategic voting based on superior information will carry the day.

          didn�t intend that the statute would apply to any such people? This
          seems to suggest that Congress had a bigger picture of labor than mere

          >If we were trying to decide whether to allow foreign pastors into
          this country, what would the legislature and interested parties have
          said? Far from wanting to keep pastors out, we probably would have
          wanted them to bring them in. We wanted to convert Catholics to
          Protestants.</span

          the members of the legislature and the interest groups (or

          is a �Christian Nation�. The current Supreme Court probably wouldn�t
          feel the same way to say the least. It�s a big step from �we won�t
          exclude Christian ministers� to �we

          from �may pay� or �should pay� or �will pay�. �Shall� is a

        <span
          >There is a concern that the plain language might conflict with
          purpose. The respondent believes this act is primarily compensatory.
          If that�s so, then if we give $300,000 for a $400 back pay claim, that
          <span class="SpellE">ain�t</span> compensatory. Therefore, it is
          argued, a literal approach will fly in the face of the claimed purpose
          of the statute.</span

        <span
          >Rehnquist disagrees. He believes that Congress has chosen to secure
          their compensatory purpose through arguably punitive means.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What is Rehnquist arguing? Is he arguing that plain meaning should be
          used because when it is clear on its face it trumps everything else in
          the �funnel�? Or should plain meaning be used because it furthers the
          �purpose� of the act? Does Rehnquist use a �softer� form of plain
          meaning? Does he suggest that something
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">could</i> trump plain meaning,
          but it just doesn�t here? Scalia, Easterbrook, and others will take a
          harder-edged view of the plain meaning rule. Rehnquist has cited to
          legislative history and is prepared to say that sometimes plain
          meaning can be trumped by other stuff.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the legislative history of this act? Is this the same kind
          of legislative history that we were looking at in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Holy Trinity</i>? No. What
          Rehnquist is calling legislative history is the successive textual
          changes to the act. It�s sort of �vertical� legislative history. It�s
          what happened to the text over time. He doesn�t look at committee
          reports or floor debates. We tend to look at �horizontal� legislative
          history: we look at comment on a statute that is currently under
          consideration. That�s what
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Holy Trinity</i> was
          about.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So if you see courts talking about legislative history in
          jurisdictions were committee reports and floor debates and such are
          not recorded, they are probably talking about this sort of �vertical�
          legislative history.</span

          period. This is a change from previous versions. There is no �up
          to�.</span

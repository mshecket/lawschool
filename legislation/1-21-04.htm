          >Last Friday, at the end of class, we were talking about the tension
          over the meaning of discrimination. Discrimination can mean simply
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">differentiation</i>. Does the
          statute protect members of the majority from
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">differentiation</i> too? Or is
          the statute designed only to protect against
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">prejudice</i> and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">invidious discrimination</i>?
          If that�s so, maybe the statute is only applicable to discrimination
          against minorities by the majority.</span

          isn�t <span class="GramE">so</span> clear as you might think. Instead,
          Brennan grants the plain meaning, but finds that some things can be
          outside the �spirit� of the act. Can he do that? What�s the basis of
          saying that something is within the letter of the law but we can
          ignore plain meaning? How could you justify this?</span

          will guide us unless what the statute says is unconstitutional. But
          who gets to decide what�s incompatible with the purpose? Should courts
          avoid results that are inconsistent with those that Congress
          apparently had in mind?</span

          VII? If the goal is to integrate blacks into the economy, then Brennan
          is willing to attribute a wider set of means to Congress than just
          race-blind employment practices. Brennan is willing to say that
          race-conscious hiring is okay if it tries to rectify past

          is Brennan talking about when he talks about �traditional business

          They enacted <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">one word</i>, not

          that it also preserves business freedom. But he anchors part of his

          analysis would displace

          Brennan�s version. Rehnquist would forbid more conduct that was

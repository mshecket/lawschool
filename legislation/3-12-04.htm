          630(f) of the ADEA? What about the canons of avoiding irrational or
          unconstitutional results? Couldn�t elected judges be unseated by the
          voters? So isn�t it irrational to treat appointed judges differently?
          Could this fail the rational basis test? Only a

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">fairly reasonable</i>

          says that the states don�t need any extra judicial protection under
          the Tenth Amendment. The present case was heard at a time when

          earlier, the Court said that the political process resolves all issues
          of dual sovereignty. Now the Court is creating a canon application
          whether a constitutional problem
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">could</i> have been created, so
          it must be avoided.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Where are we? It would be easy to take Llewellyn�s table and say that
          canons should be completely debunked. But canons influence the
          development of a law. Judges rarely decide cases solely on language
          canons. But why do judges rely on such canons? Do canons effectively
          constrain judges? Judges like them and use them. Maybe the canons are
          a kind of a �checklist� to stimulate reflection on the meaning of
          words.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Public choice theorists have a different take on this. They believe
          that judges have policy preferences even if they couch them in more
          principled terms. Canons come into play when judges don�t have a clear
          point of view. Why might they not have a clear point of view? Maybe
          the case isn�t in one of their areas of expertise. If the courts are
          construing statutes on very different subjects, the canons can relieve
          them of the need to get detailed knowledge of such subjects.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >If you don�t know exactly what Congress meant, you give Congress the
          chance to speak again. For example, Brudney found that canons were
          used very frequently in ERISA cases where the language was very
          complicated. When using canons, are you just masking the fact that you
          don�t know what you�re talking about?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The canon debate reflects a tension between law and politics or the
          perception of law and politics. Are canons just easy recourse to
          things that �look law-like�?</span

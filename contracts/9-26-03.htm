          >Mr. Michael hired Ms. Fitzpatrick to be a nurse, chauffeur,
          companion, and so on. He promised to pay her $8 a week and then give
          her a bunch of his stuff upon his death. His relatives �poison his
          mind� and he tries to kick her out of the house.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The plaintiff has difficulties in getting her stuff. There is a
          statute of frauds issue because Michael has promised her a �life
          interest� in his land, and you can�t orally promise to sell someone
          land. There is other stuff that is promised that does not fall under
          the statute of frauds.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p><span>It�s not a written promise; it�s an oral promise.</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >She may have a statute of frauds problem with the cars. It is a
          promise on Michael�s part to sell goods, but it�s hard to tell what
          the price was. If the price of the cars was over $500, there is a
          statute of frauds problem with respect to those big-ticket (for 1939)
          goods.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So the remedy at law is just about as inadequate as can be. The
          contract is mostly within the statute of frauds, and the statute of
          frauds is not satisfied. However, the statute of frauds does not cover
          equitable remedies. At law, it looks like she can only get
          restitution.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >She gave him value, and he is in breach because he fired her without
          cause. But she has received $8 a day and room and board for the time
          she had worked for him so far. Probably, therefore, she isn�t going to
          get restitution. So that�s not the interest she wants; she wants the
          expectation interest. That interest is, of course,
          <i>much</i> bigger.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The attorney claims that she has partly performed the contract and
          has received money from Michael, and therefore the agreement is
          <i>out</i> of the statute of frauds. However, that�s not exactly what
          we mean by �part performance� in the case of land deals. It�s more of
          a term of art.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >When you have an oral contract for land and you pay 10% or 20% of the
          price, that doesn�t get you out of the statute of frauds. You cannot
          enforce the promise if it is a strictly oral contract.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So what Fitzpatrick wants is equitable relief. She�s not going to get
          it, even though it is plain that relief at law is inadequate. So why
          doesn�t she get relief at equity?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court says that it won�t force continued association between
          these people who obviously find each other obnoxious. We shouldn�t use
          the power of the government to force two people to associate with each
          other. Michael doesn�t want anything more to do with her. He
          <i>would</i> have to pay money damages if there weren�t statute of
          frauds problems, but there is <i>no equitable relief</i>.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Watch out! This is an employment (or personal services) contract.
          There is one kind of specific performance that you are
          <i>not going to get</i>. There will <i>never</i> be an injunction
          forcing an employee to work. The 13<sup>th</sup> Amendment forbids
          ordering someone to work; this would be considered involuntary
          servitude.</span

      <p>
        <span

          <i>Fitzpatrick</i>, the employee wants to force the employer to allow
          her to work. In the real world, every day, we force employers to take
          employees back who they have wrongfully discharged.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Consider, for example, a case where an employer fires someone on the

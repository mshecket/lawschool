        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span> Freund made a contract with </span
        ><st1:Street
          ><st1:address><span>Washington Square</span></st1:address></st1:Street
        ><span>
          to publish a book. The terms included a $2,000 advance upon delivery
          of the manuscript and an agreement to publish the work in hardcover
          and paperback editions. Freund in fact delivered the manuscript and
          collected the $2,000, but the defendant did not publish the book. The
          plaintiff sued at first for specific performance of the contract. The
          trial judge denied specific performance but granted a trial for
          monetary damages. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½</span>The
          plaintiff sued for damages stemming from a delay of his academic
          promotion, loss of royalties, and the cost of publication if he had
          published the book himself. The trial court awarded him the cost of
          publication but not the other two elements. The plaintiff appealed,
          and the appellate court upheld the verdict 3-2, with the minority
          holding that the plaintiff should recover only nominal damages.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Should the author be able to recover the cost of publishing the book
          himself?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Damages are not awarded based on the benefit to the breaching party,
          but rather according to the consequences of the breach to the
          plaintiff.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court argues that the plaintiff expected two things from the
          performance of the contract: the advance and royalties. The author
          already has his advance, and the court says that damages for lost
          royalties cannot be awarded because insufficient evidence was
          presented at trial to support how much he might get.

        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The plaintiff may only recover nominal damages.</span>

<p><span>For
today, we’re going to have Torts class: “what you should have learned in Torts.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
will learn about the tort of fraud or deceit. What is the “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraud exception</i>”? For one thing, it’s an exception to the parol
evidence rule. You can prove fraud, and
the parol evidence rule is not going to block your doing that. Check out § 214 (d): You <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>may </i>introduce evidence that, among other things, a contract should
be invalidated due to fraud. You could
also introduce evidence that you were <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>coerced</i>
into signing, that there was a lack of consideration, that the contract was
illegal, or that contract terms were entered into by mistake.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The elements of the tort of fraud</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
must be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>misrepresentation</i> of a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>material fact</i> done with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>scienter</i> (serious reprehensible fault on
the part of the liar as opposed to innocent mistake). There must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>reliance</i> on the part of the victim. There must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>damage </i>or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>loss</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
a simple hypo: say </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> makes a contract with me to
sell his horse Dobbin. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> says he’s had him examined
by a vet recently and that he’s in good shape. On the other hand, the horse is ten years old and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> is selling him <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as is</i>. If Dobbin was in good health, he would be worth $12,000. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> sells the horse to me for
$10,000. But </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> lied: he had gone to the
vet, but the vet said that he’s about to croak. So it turns out Dobbin is worth $50 dead. So the horse died. First you say “damn”. “Then you make a disparaging remark about my
parentage.” Then you seek a remedy.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
you look at the writing, it has disclaimer and merger clauses. Does that mean that I can’t get a
remedy? I probably can’t as a matter of contract,
but I may be able to as a matter of tort. The tort of fraud or deceit has been committed. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> misrepresented a material
fact (the horse’s condition). He did it
with a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ton</i> of scienter (he lied and
knew darn well he was lying). I relied
on </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s statement and I suffered actual damages. One measure of damages would be how much I
paid minus what I actually got. That
will get me $9,950.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
I was induced to sign by </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s fraud, then the writing
can be set aside and I can get damages under the tort of fraud.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the other hand, sometimes the victim can simply rescind. That’s often fine, but in this case it’s too
late because the horse has died. It may
be too late to rescind, but not too late to get damages. So this is a really simple, garden variety
example.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It’s
relatively to allege fraud, even if you have to allege it with
particularity. But it might be quite
hard to prove. In this case, there was
clearly fraud and there will be no problem proving it. For example, you can put the vet on the witness
stand.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
damages that </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> has suggested are
$9,950. That’s the “out of pocket” rule. A minority of jurisdictions have the “out of
pocket” rule, while a majority of jurisdictions have “benefit of the bargain”
rule. The victim needs $9,950 to get him
back to square one. On the other hand,
the “benefit of the bargain” rule would give the victim $11,950, giving the victim
the benefit of the good bargain that he made with the wrongdoer. The “benefit of the bargain” is like the expectation
interest and protects your profit if you can prove it. If the facts are right, the victim can get
more of a recovery under the “benefit of the bargain” rule.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
a more complicated kind of fraud that frequently comes up in a contractual
setting. Say when </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> sells me Dobbin, our
writing contains a merger and limitation clause that says the whole writing is
included in our agreement. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> promised me orally, but not
in writing, that Dobbin was a purebred and that shortly after sale </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> would deliver the
registration papers to me. Assume with
the papers Dobbin is worth $11,000, and worth $7,000 without. Say I pay the agreed price of $10,000, and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> fails to delivers the
papers. Could I sue him for breach of
contract? It will be hard to recover
because it runs right into the merger clause, which says “this writing is all
there is.” The writing also said that
Dobbin was being sold “as is”. It would
be pretty tough to get anywhere on a contract theory.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you try it as a tort case, on the other hand, was there any misrepresentation
of a material fact? No, in most
cases. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> made and broke a
promise. If that’s all there is, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> is not a frauder. If he makes a promise and later decides to
break it, it will be a breach of contract, but that’s not fraud.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
do we get fraud into the picture? We
only get fraud when </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> makes a promise with a
present intent to break that promise. Then </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> has misrepresented a
material fact, namely, his intention. If
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s present intent is to break a promise, then you
are someone who has misrepresented a material fact. There’s also scienter there when you make a
promise while at the same time intending to break it. This is sometimes (somewhat inaccurately)
called “promissory fraud”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So,
if you could prove that at the moment when Clovis made his promise to deliver
Dobbin’s registration papers he intended to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>break</i>
that promise, then you have a fraud case. If you have a good fraud case, you’ll have a chance to rescind the contract
and get damages. If you can’t show that
intent, you’re stuck.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Damages
would be $3,000 under the “out of pocket” rule, and $4,000 under “benefit of
the bargain” rule given the facts as stated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span><a
href="lipsitvleonard.htm">Lipsit v. Leonard</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New Jersey</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> court applies </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, and in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the “out of pocket” rule
is applied. Lipsit was Leonard’s
employee for about eight years under a series of annual letter agreements. Lipsit wants to recover from Leonard for
Leonard’s failure to give him a share of the business. Lipsit did receive a salary or wages, but he
didn’t get his promised share in the business. Lipsit gives it a shot both as a matter of contract and as a matter of
tort. Attorneys like to try to make
cases on more than one theory.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Lipsit
strikes out pretty badly on the contract basis, according to the New Jersey Supreme
Court. The Supreme Court finds this
theory not worth talking about much. Why
is it so clear that Lipsit gets nowhere on the contract theory of
recovery? Think about a couple of things
that happened.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
these writings, something was said about Lipsit getting a share in the
business. He’ll get nowhere on the basis
of what was said there. First off, an
agreement to agree is not enforceable. Also, the contract terms are quite vague. The promises are abundantly illusory. The parties will do what they want if they
feel like it. That’s not really a contract
at all. If you try to enforce the
writing, there’s nothing there to enforce and you go “wee wee wee all the way
home”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Lipsit
says: “Well, each time we signed one of these agreements, Leonard also agreed
orally in no uncertain terms that he would give me a 10% interest in the
business.” What happens if you try to enforce
these oral agreements on the basis of the law of contracts? You run right into the parol evidence rule. The issue of getting a stake in the business is
covered in the writings, and you’re trying to introduce a contemporaneous oral
agreement that contradicts the writing.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
does Lipsit get somewhere? He’ll have to
resort to the law of torts. Making a
promise and breaking it is not a misrepresentation of a material fact, but making
a promise with the intent to break it when you make it and using it to induce
service on the part of an employee could be a valid suit on the theory of
torts. The argument would be that
Leonard intended to break his promises when he made them, causing Lipsit to
rely on the promises. Lipsit continued
his employment. Finally, if Lipsit doesn’t
get a stake, he will suffer damages.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
how do we measure the damages here? It
was easy to calculate damages in the horse example. But how do we do it here under the “out of
pocket” rule? What did the victim
give? What did the victim get? Lipsit gave his services, and got paid. We need to value his services and compare
that to what Leonard paid him. If we can
value Lipsit’s services (in the labor market) at <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>more</i> than he was paid, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>difference
</i>is his “out of pocket” loss. In a “benefit
of the bargain” jurisdiction, Lipsit could go after the value of a share of the
business. In a “benefit of the bargain” jurisdiction,
you get <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>what you were promised</i> minus
what you got.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court notes that Lipsit will have some problems of proof on remand, but says
that he’s entitled to try. On the other
hand, in a “benefit of the bargain” jurisdiction, you may have trouble proving
what you were promised. But you’ll be
able to try to prove “out of pocket” loss even though you’re theoretically
entitled to more.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Would
it make any difference in this case if the writings that the parties had signed
had said: “These agreements are fully enforceable, even though induced by
fraud.” No. That’s the case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Sabo v. Delman</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
can you do in draft a contract that could prevent fraud by the other
party? You can try to negate one of the
elements of the tort of fraud so there is no tort. Many people try to negate the element of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reliance</i>. There is a clause written into the contract
saying that one party does not rely on the statements of the other party.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span><a
href="lafaziavhowe.htm">LaFazia v. Howe</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Howes purchase a deli from LaFazia and Gasrow. The Howes want to find out how much money the deli is making. The Howes ask, and the sellers say that they
don’t keep good books. The Howes say: “What
about your tax returns?” The sellers say
that the tax returns show earnings that are lower than they actually are. The Howes have a deli-expert friend look at
the documents and they’re told it’s not a viable business. But the Howes buy the deli anyway for
$90,000.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
writing that the parties sign contain a non-reliance clause and an merger
clause. The Howes have another
problem! They were represented by
counsel. Their son was a lawyer, and he
had a chance to look at the writing. They
had plenty of opportunity to see what they were doing, but signed anyway. The Howes tried to prove fraud. They wanted to prove that the sellers made
fraudulent misrepresentations, but they’re missing the element of reliance.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court has a lot upon which to hang its hat. The buyers must have known that the sellers were somewhat dishonest and
they had a good idea that the deli was not a good buy.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Various
judges have different feelings about reliance clauses. If you try to reconcile the cases on the
basis of not only the doctrine, but the facts, you’ll find that in the cases
where the non-reliance clause was enforced, but also there was factually very
little reliance in the case. The victim
knew or ought to have known that any representations about the manner in question
weren’t meant to be taken very seriously.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
opinion talks a lot about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Danann Realty</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
tort of fraud can be a way <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>around </i>the
parol evidence rule. Or you can simply
think about it this way: when you have the tort of fraud, and when it’s proved
(sometimes beyond the preponderance of the evidence and pleaded with
particularity), you need to be compensated. You either should be allowed to rescind or you should be able to get damages.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
sellers don’t look like nice people in this case, but it also doesn’t look like
they deceived the Howes. If something
serious that ought to be relied upon had been said and relied upon and there is
a non-reliance clause in the writing, the court may allow a tort claim to go
forward. The court might say that the
clause is “boilerplate” and “non-specific”. But in reality, the court might really be drawing a line and saying that
you can’t perpetrate fraud with impunity. But these are just </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s musings.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Another
exception to the parol evidence rule is found in § 214 (e): parol evidence can
be used to rescind or reform contracts. If we have a writing and it describes an agreement for the purchase and
sale of 400 bales of cotton to arrive on the Peerless, can the parties admit
evidence that the seller meant the later Peerless and the buyer meant the
earlier Peerless, thus there is no meeting of the minds? Sure, they can do that under § 214 (d), and
claim that there is an invalidating clause, or they can do it under § 214 (e),
saying that there was no meeting of the minds, either subjective or objective.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are three kinds of mistake we will learn about in this course. We’ll need to learn to identify and
distinguish all three types.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>First
you have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a href="rafflesvwichelhaus.htm">Raffles
v. Wichelaus</a></i> – a “failure to communicate” kind of mistake.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Another
type will be found in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hoffman v. Chapman</i>.
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The parties reach agreement and having
done so, they integrate their agreement. They merge it into a writing, and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>make
a mistake in integration</i>. They make
a mistake in writing down just what they agreed to. They screw up the writing. In those circumstances, in a proper case, we’ll
grant reformation. We will <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reform</i>, or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>fix</i> or correct the writing if it fails to reflect the parties’
underlying agreement. We’ll make it so
that it conforms to the underlying agreement.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
this case, you learn that the parol evidence rule does not bar a claim in
reformation. Does this go too far? Tomorrow, we’ll look at the various
safeguards that are imposed on this doctrine that we can learn from this case.</span></p>

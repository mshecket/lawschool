          the opportunity for a hearing. The need of the plaintiff must be very
          compelling. Usually TROs last not more than ten days.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If the plaintiff still needs protection, they�ll go for a preliminary
          injunction (AKA temporarily injunction, interlocutory injunction, or
          injunction <i>pendente lite</i>). The idea of this is to keep things
          as close to the way they are as possible in order to assure that the
          plaintiff�s harm can be corrected where it might not be possible
          otherwise.</span

        <span

          defendant to figure out whether these equity orders are
          appropriate.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >These types of orders don�t fit well with due process. Therefore,
          there are a few safeguards. The plaintiff sometimes has to put down
          money for an �injunction bond� which basically guarantees that the
          defendant won�t be hurt if the injunction is struck down. Also, in
          some jurisdictions you can actually appeal an injunction even though
          it isn�t a �final� decision.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >These types of orders give more power and flexibility to trial
          judges. But sometimes they can heavily burden defendants. It is hard
          to review trial judge�s decisions about equity relief in advance of
          trial, but the appeals court might yell at them if they don�t do the
          right thing.</span

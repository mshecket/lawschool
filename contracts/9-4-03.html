<p><b><span>Some
problems</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Problem
1: a consumer repudiates an agreement to sell a used car to another consumer. Carl Consumer agrees to sell a Camry to
Mother for $7000. The market price of
the Camry is $8200. Mother puts $100
down. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Carl repudiates.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>First
off, is the agreement enforceable? You
can find out from the Statute of Frauds.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a contract for the sale of goods. Unless there is something written down to show there’s a contract, the
contract is no good <i>unless</i> one of the parties has either made a payment
or delivered goods (among other things).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So,
a part payment has been made for these goods. Shouldn’t we have a problem with this? Check out the Statute of Frauds.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
we’ve decided there’s an enforceable contract, so Mother has a shot against
Carl Consumer.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
are the buyer’s remedies? § 2-711 (1) –
if the seller fails to make delivery, the buyer can “cover” and collect damages
in addition to getting restitution. The
buyer must “cover” in a reasonable amount of time.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
our example, the buyer did cover, and it certainly seems reasonable because it
was a “remarkably similar” car, and it was purchased at slightly below market
price. The damages that Mother will get
will amount to the cover price minus the contract price plus restitution.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>§
2-712 and § 2-713 are alternatives. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Could Mother go for § 2-713? It would give her more money, because it goes
by market price rather than the price she paid to cover. It turns out, by the statute, that § 2-713 is
“completely alternative” to cover, and it can only apply if the buyer chooses <i>not</i>
to cover. So no, she couldn’t go for §
2-713 under these circumstances.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if she goes for unreasonable cover, e.g. too expensive? It’s not considered a cover. It doesn’t qualify to give her damages under
§ 2-712. She could actually proceed to §
2-713 if her cover is unreasonable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the cover is unreasonable, it’s not fair to shift the cost of that cover to the
contract breaker.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Problem
2: Say we’ve got the same contract and breach, but now Mother decides not to
buy the car anyhow. What are her
rights? We will proceed here to §
2-713. She should get market price minus
contract price plus restitution plus incidental and consequential damages.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Mother
had a favorable bargain here! The car
was worth $8200, and she was going to get the car for $7000. That’s worth something to Mother! Even if she didn’t want the car anymore, she
could have sold the car for $8200 and taken the $1200 profit.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Two
alternatives: market price minus contract price, where applicable, or cover
price minus contract price where applicable.</span></p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span>The injured party needs to
be put in the position performance would have done.</span></i></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is the backbone of all of the provisions of UCC Article 2.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
do we know what the market price is? In court,
Mother would have to prove what the market price of the car was. One bit of evidence that would be introduced
is the $7000 agreement. Mother must come
up with other evidence that this price was actually below market price and she
had a favorable deal going down.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
problem suggests that Mother gets a little more money if she doesn’t
cover. Realistically, she would have a
whole lot more trouble recovering damages if she didn’t cover because of the
proof she would have to supply showing market price.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
we settle a controversy, we really settle it. If a contract is not performed, we don’t know <i>precisely</i> what
position you would have been in if the contract had been performed. But we do the best we can. The historical record might show that you
made ought better or worse than you should have, but <i>too bad</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>An
aside, a Statute of Frauds question: what if the down payment had been a
penny? What about a nickel? What about one dollar? What if the agreement had been for a million
marbles and one marble was delivered? Is
there a valid agreement?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>§
1-106 in the “old” version of the UCC is equivalent to § 1-305 in the “new”
version of the UCC.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Problem
3: Byer agrees to buy Nabor’s Honda for $2500. Nabor delivers the car as scheduled, but Byer doesn’t pay as scheduled. What can Nabor get? Is this contract enforceable? Yes, because the goods were delivered (in the
other case, it was the money that had been paid).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
the remedy for the seller? Is it repossession
of the car? No. The car belongs to Byer. If Nabor goes and repossesses it, she’s a
tortfeasor and a thief.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
Nabor does have a contract claim for the full contract price. We find this out in § 2-709. This is the classic case of an “action for
the price”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
buyer’s got the goods. The credit period
has run. It’s common sense. And it’s provided for in the statute.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
Nabor can sue Byer for breach of contract and ought to collect $2500.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
also an action for the price if the seller can’t find somebody else who will
buy the goods at a reasonable price. Say
you have stationery with the buyer’s name on it. You’re not going to be able to sell that to
anybody else, so in that case you can sue the contract breaker for the price.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the buyer is found liable and does pay for the stuff, you have to give them the
stuff, with a few exceptions (c.f. false teeth cases). It’s rare that the seller needs the <i>full</i>
price.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Problem
4: say the seller doesn’t need the full price and won’t get it. Let’s say Byer was supposed to bring cash
when he picks up the car. He never picks
up the car and never pays. This contract
is not enforceable if it’s not written in this case. Nora resells the car to a third party for
$2000, which is $500 less than she would have received from Byer and $200 below
the market price of $2200. Can Nora
recover any damages from Byer?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Nora
certainly doesn’t need the <i>full price</i>. She kept the value of the car. Which section of the UCC will inform her of her rights? How about § 2-706? It involves the possibility of resale.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>§
2-706 provides for the recovery of the difference between the contract price
and the resale price. This suggests she
could get $500. This section is
analogous to § 2-712 for a buyer’s damages. § 2-706 mitigates a seller’s damages based on an <i>actual</i> resale,
where § 2-712 is based on reasonable cover.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Look
at § 2-706 (2): it says that <i>every aspect of the resale</i> must be
commercially reasonable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
is evidence that the resale was not reasonable because it was below market
price. Nabor has a $500 hole in her
pocket, but only $300 was caused by Byer. If she had been more careful in reselling the car, she would only have
been out that $300.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Where
do you go if § 2-706 doesn’t apply? You
go to § 2-708 (1) (seller’s damages for repudiation). § 2-706 (resale) is to § 2-712 (cover) as §
2-708 (1) <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>(seller’s damages for
repudiation) is to § 2-713 (buyer’s damages for repudiation).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
the resale is private, the seller must give the buyer reasonable
notification. No notification leads to
no resale damages.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the current problem, we must go to § 2-708 (1) and check out the current market
price. That $2200 price mentioned is
easy to state, but tough to prove. What
should we advise Nabor to do? She should
make sure to give notice of resale and take her time finding a good deal.</span></p>

<br/>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span>It’s hard to prove market
price. Cover or resale is better.</span></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Problem
5: Let’s say we have a car dealer with lots of cars to sell. Dealer agrees to sell a brand new Honda to
Byer for $14,500. Dealer has four
identical cars on her lot at the time. Byer signs a promise to pay $14,500. He changes his mind overnight. Two days later, Dealer sells the very same car to Sucker for $15,750. Also, we’re told that the Dealer paid $12,000
for the car and paid $2000 in overhead in doing her dealing.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Can
we recover the car? Nope, we still have
the car. § 2-709 will not help.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
about § 2-706? What if Dealer gave Byer
notice that she was going to resell? No
dice. The contract price minus the
resale price would be <i>negative</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>§
2-708 (1) is a loser too, because the market price minus the contract price is <i>negative</i>
too. Dealer gets nothing under any of
these sections.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
about Dealer tries § 2-708 (2)? She says
she needs a recovery to be placed in the same position performance would have
done. She’s in a different position than
Nabor. She has lost profits.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>However,
Dealer has several cars. In Nabor’s
case, it was a breach that made the second sale, or keeping the car,
possible. In Dealer’s case, she could
have made the sale to Sucker and anybody else. She has a much greater supply of cars than she can find buyers to
purchase them. She is a <i>lost-volume
seller</i>. Whatever that lost
transaction would have contributed to her is what she should recover.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Start
with the idea that the profit is the contract price minus the costs. So for starters, the profit is $2,500. If Byer had followed through, she would have
made this profit. If both Byer and
Sucker had bought cars, she would have received <i>both profits</i>. That’s why Dealer should recover the profit
from the contract Byer repudiated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Look
at Dealer like </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Luten</span></st1:PlaceName><span
> </span><st1:PlaceType><span
 >Bridge</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span> or any other services
contractor. Getting a second job doesn’t
mitigate a loss because an expansible service provider could have done <i>both
jobs</i>.</span></p>

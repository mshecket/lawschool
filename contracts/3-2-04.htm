          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">miserable</i> situation in many
          ways. Waters sold an annuity contract which was paying her about $2300
          a month for life and she sells it for $50,000, which is a terribly low
          price. It was guaranteed to pay out about $690,000 and it was worth
          $189,000. The solvent insurance company that the annuity was written
          on would have bought back the annuity for $189,000! The bastards paid
          $50,000 for the policy, which is a little over a quarter of what they
          can get by immediately, safely cashing in the annuity. On the terms
          here, this transaction makes
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">zero</i> economic sense and is
          rotten to the core.</span

          not to mention <span class="GramE">himself</span>. There is also undue

          transaction is made in an inappropriate place (the hood of a car).
          Waters was on drugs! If she was high at the time she made the deal,
          she has an incapacity claim to get out of this deal.</span

          whether unconscionability is really doing all that much work. If you
          represent someone like Waters, you want to have both a belt and
          suspenders and present your case on several different bases. Sometimes
          lawyers will be surprised by just what theory wins! The trial court
          might buy the theory that you thought was the weakest! Then, if the
          other side appeals, you might have to defend the weakest theory
          because it succeed at the trial court. So when you have strong
          theories, you don�t want to combine them with theories that are too
          weak to be believed. Also, don�t be too sure about what any particular
          judge or group of judges are going to buy. You usually want more than
          one shot.</span

          within 30 days. Among the terms included in the note, there�s an
          arbitration clause. Is that part of the deal? Yes. You don�t need to
          tell the customer beforehand about all these terms and conditions. You
          can tell the buyer of the terms when the buyer receives the goods and
          it will still count for Gateway

        <span

          provision. That would mean that Brower must arbitrate, rather than
          litigate, his claim that Gateway isn�t providing the service they
          promised. Also, they can�t maintain a class action against
          Gateway.</span

          ><st1:place><span>France</span></st1:place></st1:country-region
        ><span
          >. In order to participate in such arbitration, the customer would
          have to pay a $4,000 nonrefundable fee. That�s more than the computer
          cost! That�s outrageously high! This is

      <p>
        <span
          >As a remedy, the court will knock out the ICC arbitration provision
          primarily due to the outrageously high fee. The court has a lot of
          discretion as to what it can do in a situation where it finds
          unconscionability. The court could decide not to enforce the contract.
          That wouldn�t work in this case. Instead, the court seems to choose to
          enforce the rest of the contract except for the unconscionable clause.
          The court seems to either insert a reasonable arbitration clause, or
          the court limits application of the clause to eliminate the
          unconscionable result. Check out the second half of UCC � 2-302
          (1).</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The court sends the case back down to have an arbitrator selected by
          the court based on the Federal Arbitration Act. The trial court might
          appoint an arbitrator from the AAA or AAF, or the judge could appoint
          Joe <span class="SpellE">Dokes</span>, his friend who may or may not
          be a professional arbitrator. The court knocks out the
          unconscionability, and otherwise enforces the deal as it was made
          between the parties.</span

      <p>
        <span

          because Gateway has been piggish and has inserted an unconscionable
          arbitration provision, the customers will be allowed to litigate,
          including in a class action. This court is friendly to Gateway in that
          it cuts down the unconscionable arbitration provision to a
          conscionable arbitration provision. Because these determinations are
          made as a matter of law, they can be appealed vigorously.</span

          court won�t stand for it. But can Gateway do anything to justify this
          provision? The court is forced to hear from the allegedly
          �unconscionable� side and it must consider whether there�s another

          on. That would be time-consuming and troublesome! That�s the argument

          �this deal is subject to our standard terms and conditions that we�re

          >The <span class="SpellE">Howards</span> are tobacco farmers who buy
          an insurance policy against water damage from the Federal Crop
          Insurance Corporation. The <span class="SpellE">Howards</span> claim
          that their crop was damaged by rain and that they should recover
          $35,000. What�s the problem? They �disked� the tobacco stalks under
          the ground before the federal inspector had a chance to take a look at
          them. Because of that, the insurer doesn�t want to pay them. The trial
          court says that they don�t have to!</span

          >What did the trial court do with respect to plowing or disking the
          stalks under? One paragraph says that the tobacco stalks must not be
          plowed under before the insurance company can look at them. The trial
          court says that the condition precedent is that the stalks must not be
          destroyed before they are inspected. This condition triggers the
          promise of the insurer to pay the claim. If the condition is not met,
          the insured gets <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">nothing</i>.

          here, in the appellate court�s view, is a broken promise rather than a
          condition that wasn�t met. The appellate court finds that this is a
          promise <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">only </i>that is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> a condition. The

          What can the insurance company do? The promise to plow the stalks
          under has been broken. How can the insurance company turn that into
          damages? What would they have to prove to recover damages? They
          probably have a virtually
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">impossible</i> burden of proof
          here. They would have to prove that if the stalks hadn�t been plowed
          under that there would have been a case of fraud. But how can they
          prove what they could have shown if the world were different and the
          stalks hadn�t been plowed under? They can�t!</span

          thus finds the result in this case questionable. But you might argue
          that it�s fair that the risk and burden falls on the stronger party,
          which is the federal government.</span

          how a promise works. Sometimes a

          you want, but a promise won�t help. Sometimes a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">promise</i> will do the work
          you want, but a condition won�t help. Also notice that it�s rare for a
          provision to be found to be a

          relied on the promise. On the other hand, it seemed that the

          after the promise of the credit union than before that promise.

            >e. Gratuitous promises to procure insurance. This Section is to be
            applied with caution to promises to procure insurance. The
            appropriate remedy for breach of such a promise makes the promisor
            an insurer, and thus may result in a liability which is very large
            in relation to the value of the promised service. Often the promise
            is properly to be construed merely as a promise to use reasonable
            efforts to procure the insurance, and reliance by the promisee may
            be unjustified or may be justified only for a short time. Or it may
            be doubtful whether he did in fact rely. Such difficulties may be
            removed if the proof of the promise and the reliance are clear, or
            if the promise is made with some formality, or if part performance
            or a commercial setting or a potential benefit to the promisor

          this is that the franchise could have been cancelled at will by the

          <span class="GramE">do this</span>!� You do it, but the money doesn�t
          come through. A less sophisticated smaller party relies on
          instructions coming from a more sophisticated bigger part in a
          situation where this reliance seems reasonable, and denying recovery
          on the basis of that reliance seems unjust. But if there was no

          >The Second Restatement says that we can limit enforce �as justice
          requires�. Under the Second Restatement, Johnny can recover at most
          $500. Justice would not require giving him $500. In many courts,
          Johnny can�t even get the $500. He would get the difference between
          the $500 and what he could get if he sold the car. Many courts will
          say that all that is necessary to do justice here is to save Johnny
          from out-of-pocket cost. Justice does <i>not</i> demand that we put
          Johnny in the driver�s seat.</span

          >Why might we choose to fully enforce a promise on the basis of
          reliance? It might be easier to enforce the promise as made. It might
          be hard to value the reliance, and one way to get out of it is to
          provide full enforcement. However, there will be a good number of
          cases where the court can ascertain how much the reliance was worth,
          and less this amount, we�ll let the promisor change their mind.</span

        <span
          >This is a gratuitous promise, but it�s a different gratuitous promise
          than made in the case of Johnny and his uncle. Fried is a landlord and
          Fisher and Brill are tenants. Fisher decided to get out of the florist
          business and open a restaurant. He asked Fried to let him out of the
          lease. Fried promised not to hassle Fisher anymore on the rent. Fried
          got no consideration for this promise, but this promise is enforced on
          the basis of reliance. We know that there was reliance here because
          shortly after the promise was made, Fisher quit the florist business
          and opened a restaurant, at least partially in reliance of the promise
          made by Fried. In fact, Fisher�s restaurant was quite
          successful.</span

          record, but that probably wouldn�t have made a different. It would
          have been very hard to calculate how much the reliance was worth.
          Also, even though the restaurant turned out well, Fisher took a big
          risk in reliance. When you take a big risk in reliance, courts have
          held that this is enough to grant full enforcement.</span

          not consideration and will not support a return promise. This has a

          you. Let�s say I give you $700 and we�ll call it quits.� The creditor
          says, �Okay.� The debtor pays $700, and the creditor sues for the
          remaining $300. Courts will not hold the creditor to his promise
          because there was no consideration. The creditor got nothing more than
          he was already owed. The �pre-existing duty� rule says there is no
          exchange. Check out � 73 of the Restatement.</span

        <b><span style="font-size: 14pt">Facts:</span></b
        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          The defendant, a linoleum seller, made a mistake as to how much
          linoleum was needed to build a new public building: they thought only
          half as much was needed as actually was required. The defendant send
          out offers to a bunch of contractors to supply all the linoleum
          necessary to build the new building, but the offer price was basically
          half of what it should have been. One plaintiff, having received the
          offer, put in a bid to build the state building based on that offer.
          The defendant telegraphed all the contractors to let them know of the
          mistake. But the state had already accepted the offer, and the
          plaintiff sent the defendant an acceptance. The defendant denied that
          a contract had been made, and in a suit for breach of contract by the
          plaintiff, the trial court found for the defendant. The plaintiff
          appealed, saying, in essence, that it was understood that the
          contractors would be making bids in reliance on the defendant�s offer
          to supply linoleum.</span

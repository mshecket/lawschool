<p><b><span>A
variation on <i><a href="rockinghamcountyvlutenbridgeco.html">Rockingham</a></i></span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
bridge company’s agreement with </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
 >Rockingham</span></st1:PlaceName><span
> </span><st1:PlaceType><span
 >County</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span> is breached, but then they
go to another county and start building another bridge. Does this affect their ability to collect damages
on the breach?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Compare
to <i><a href="parkervtwentiethcenturyfoxfilmcorp.html">Parker</a></i>. Shirley MacLaine is not <i>expansive</i>. She can only do one thing at a time. The bridge company can probably build one,
two, or ten bridges at the same time. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Its limitation on how many bridges it can
build is probably how much work it can get.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
if Luten could have performed its contract with </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
 >Rockingham</span></st1:PlaceName><span
> </span><st1:PlaceType><span
 >County</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span> and </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
 >Bunkum</span></st1:PlaceName><span
> </span><st1:PlaceType><span
 >County</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span> at the same time, its gain
from dealing with </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Bunkum</span></st1:PlaceName><span
> </span><st1:PlaceType><span
 >County</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span> doesn’t matter to its loss.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the other hand, if Shirley MacLaine goes and makes another movie during that 14
weeks in question, the earnings from that movie mitigate her losses from the breach
of contract over “Bloomer Girl”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
you’re a solo-practioning lawyer. If you
have lots of time and not many clients, it’s unlikely that picking up another
client and making money off them will mitigate damages from another client who
breaches their contract with you. If, on
the other hand, you get really busy, getting another client could mitigate.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
you have a contract with X, and X repudiates his promise, and you tell X that
you’re going to sue. Now say that X
wants to offer you another deal. Is it
your duty to take the offer? Is X an
untrustworthy contract-breaker? Sometimes you can clearly ignore the second offer from the contract-breaker.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The
Practice Exam Question</span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
party aggrieved by a breach has a duty to mitigate damages that can be
recovered without undue trouble. Jobs
available to you do not mitigate unless they are comparable. One way courts look at it is: if a job is
either different or inferior <i>in kind</i> to the contract job, you don’t have
to take it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
lot of jobs are going to mitigate in these circumstances. Is </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >UK</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> different enough to say
that it’s different in kind or inferior in kind? Who decides this? It is decided by a jury.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the other hand, you don’t need a jury to tell you that driving an 18-wheeler is
inferior to working for a law firm. You
could get that on summary judgment.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
would you argue Graduate’s case to a jury? How is a jury going to react to your client? How would a jury react to Shirley MacLaine
who wants $750,000 for sitting around?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Graduate
asks the jury to pay her $110,000 or a significant part of that when she could
have mitigated the damages to a great degree. How sympathetic will the jury be to her?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
difference in pay between the two jobs is not a factor that makes it inferior
in kind because she can recover the difference between the two salaries. If the salary difference was a lot bigger,
that fact might be seen as evidence that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >UK</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> is inferior in kind.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are some superior aspects to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >UK</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. For example, a higher percentage of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >UK</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>’s lawyers are partners. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >UK</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> also has jobs available,
whereas DCH is losing clients and laying off attorneys.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a jury question. You need to think
about arguments you would make to a jury.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Big
deal: DCH offered a one year contract, and it never said that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >UK</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> was offering the same. That’s something that could be superior with
DCH. <i>Tricky tricky! </i>If nothing else, it’s probably different.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
question we’re discussing usually doesn’t arise with most employees and most
employers.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
if the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>UK</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> job doesn’t mitigate, what
does she get? She gets $70,000.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Was
the law clerk job different in kind? Yes,
because it’s a temporary job. The law
firm job is, in all likelihood, a lifetime job. That doesn’t matter, because a job taken mitigates.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
the broken contract was for full-time employment, anything you do for money
during the contract’s time period will mitigate your damages.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
order for Graduate to only receive nominal damages, you would have to show that
there were other firms in the same place at the same time that weren’t inferior
or different in kind that would have paid her $110,000 or more.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>DCH
might go around to its competitor firms and ask: “Would you have hired this
person at the time we repudiated?” This
would go toward proving that Graduate didn’t do a decent job search.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
know that Graduate can recover no more than $70,000.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the plaintiff rejects a comparable job, that’s her right, but she gives up the
loss of wages she could have mitigated.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Problem</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if the employee breaks the employment contract? The speech therapist breaches her promise to work for the school
district. What will it cost to reasonably
replace this employee? How replaceable
are you?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
this problem, the school district had to be replaced with someone who had more
teaching experience who they therefore had to pay more. It turns out that the speech therapist owes
the school district the $3,000 difference. The school district didn’t want a more experienced person. That’s not a benefit to them.</span></p>

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">infancy</i> or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">minority</i>. Lemke sold a used
          car to Halbman for $1,250. Halbman has paid $1,100. Then something
          broke. The repair shop took the engine out of the car on a garageman�s
          lien. Then the car got towed back to Halbman�s, and it got vandalized.
          All that is left is the wreck of a car. Halbman succeeds in getting
          off the hook. How come?</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The doctrine of infancy is intended to keep kids from getting taken
          advantage of by adults. But did Halbman really get screwed in this
          deal? Did he not know what he was doing? How could Lemke have known
          that Halbman was a minor? Should it make a difference if he
          knew?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The standard answer is that this is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">per se</i> rule. It doesn�t
          matter if you�re a �crafty� adult. It doesn�t matter whether or not
          you know that the person you�re dealing with is a minor. It doesn�t
          matter if it was really a bad deal. What we�re doing is protecting the
          immature from the consequences of their own immaturity. Could Halbman
          have enforced the contract? Sure. This doctrine of infancy makes the
          minor�s promise <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">voidable</i>.
          The minor can enforce the return promise from the adult if that�s
          advantageous. The minor can walk away from the contract if that�s
          advantageous.</span

          >Other things to notice about this doctrine: It is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">extremely</i> arbitrary. Notice
          how mental incompetence is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> arbitrary and is
          specifically tailored to the individual human being involved. With
          minors, you are immature until the day before your 18<sup>th</sup>
          birthday. Until then, you�re immature and can only make voidable
          contracts. After that, you�re an adult and competent to contract,
          period. But aren�t some 49 year olds immature? Aren�t some 15 year
          olds mature? There are benefits as well as costs, though. The benefit
          is that this is easy to administer. It�s not hard to find out when
          someone was born and how old they are. When we get to mental
          incompetence, we�ll find that it�s extremely difficult to figure out
          whether someone is competent or not.</span

      <p>
        <span

      <p>
        <span
          >One of the exceptions to this doctrine in most places is
          misrepresentation of age by the minor. That�s a tort. Minors can
          commit crimes and torts and be treated as adults sometimes. In
          Contracts, that�s not done. You�re a minor or an adult and that�s the
          end of it with few qualifications (you must
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">actively</i> misrepresent your
          age). But if you lie and say you�re an adult when you�re not and the
          lie is deceiving, that is, the adult on the other side is conned by
          it, that can take away or qualify your right to disaffirm your
          contract.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The minor is incompetent to contract. How can the minor disaffirm?
          The parent or guardian can do it for him, or the minor can wait until
          adulthood and then disaffirm. However, if the minor waits too long, he
          may be found to have ratified the contract and it may be too late to
          disaffirm.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If you understand the law, you will be unwilling to deal with minors
          when the stakes are high.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is also the doctrine of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">necessities</i>. If you supply
          something that is necessary to the minor, you may be able to enforce a
          contract against that minor depending on how you define �necessity�.
          Is a car a necessity for a minor? Most courts say no. What about food?
          Food may not be a necessity if the minor is not emancipated and is
          being provided food by his or her parents. When you get right down to
          it, this doctrine doesn�t cover a whole lot. It may cover emancipated
          minors, such as those who are married.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Notice that this infancy doctrine, while rooted in basic common sense
          and fairness, creates a lot of inconveniences and may go too far in a
          number of circumstances. One significant reform has been lowering the
          age of majority from 21 to 18. This has now taken place in all 50
          states. The age was lowered for voting purposes first, and then came
          down in other areas.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Not every state follows the approach in this case. Some states
          wouldn�t let Halbman avoid the contract unless he made full
          restitution to Lemke (if he was a good guy who didn�t defraud or
          oppress Halbman). Is that good policy? The </span
        ><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt">Wisconsin</span></st1:place
        ><span>
          court represents the majority approach, and says that we�ll protect
          minors from their own immaturity. That immaturity takes more than one
          form: (1) the minor was immature to get into this deal, and (2) the
          minor was immature when he wrecked the car. We�ll let him off the hook
          for both kinds of immaturity.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the �sword/shield� deal? It�s easier to avoid a contract
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">defensively</i>. If an adult
          sues you to enforce it against you, it�s easier to get out. That would
          be true if Lemke sued Halbman for the unpaid $150. In jurisdictions
          that go the other way, one thing the adult can do to protect himself
          is to insist on cash when dealing with a minor. If you get cash, the
          minor must come at you with the �sword� rather than the �shield�, and
          it maybe harder for the minor to get relief.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The doctrine is mind-boggling with respect to a lot of services
          transactions. When a minor buys a car, the minor has it and there�s
          some chance of restitution. But when a minor buys services, the
          services are consumed and there is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">no chance</i> to make
          restitution. If you consume a service as a minor, you can disaffirm,
          get your money back, and you have nothing in your hands that you have
          to give back.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >There is a lot of stuff marketed towards minors. So, for example, it
          would seem that a kid could buy a movie ticket or a pizza, disaffirm,
          and get their money back. Does that make any sense? Maybe we can claim
          that the amounts involved are so small that no one cares.</span

          other policy is to protect people who can�t protect themselves. We

          Mr. and Mrs. Ortelere. The court can be kind-hearted to Ortelere�s
          husband and get away with it at little cost to the other side. On the
          other hand, if Mrs. Ortelere bought tickets to a concert and promised
          to pay for them in the future. If the impresario putting on the
          concert loses revenue from those tickets, he may be able to recover.

          failing mental health. The handyman who cons Farum into selling her

          Say an old person has two children but all of the sudden decides to
          give everything to one. It could be a result of incompetence, or it
          could be the result of undue influence on the part of a child.</span

          to make a contract. If you�re very old and aren�t very much in your
          right mind, yet desperately needs to make a will, then we may be more
          likely to enforce the will if the will is fair on its face. Courts
          will have a lower standard for deciding whether the person is
          competent to write a will than to write a contract.</span

          farm from an old person (Oliver Oldfellow). Your client wants to make
          a deal that can be relied upon. The old person doesn�t seem very
          competent to your client. He�s pretty out of it. But on the other
          hand, your client says that he plays poker well, has made good stock
          market investments, and generally has good days and bad days. How
          could Dorothy make a successful deal with this guy? A lot of the
          world�s wealth is held by people who are quite old and aren�t really
          with it, so this is an important practical problem.</span

          Oldfellow appropriate counsel, like a real estate agent and an
          attorney. You need a competent attorney who isn�t too closely
          connected to you. But you also don�t want to hook him up with a

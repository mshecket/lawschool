<p><b><span lang=FR style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p><span>Often
when parties make a contract they agree to arbitration in the case of a
dispute. What motivates parties to agree
to arbitration?</span></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>The
vast majority of arbitrators are lawyers who are not experts on anything but
the law. When a lawyer is an arbitrator,
they settle the controversy so people can get along with their lives. Lay people have a lot of trouble with this.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
you agree to arbitration, you rarely know who the arbitrator is going to be. The arbitrator is picked randomly. You have no clue whether the arbitrator is
going to have expertise or not.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
what are the big reasons for arbitration? It’s faster and cheaper. In a
pinch, you can get arbitrators’ decisions sometimes in three or four days, and
usually less than six months.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
you have an arbitrator, there is no jury. You don’t have to spend money to persuade lay people, which may be
difficult. You’re persuading someone
with law training.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Perhaps
the biggest factor is that there is no possibility for appeal. This can be both an advantage and a
disadvantage, but the advantage is that once the matter is settled, it’s <i>really
settled</i>. Appeals, on the other hand,
take time and money.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Arbitration
offers a trade-off: you get less due process, but you get it over with much
cheaper and faster.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you are a repeat litigator, arbitration may leave you much better off after
twelve disputes even if some of them don’t go your way or aren’t fair.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Arbitrators
are private citizens. They can make an
award, but they have no way to enforce any judgment. If the losing party doesn’t comply with the arbitrator’s
award, they have to go to court to get the award enforced. Courts are the basis for enforcing awards. This leads to a conflict.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Courts
aren’t supposed to <i>review</i> the arbitrator’s award, but they must enforce
them. Sometimes, the court is going to
say that they <i>cannot</i> enforce the award because it goes against some
strong policy. The judge has a
conscience!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
say the arbitrator forces an employee to go back to work. Will the court enforce this? It will probably not, because this goes
against a strong presumption against involuntary servitude. Sometimes, the judge is called upon to enforce
an award that is found to be unconscionable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the arbitrator does something that no court would have done, yet the court is
called upon by statute to enforce the order, what should the court do?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you’re a good arbitrator, will you only issue awards that courts will
enforce? Sure, but you don’t have to
follow the law. Some arbitration
agreements provide that the arbitrator must follow the law of a certain jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>99%
of the time, enforcement of the arbitration award is “like rolling off a log”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Arbitration
agreements are a way to “bargain out of the law”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Modern
arbitration statutes will quickly stop a suit that flies in the face of a
previously agreed to arbitration clause.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Many,
if not most arbitration awards are voluntarily complied with.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p><span>This
case started out in arbitration, and an order was made that the courts
themselves would not and could not have made as a matter of law.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
did we do remedies first? Clients want
to know: “What can this guy to do me? What I can do to this guy? What
good is this agreement going to do me? <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>What <i>harm</i> is this agreement going to do
me? Do we really want to do this? If we do, <i>how</i> do we want to do it?”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>What
promises ought to be enforced?</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Chapter
2 is about what promises ought to be enforced. Chapter 3 is about finding out whether a contract has really been
created.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Imagine
if the sanction for breach of contract was capital punishment. In this case, people wouldn’t make contracts,
and courts would be very reluctant to enforce them. On the other hand, if the cost of breaching a
contract was $5, people would make contracts all the time because they would be
cheap.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span><a
href="ch2introductorynote.htm">Karl Llewellyn</a> says that once upon a time,
the enforcement of promises was rare, but now, the enforcement of promises is
usual. We will enforce <i>almost all</i>
promises.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span><a
href="cohenthebasisofcontract.htm">Cohen</a> says that sometimes it’s good to
have someone change their mind about performing a contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
will not enforce any promises <i>unless</i> there is a “doctrinal peg on which
we can hang our hat” that says “this is an enforceable promise”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="congregationkadimahtoras-moshevdeleo.htm">Congregation Kadimah
Toras-Moshe v. DeLeo</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court found that DeLeo’s promise to give money to the congregation was unenforceable. It was found that there is no <i>legally
acceptable reason</i> to enforce the promise. His estate can “change his mind” on his behalf.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
there doubt that the promise was made? No, he made the promise four or five times in the presence of
witnesses. There is <i>no</i> doubt that
he made this promise. There is also no
doubt that he <i>broke </i>his promise.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Reasons
to enforce promises: Consideration</span></b></p>

<br/>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span dir=LTR><span>This is an idea that is so simple that it is

</span></span></span><![endif]><span dir=LTR><span>If nothing is traded or exchanged for the promise,

tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><![endif]><span dir=LTR><span>We used to talk about this a different way: “Benefit
to the promisor or detriment to the promisee would make a promise enforceable.” This is 82% right, and the drafters of the
Restatement have changed it.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Sometimes,
a contract consists of a promise in exchange for something else other than a
promise. More often, a contract is “a
promise for a promise”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
congregation claimed that it promised to name a library after DeLeo. If DeLeo had been seeking to have that
library named after him and gave the $25,000 for that, there would be
consideration.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Reasons
to enforce promises: Reliance and Restatement § 90</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>§
90 is the most famous and important section in the whole Restatement. It applies to contracts <i>without</i>
consideration. § 90 will make a promise enforceable
if it induces some action on the part of the promisee such that it would be
unjust not to enforce it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the above case, the congregation did not rely on DeLeo’s promise.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Reasons
to enforce promises: Charitable subscriptions</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>When
you promise to give money to charity, you may be bound simply on the fact that
the promisee is a charity.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
didn’t what DeLeo did constitute a charitable subscription? He did not write down his pledge.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
if you <i>write down</i> a pledge to give money to charity even if there is no consideration,
it may be enforceable as a charitable subscription.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
should we enforce charitable subscriptions? This is a controversial idea. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and almost everywhere else,
we want to see a formality before we enforce a charitable subscription.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
opinion also rules that to enforce this opinion would be against public
policy. What the heck was the court
talking about? This was not only oral,
but it was also a <i>deathbed promise</i>. Was it coaxed from the dying person? Was this an extravagant gesture? Does the widow need the money? These are considerations that come up in cases of charitable
subscriptions.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
have lots of policies <i>in favor</i> of charities, but there are also some
reasons we may want to have second thoughts about these promises.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Reasons
to enforce promises: Formality</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
DeLeo made a promise <i>under seal</i> in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, it would have been enforceable. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, on the other hand, has
abolished the seal.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>What
is the seal?</span></i><span></span></p>

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Brunson played the organ. Pingley hired him to play three nights a
          week for three years. Brunson repudiated. Pingley sued for specific
          performance and an injunction against Brunson playing organ for anyone
          else. Brunson appealed.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Can a court order specific performance in a personal service
          contract?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Courts cannot order specific performance for personal service
          contracts unless the performer has some unique ability.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court found that there were adequate substitute organ players in
          the area, and thus Brunson was not unique.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>The court also found that
          there was no negative covenant in the contract saying that Brunson
          mustn�t play organ for anyone else.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The court overturned the trial court�s ruling.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <u><span>Question</span></u

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >I don�t see how Pingley could have a case against the other
          restaurants since he never contracted with any of those restaurants.
          The duty to not work for anyone else would lie with Brunson, not with
          the other restaurants.</span

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          McDonald worked for Mobil. He got fired, or was supposedly forced to
          resign, due to rumors of sexual harassment. McDonald sued Mobil,
          claiming that his employee handbook constituted a contract and that
          Mobil was in breach. The trial court granted summary judgment to
          Mobil, and McDonald appealed. The Wyoming Supreme Court reversed and
          remanded to see if promissory estoppel applied to the situation. Then
          Mobil made a motion for rehearing and that�s how the case came before
          the court this time.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the employee handbook, along with the course of conduct between
          Mobil and McDonald modify the at-will nature of McDonald�s
          employment?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Disclaimers must be conspicuous in order to be effective against
          employees.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court looks at the disclaimers that McDonald got, and finds that
          they are inadequate to prevent confusion. The handbook itself didn�t
          say that it wasn�t binding on the employer, and a reasonable person
          could get confused and think that it was. The disclaimers are held to
          not be binding on McDonald.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Then the court talks about the objective versus subjective
          interpretation issue. It doesn�t matter if Mobil didn�t subjectively
          intent to make a contract with McDonald if a reasonable person in
          McDonald�s shoes would think that Mobil did make a contract. So the
          court has to decide whether there�s any possibility that a reasonable
          person could think such a thing. If there is, then the question should
          be allowed to go to a jury.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court finds that McDonald was led to believe that Mobil would be
          bound by its own employee handbook procedures in dealing with the
          harassment allegations. Instead, Mobil thought it had retained the
          right to fire McDonald at any time for any reason.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is a concurring opinion and two dissents. The concurring
          opinion says the court should say as a matter of law that Mobil�s
          employee handbook constituted a legally binding promise from Mobil to
          McDonald and that the only issue for the trial court should be Mobil
          should have been forbidden from firing McDonald without cause.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One dissent says that there�s nothing more that Mobil could have done
          to make the employee know that they didn�t intend to enter an
          employment contract. This dissent says that the court�s decision could
          conceivably outlaw at-will employment, and that this is bad from a
          policy standpoint.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The other dissent says that in the previous hearing of the case, the
          issue was whether promissory estoppel could apply, but now the issue
          is whether the employee handbook is a binding contract. This dissent
          says that there is no contract. I think this dissent kind of rejects
          Restatement � 90 for some reason. Well, actually � 90 doesn�t use the
          word �contract�. I guess what this dissent is saying is that the
          majority is getting mixed up between the meaning of �contract� and the
          meaning of �promise�.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court reverses summary judgment and remands to find out whether
          the at-will employment of McDonald got modified.</span

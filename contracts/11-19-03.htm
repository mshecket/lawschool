          they give her the acceptance she�s seeking? Not the whole acceptance
          in some respects. First off, they don�t complete their performance:
          the dispute arose while Sarah was still alive. They started rendering
          performance, but they haven�t completed it at the time of this case.
          Second, she contends that their performance was half-baked and
          unpleasant and that therefore they aren�t holding up their end of the
          bargain. Sarah decides to repudiate her offer.</span

          revoked while the offeree is working on getting it done. This is what
          is done in the present case. This is contrary to the position taken by
          Wormser in 1916.</span

          silly hypothetical, you may well come out with a silly answer.
          Crossing a bridge is no big deal. But the performance done by the
          Brackenburys <i>is</i> significant. It makes sense as a matter of
          fairness that the court should give them specific performance.</span

          protect their expectation interest, though it would be tricky to find
          out just how much that would be. Equity probably provided a better
          avenue of relief for the Brackenburys.</span

          who would evict them. The court comes in and gives preliminary relief
          that will keep Walter from doing that. That means that if the
          Brackenburys continue to perform and fully �pay the price�, they�ll
          get the stuff they were promised. They�ll have to keep taking care of
          Sarah as long as she�s alive. If and when they fully perform, they�ll
          get their deal.</span

          >, we would not force obnoxious personal contact. That seems to be the
          case here. After the decree, Brackenbury really did misbehave. He was
          not a nice guy. How much do you fault the court for the obnoxious
          association that resulted from this decree?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What could we say in the court�s favor? The court would say: �What we
          did is make an equitable order or decree, maintaining jurisdiction.
          What we were telling the parties is that they should behave themselves
          and try to make it work. The Brackenburys deserve a chance to earn
          their way to their expectancy. If it doesn�t work out, Hodgkin can
          come back to try to work something else out.� Hodgkin never did come
          back to tell the court it wasn�t working. If they really couldn�t get
          along, the court might have tried something else. Today, maybe the
          court would have Hodgkin put into a retirement home at the
          Brackenbury�s expense.</span

          interest. A remedy at common law would be severe on Sarah because it
          would probably leave her homeless. Courts will scramble around to find
          a just solution. A lot of cases aren�t thought through very carefully
          at the outset. If the parties had a thoughtful advisor, they might
          have been told that there was no way they were going to get

          option contracts, offers to sell that are irrevocable, from the owners
          of the various tracts of land you want to cobble together. If you can
          get offers from all the owners, then you can accept the whole

          the conscience� of a court of equity for a party to convey a $350,000

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The plaintiff and defendant made a one-year employment contract. The
          plaintiff stopped working after 9.5 months. The jury awarded him $95
          out of the full $120. The defendant appealed on the basis that the
          plaintiff should get nothing because the work had been done under a
          so-called �special contract�.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> May the breaching party recover for services rendered?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          NEW RULE! A hired laborer is entitled to compensation for work
          actually performed unless there is an express stipulation to the
          contrary in the contract.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court makes an analogy between labor contracts and contracts to
          build houses. When you build only part of a house and then breach, you
          are entitled to restitution damages for the value you conferred upon
          the other party. The old rule was that if you voluntarily failed to
          fulfill an employment contract, you were not entitled to recover
          anything for the work you had done. The court feels that even though
          precedent says differently, the better rule is the one above.</span

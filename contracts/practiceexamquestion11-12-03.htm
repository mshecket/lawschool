<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>I
would advise Jill that she is not obligated to return the car to Uncle George
because delivering the title to the car to her constituted a completed gift.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Question
2:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>I
would advise her that she may be able to recover the uninsured loss depending
on when Uncle George stopped paying the premiums.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not clear from the facts that Uncle
George ever paid the insurance premiums, either because he forgot or he broke
his promise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Jill
may be able to recover on a promissory estoppel theory.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Uncle George’s promise to pay her insurance
premiums induced her reasonable reliance on those premiums being paid.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If she knew they weren’t being paid, she
might have chosen to keep the car in the Bates garage all the time or sell it
instead of risking theft or damage by driving it around.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Uncle George should have reasonably expected
that his promise to pay for insurance would induce Jill to not pay for
insurance herself while continuing to drive the car.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jill actually did not buy insurance herself,
and kept driving the car, and it is likely that she would have acted
differently in the absence of Uncle George’s promise.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Uncle George’s promise may be enforced even
though it was not bargained for, nor was it met with consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>However,
this remedy is limited.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jill will only
be given relief if it is necessary to prevent injustice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Jill had reason to know that Uncle George
was going to get angry and stop paying for her insurance before she actually
received the letter, she should have changed her behavior in order to reduce
the risk of an uninsured loss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>On
the other hand, Uncle George’s promise in its entirety seems like a gift
promise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A majority of courts would enforce
a gift promise on the basis of promissory estoppel, but courts are generally
less likely to enforce such promises between family members.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Maybe
Jill was the cheapest cost avoider: if Uncle George simply forgot to pay the
premiums, Jill should have checked to make sure they were up to date.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A court may find that justice does not
require that Jill be compensated because she should have checked that she was
insured rather than taking Uncle George’s word for it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, Uncle George should have
told Jill before he stopped making the insurance payments so that she could
adjust her behavior accordingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Question
3:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Finally,
I would advise Jill that she will not be able to enforce Uncle George’s
promises to garage, maintain, fuel, and insure the car in the future because
there was no consideration for Uncle George’s promise.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The $10 and the lock of hair were not
bargained for, that is why they are not real consideration.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Uncle George clearly didn’t want the $10 or
the lock of hair, and thought they were a joke.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The value of the $10 is clearly out of proportion to the value of the
car as stated in the letter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even though
adequacy of consideration doesn’t matter, the $10 being so far out of
proportion to the $100,000 value of the car is good evidence that the $10 was
not real consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>On
the other hand, the lock of hair does not have a particular monetary value that
any court could definitively attach.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore,
Uncle George did finally accept both items knowing the possible legal
significance of doing so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

      <br />

      <p><span>Question 1:</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >I would advise Jill that she is not obligated to return the car to
          Uncle George because delivering the title to the car to her
          constituted a completed gift.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p><span>Question 2:</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >I would advise her that she may be able to recover the uninsured loss
          depending on when Uncle George stopped paying the premiums. It�s not
          clear from the facts that Uncle George ever paid the insurance
          premiums, either because he forgot or he broke his promise.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Jill may be able to recover on a promissory estoppel theory. Uncle
          George�s promise to pay her insurance premiums induced her reasonable
          reliance on those premiums being paid. If she knew they weren�t being
          paid, she might have chosen to keep the car in the Bates garage all
          the time or sell it instead of risking theft or damage by driving it
          around. Uncle George should have reasonably expected that his promise
          to pay for insurance would induce Jill to not pay for insurance
          herself while continuing to drive the car. Jill actually did not buy
          insurance herself, and kept driving the car, and it is likely that she
          would have acted differently in the absence of Uncle George�s promise.
          Uncle George�s promise may be enforced even though it was not
          bargained for, nor was it met with consideration.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >However, this remedy is limited. Jill will only be given relief if it
          is necessary to prevent injustice. If Jill had reason to know that
          Uncle George was going to get angry and stop paying for her insurance
          before she actually received the letter, she should have changed her
          behavior in order to reduce the risk of an uninsured loss.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >On the other hand, Uncle George�s promise in its entirety seems like
          a gift promise. A majority of courts would enforce a gift promise on
          the basis of promissory estoppel, but courts are generally less likely
          to enforce such promises between family members.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Maybe Jill was the cheapest cost avoider: if Uncle George simply
          forgot to pay the premiums, Jill should have checked to make sure they
          were up to date. A court may find that justice does not require that
          Jill be compensated because she should have checked that she was
          insured rather than taking Uncle George�s word for it. On the other
          hand, Uncle George should have told Jill before he stopped making the
          insurance payments so that she could adjust her behavior
          accordingly.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p><span>Question 3:</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Finally, I would advise Jill that she will not be able to enforce
          Uncle George�s promises to garage, maintain, fuel, and insure the car
          in the future because there was no consideration for Uncle George�s
          promise. The $10 and the lock of hair were not bargained for, that is
          why they are not real consideration. Uncle George clearly didn�t want
          the $10 or the lock of hair, and thought they were a joke. The value
          of the $10 is clearly out of proportion to the value of the car as
          stated in the letter. Even though adequacy of consideration doesn�t
          matter, the $10 being so far out of proportion to the $100,000 value
          of the car is good evidence that the $10 was not real
          consideration.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >On the other hand, the lock of hair does not have a particular
          monetary value that any court could definitively attach. Furthermore,
          Uncle George did finally accept both items knowing the possible legal
          significance of doing so.</span

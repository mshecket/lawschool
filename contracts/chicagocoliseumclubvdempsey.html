<p><span>Appellate
Court of Illinois, First District, 1932.</span></p>

<p><span>265
Ill.App. 542.</span></p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The plaintiff and defendant
made a contract to put on a boxing match. The defendant repudiated, having made a contract to fight someone else
at the same time. The plaintiff sued for
an injunction in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Indiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to keep him from training
or taking part in the fight. The plaintiff
subsequently sued in Cook County, Illinois for various damages, including damages
from loss of profits, expenses incurred prior to the contract signing, the
costs of the action in Indiana, and expenses incurred between the signing of
the contract and the date of the breach.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> To which damages is the plaintiff
entitled?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> When expectation damages
are improper or insufficient, reliance and restitution damages may be
substituted in certain cases.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court advocates a
reliance measure of damages for the plaintiff, arguing that lost profits are
too uncertain, expenses incurred before the signing of the contract were
speculative, and the costs of the attempted injunction against Dempsey were
incurred at the plaintiff’s own risk.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The court reversed and
remanded the ruling of the trial court and ordered a new trial.</span></p>

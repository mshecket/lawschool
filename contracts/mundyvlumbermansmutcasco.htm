        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The plaintiff had an insurance policy covering burglary. They were
          sent a notice that the policy was changing such that the insurance
          company�s liability for stolen silver would be limited to $1,000 in
          the future. They didn�t really look at the notice. Later, there was a
          burglary and lots of silver was stolen from them. The insurance
          company refused to pay out more than $1,000. The Mundys sued, claiming
          that they weren�t given adequate notice of the change in their
          policy.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> Is the policy change binding on the Mundys?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          An insured person is bound by the terms of a renewal policy as long as
          the person actually receives the policy.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that the notice given in the policy itself was quite
          clear. Holding the Mundys to its contents goes along with the common
          law �duty to read�.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</span>

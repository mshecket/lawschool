<p><span>Death
revokes an offer, even without notice. There can be no subjective mutual assent when one of the parties
dies. However, the death can be highly
disruptive to the offeree’s affairs. Restatement § 48 describes this rule as a “relic” which doesn’t make
much sense in the context of objective mutual assent. But why does this rule persist? What can be said for this rule?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
thing is that offers are revocable unless there’s something to change
that. While alive, the offerer can
revoke the offer. Once the offeror is
dead, it’s too late for the offeror to revoke because he’s dead. When you’re dead, your executor can act for
you and presumably revoke your offers. However, an executor may not know about all the offers you’ve made. If the executor could find out what offers
you’ve made, one of the first things he would do is go around and “revoke up a
storm”. These considerations support the
rule. The rule has its good points and
bad points.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="davisvjacoby.htm">Davis v. Jacoby</a></span></i></b></p>

<p><span><br>
Caro Davis was Mrs. Whitehead’s niece. The Whiteheads had raised her like a daughter. When she grew up, she moved to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Canada</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> with her husband. As the Whiteheads got older, their health
declined. It’s the Depression and bad
stuff is going on. Mr. Whitehead’s fortunes
are taking a turn for the worst. Whitehead
communicates with the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> by mail. Note that before we had modern technology,
the mail worked a lot better than it does today (according to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Mr.
Whitehead writes to the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> and makes the “definite
offer”: if the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> will come to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, Caro will inherit
everything. The court interprets this as
a promise to make a will in Caro Davis’s favor. Mr. Whitehead also says, “Will you let me hear from you ASAP?”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Mr.
Davis answers the letter on the 14<sup>th</sup> and says that they are coming
to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Mr.
Whitehead dies. The </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> take care of Mrs. Whitehead
until she dies. Then they <span
class=GramE>say,</span> where is our money? They get the bad news that Mr. Whitehead had made a will in favor of two
nephews and left everything to them. Under
those circumstances, the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> file suit against the
nephews, seeking specific performance.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
specific performance here? Why would the
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s lawyer seek that instead of money damages? Why is specific performance available in this
case? Specific performance is available
here because specific performance comes out automatically when a contract for
the sale of land is at issue. The
nephews aren’t in breach of a promise, which makes it hard to get damages from
them.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> had equitable title to the land, and they’re
protecting that title by specific performance. Another reason they do specific performance is that it gives them the “whole
shebang”. Damages would open the
possibility that the court might split the difference and do something for the
nephews. Those are a few reasons why specific
performance was sought.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Note
that if the nephews had been bona fide purchasers, it would have all been
over. The nephews don’t qualify as bona
fide purchasers because they gave no value. They’re donees.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> failed to establish a contract before the trial
court. They find them to be losers. How does the trial court analyze the
situation? The trial court found that
the offer of Mr. Whitehead was an offer that could only be accepted by performance. It’s an offer to enter into a <i>unilateral</i>
contract, in the view of the trial court. That does in the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> because death revoked the
offer and they didn’t perform until after he died.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the other hand, the California Supreme Court finds that the offer was for a <i>bilateral</i>
contract. Mr. Davis promised by mail to
come to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The California
Supreme Court finds that this is the promise that was bargained for.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
doctrine is “at least moderately complicated”. Note how the different courts came to different conclusions.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Which
court is right?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> wrote another letter after the first one changing
their mind?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> are getting their expectation interest protected <i>with
a vengeance</i>. They didn’t put a whole
lot of effort into performance, but they’re going to make out like gangbusters
anyway. Note that if they only get their
reliance interest, a whole lot of money would go to the nephews.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Was
there really a bilateral contract? Was
there a promise for a promise? It seems
very doubtful that the promise the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> made would have been enforced
against them if they broke it. What if Mr.
Whitehead had sent a letter to the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> saying that he didn’t want
them to come? That is, what if he
revoked his unaccepted offer or repudiated the contract? </span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
shouldn’t easily buy what the California Supreme Court is telling us. Why did the court decide the case they way it
did? The court says lots of things that have
nothing to do with the law. This isn’t
really a law-driven decision.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> had a good lawyer. The lawyer got evidence in the record that showed that the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> were close to the
Whiteheads. The lawyer also got evidence
in that the nephews were <i>not</i> close to the Whiteheads. If you’re a human being, you may want to give
the money to the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. Being a human being can mess up the law. You must look at pretty much every case in
terms of doctrine. There would be no
case for the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> until the lawyer had mapped
out a way to find for the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> based on doctrine. But also we should think about <span
class=GramE>who</span> ought to prevail like a layperson would. If a layperson was thinking about this, they
would ask: “Who gets the money?” The
answer seems to be that the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> should get the money. If you provide a route for the court to get
there, they may well take advantage.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Was
there really a bilateral contract between the Davises and the Whiteheads? Was it possible for the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> to be in breach? Is it possible to have a contract that is
only binding on one side but not the other? Some of the difficulties are that this is an unusual and difficult
circumstances and the doctrine we have may not be all that great to help us
deal with it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
a common pattern: the old folks say to the young folks, “Come and take care of
me until we die, and then you’ll inherit everything.” As soon as that’s done, “various things
happen and trouble results”. These
situations involve large sums of money. Rarely are these situations thought through with care. There is rarely a lawyer involved; these
deals are often homemade.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
do we make of this case? Courts will
subconsciously or consciously manipulate manipulable doctrine to get to a
result that they find palatable. As a
lawyer, your goal is to show the court a path by way to doctrine to get to the
desired result and to give them an incentive to get there and make them feel
good about that decision.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
legal doctrines get in the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s way? First, death revokes an offer. Was the offer really revoked given that Mr.
Whitehead killed himself? The other
doctrine that has its virtues but also its problems is the statute of
wills. Why isn’t Whitehead’s <span
class=GramE>letter</span> a will? It
doesn’t satisfy certain formalities, such as being witnessed, under the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statute of wills. You don’t want to say all that in terms of
arguing the case, but you’ll hope the court will squirm to try to find for the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Don’t
forget that the nephews and the Davises were probably trying to settle. It would have been a lot less costly to
settle, but it would have been tough to settle, and in fact they weren’t able
to do so.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
a Restatement section we ought to know <i>by number</i>:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span>§ 45. Option Contract Created By Part Performance <span
class=GramE>Or</span> Tender</span></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span>(1) Where an offer invites an offeree to accept by
rendering a performance and does not invite a promissory acceptance, an option
contract is created when the offeree tenders or begins the invited performance
or tenders a beginning of it.</span></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span>(2) The offeror's duty of performance under any
option contract so created is conditional on completion or tender of the
invited performance in accordance with the terms of the offer.</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>An <i>option
contract </i>is an <i>irrevocable offer</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Would
this have helped the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> in 1934? Is this another “road” that could have been
taken to finding for the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>? No. What
the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> did was begin preparations, not perform. This section won’t help them.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
newer doctrine that is smaller in importance is § 87(2):</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span>An offer which the offeror should reasonably expect
to induce action or forbearance of a substantial character on the part of the
offeree before acceptance and which does induce such action or forbearance is
binding as an option contract to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
rarely applies: the offeror usually has no reason to expect reliance before
acceptance. The offeror supposes that
the offeree will accept first and <i>then</i> start relying on the newly-formed
contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
this a good theory for the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>? <span class=GramE>Probably not.</span> The nephews would welcome it. They would say that this enables enforcement
of the promise only as far as the reliance interest goes. The remedy would probably be limited. This theory would otherwise work, but the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Davises</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s lawyer would want to
avoid it if it had been available at the time.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="pettersonvpattberg.htm">Petterson v. Pattberg</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Pattberg
writes that he will accept cash for the mortgage. What legal label will we put on Pattberg’s
letter? If he says “I hereby agree”, is
it a contract? What is it? The preexisting legal duty rule doesn’t apply
here. This is an offer. No one has accepted it. There is a promise here, but it is
one-sided. It’s only an offer. It’s not supported by consideration. It will become a contract when consideration
is furnished. Many offers will start out
with “I hereby agree”. That doesn’t make
them a contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Sometimes
a good way to make an offer is to create a form that says “contract” with a
blank signature line for the other party.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
we start with an offer. What else can we
say about the letter? The court says
that what we have here is an offer looking toward acceptance by <i>performance</i>
rather than by <i>promise</i>. It’s 99%
clear that what <span class=GramE>is</span> being sought is a performance and
not a promise. Will the creditor want to
reduce the size of the debt in exchange for a mere promise? No way! The creditor won’t want to alter his legal rights until a payment is
made.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> says that the court is
right to find that the promise here is made in exchange for performance.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Pattberg
is getting something: he’s getting the debt payments early. The earlier you get money, the more <span
class=GramE>it’s</span> worth because of the time value of money. There is no preexisting duty to <i>pay early</i>,
and if you do pay early, I’m not going to make you pay as much as if you paid
on time.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
offer is relative. You can read this
offer as containing a promise that will be held open until a certain date: May
31<sup>st</sup>. Pattberg successfully
revokes the offer before May 31<sup>st</sup>. Why does Pattberg apparently get away with breaking his promise? Why aren’t promises to hold offers open enforced? Because there’s no consideration for the
promise to hold the offer open! When you
have a promise unsupported by consideration, it’s unenforceable! Offers are revocable, even though the offeror
has promised to hold it open.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
can change that. One way is with §
45. Once there is consideration or some
substitute for consideration for the promise to hold the offer open, then it’s enforceable. In other words, when something has been
exchanged for the promise to hold the offer <span class=GramE>open, that</span>
promise becomes a contract. In particular,
it becomes an <i>option contract</i> as seen in § 45.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
might have been consideration? Petterson
might think that his quarterly payment was consideration for the promise to
hold the offer open. That’s wrong. Making that quarterly payment was a
preexisting legal duty.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is all background to the case. The question
is: did the offeror get the offer revoked before the offeree accepted? Williston says as long as the offeror says “I
revoke” before the offeree says “I accept”, then the offer is revoked.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Petterson
is coming up the walk. He wants to pay
off the mortgage early and he’s all ready to do it. Pattberg says, “Who’s there?” Petterson says “I’m Petterson, here to pay
off the mortgage.” Pattberg says, “I’ve
sold the mortgage.” This is a <i>revocation
of the offer</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are three positions on this: Cardozo and three others, Kellogg, and then Lehman
and Andrews.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Kellogg
thinks that the offeree has to pay and the offeror has to take the payment for
there to be acceptance.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Lehman
says if we’re going to see it that way, then the offer is basically a trap. Lehman says that acceptance is saying that
you’re ready to pay when you have money in your pocket. Lehman thinks that this was done here and the
court should have found that there was a contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Cardozo view is that you have to <i>tender payment</i> before the offer is
revoked. This basically means that you
take the money and stick it in the other guy’s face. “Here’s the money! Take it! Take it!!!!!!!!!”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Petterson
made a formal tender after Pattberg partially opened the door. If you take the majority view, the acceptance
came too late. It came after the
revocation, and thus the offer had already been revoked.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Notice
that even if you take Lehman’s view, which isn’t a mainline view, and decide
that an offer to pay with the present capacity to do it would constitute acceptance
of Pattberg’s offer, it doesn’t necessarily get you out of trouble. Pattberg could have yelled “I revoke!” as
Petterson was coming up the walk. There’s
always the possibility that a revocation <i>barely</i> beats an
acceptance. If the revocation wins, then
there’s no contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Petterson
is out of luck!</span></p>

Prod. Corp. v. Shell Int’l Marine, Ltd.</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
ship is contracted to take some oil from </span><st1:place><st1:City><span
 >Beaumont</span></st1:City><span
>, </span><st1:State><span
 >Texas</span></st1:State></st1:place><span> to </span><st1:place><st1:City><span
 >Bombay</span></st1:City><span
>, </span><st1:country-region><span
 >India</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span>. This deal is negotiated between two
sophisticated parties. The tanker goes
all the way to the gateway to the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:
 14.0pt;'>Suez Canal</span></st1:place><span>, but then the canal is
closed. The ship turns around and goes
out through the Straits of Gibraltar, around the </span><st1:place><span
>Cape of Good Hope</span></st1:place><span>, and finally to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Bombay</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> where the oil is
delivered. The ship owners want extra
money, because it cost more to go the long route! The court says no way! Why in the world did the owner of the ship
think they should get more than they were promised?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
initial contract is discharged on one of two bases: (1) It was a </span><st1:place><span
>Suez Canal</span></st1:place><span> contract which became
impossible to perform when the canal was closed. (2) Assuming it wasn’t a </span><st1:place><span
>Suez Canal</span></st1:place><span> contract, there was,
nonetheless, a supervening event that makes it impracticable to perform the contract,
and thus the contract is avoided. Nonetheless, it is claimed that this carrier is not giving away its
service in transporting the oil. The
shipper wants to be paid on a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quantum
meruit</i> basis just what their services rendered were worth. It’s like when you go to the barber and sit
down in the chair: you implicitly agree to pay a reasonable price for the
services you’re about to get.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Judge
Mulligan doesn’t buy this theory. How
come? First off, the court struggles
with whether this was a </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
 '>Suez Canal</span></st1:place><span> contract or whether it was
a general </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >India</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> contract using either of
the standard routes. The court decides
that this is the latter: it’s simply a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >India</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> contract. The court finds that the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Suez</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> route was the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>planned</i> route, but it wasn’t a route
that was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>required</i> by the contract. The contract says, according to the court, we’ll
get this stuff from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >India</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> one way or another. In that case, performance was not rendered <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>impossible</i> by the closing of the </span><st1:place><span
>Suez Canal</span></st1:place><span> because the ship could have
taken the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Cape</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> route instead. There were two
alternatives, even though one was quicker and cheaper.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
once you have a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >India</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> contract, its performance
is not rendered impossible by the closing of the </span><st1:place><span
>Suez Canal</span></st1:place><span>. However, its performance is made much more
difficult and expensive. So will we
avoid the contract on the basis of impracticability? The court says no. The court says that this situation doesn’t
reach the level of difficulty required to call something “impracticable”. It costs a little less than a third more to
go around the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Cape</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> than through the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Suez</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> under these
circumstances. The court finds that it’s
not big enough of a difference to kill the contract. The court tells us that there is no bright
line. They say that it’s a tough question! These are some of the world difficult cases
in the world on which to predict results.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you have very similar facts to this, you may have an okay time predicting the
result.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
is there no excuse for the carrier? Well, it wasn’t the first time that the </span><st1:place><span
>Suez Canal</span></st1:place><span> had been closed. That part of the world was subject to war and
disturbance. You could see this one
coming; the closer you got to it, the more likely it was. There were plenty of warning signs before the
ship entered the Straits of Gibraltar. That’s one basis on which we’ll sometimes say that the ship owner is
bought by its promise.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Consider
UCC § 2-615 and its comments. If you can
see that a difficulty may increase the cost and expense of performing a contract,
what should you do? You ought to qualify
your promise so that you have an out if the difficulty materializes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Part
of how we decide whether to let the promisor off the hook is whether or not the
supervening circumstance is really surprising.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Mishara Contr.
Co. v. Transit-Mixed Concrete Corp.</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
industries where there are frequent strikes, contracts for the sale of goods can
be reasonably read to include the intention to perform whether or not there is
a strike. However, if you’re in a line
of trade where there has never been a strike or there hasn’t been one for many
years, then the occurrence of a strike might grant you an excuse even absent an
express “out” in your contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
you’re representing somebody, think about whether it is wise to qualify your promises. If you qualify your promises too much, you’ll
turn off the other party and you might fail to come to an agreement. Your ability to qualify your promises is
limited by the bargaining situation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Maple Farms,
Inc. v. City School Dist.</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>These
are serious and important problems! These are commercial contracts for the sale of a lot of goods over a
significant period of time at fixed prices. When that kind of a contract is made, what’s the purpose? The purpose is to shift the risk of the
market. The buyer wants to assure that
it will get the named goods at the price specified in the contract, and the
seller wants to assure that it will get the named price for the goods. This is understood as a risk-shifting
agreement.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the parties don’t want to shift risk, they can enter into things like
open-price agreements. If they choose
not to do that, we should be slow to grant an excuse because we figure the
parties knew what they were doing.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
in this case, the court concludes that the school’s expectation of getting milk
at a fixed price should be protected even though there was an escalation of
milk prices on the part of the Department of Agriculture. The supplier who signed onto the agreement
should have been able to foresee the possibility of rising prices!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The “yellow-cake” cases</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>These
are an extreme example. Westinghouse
promised to supply fuel uranium at fixed prices over a very long period of time
in order to encourage the building of nuclear power plants. Westinghouse had to buy the yellow-cake at
prices that became very high. But we don’t
grant an excuse. This is catastrophic
for Westinghouse. What do the buyers
do? They settle. They don’t want Westinghouse to go bankrupt
because they needed the uranium.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Price
escalation and inflation is rarely going to grant a fixed-price seller an
excuse. In order for it to do so, it
must be catastrophic and caused by a catastrophic event that tends to surprise
you.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span><a
href="krellvhenry.htm">Krell v. Henry</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
were the promises? Krell, the lessor (or
licensor) promised to make his rooms available on two days. Henry promised to pay £75 (probably
$8,000-$10,000 today!) for the availability of the rooms on those two
days. When somebody is paying that kind
of money for two rooms on two days, there must be something special going
on. What was going on was that the rooms
were on the procession route for the coronation of Edward VII. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Victoria</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> had ruled for 64
years. So there hadn’t been a new
monarch and a coronation in a heck of a long time. It’s a big deal! A really big deal!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
was a large market for being able to see the procession. Henry was in the business of setting up
stands and chairs for people to sit in and watch the procession. He would also set up concession stands. He would invite lots of people to watch from the
rooms and make them pay.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is all great, but then the King develops acute appendicitis. They had to cancel the procession. That’s the background of the case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Against
that background, the Court of Appeal excuses Henry from his performance, in
other words, his promise to pay £50. Why
excuse Henry from his promise to pay?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is the landmark case on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>frustration</i>. Why is this a “frustration of purpose” case
rather than an impossibility or impracticability case? The promise of the defendant is to pay £50. This promise is not impossible to perform. It’s not impracticable either. When you have a promise to pay a fixed sum,
the sum doesn’t go up because of the supervening event. Paying £50 isn’t impossible.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Another
thing in the background of the case is that Krell and Henry did not know the
King was having health problems. The
possibility of operating on the King hadn’t been foreshadowed. They had no reason to anticipate that. It was a surprising event.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Check
out Restatement Second §265 on underlying basic assumptions. The key question is whether the occurrence of
the procession was the basis on which the contract was made. The thing that tells us this is so is that
the price was so inflated. When the
procession is cancelled, it seems to be sensible to let the parties walk away.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
does it take to get relief here? Relief
is relatively unusual. § 265 says you
need not only the occurrence of a very surprising event, but also a party’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal purpose </i>must be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>substantially frustrated</i>. There are lots of things that could happen to
Henry that wouldn’t give him any relief. For example, if there is bad weather on procession day, Henry can’t get relief. That’s the kind of risk Henry would have
assumed. He won’t get any relief if that
contingency occurs. That’s not a
contingency the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract
was made.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Or
what if there’s an assassination attempt on the King? There’s no relief for Henry there
either. In any case, that one isn’t
going to be the occurrence of a contingency for which there was a basic
assumption that it wouldn’t occur. You
need something that makes the value of the performance that Henry bargained for,
and promised to pay for, essentially worthless. It’s not a failure of consideration as if Krell wasn’t delivering on his
promise, but it turns out that what Krell offers is worthless to Henry.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Some
of what the case says is somewhat off target. This was a path-breaking case much more for what it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>does</i> than for what it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>says</i>. It doesn’t make sense to make it a test
whether the performance of the contract was prevented, because this is definitely
not a case of impossibility.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
you look at § 265, don’t neglect the stuff at the very end.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
does the court distinguish the “cab to Derby Day” hypothetical? They struggle with this; </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> thinks they don’t
succeed. There are plenty of rooms from
which to see the procession and plenty of cabs that you can use to get to the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Derby</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
happens to the £25 that Henry had paid before the decision to operate on the
King and thus cancel the procession? In
this case, we don’t know because the parties abandon the suit over this. In </span><st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Chandler</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span> v. Webster</span></i><span>, a year later, the facts
are similar. The court held that money
paid down before the announcement of the King’s illness could not be
recovered. In addition, money that was
due to be paid before the King was announced as ill, but not paid, was still
due. That’s absurd! We have a transaction that has been disturbed
in such a way as to frustrate pretty much everybody’s purpose.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Later,
in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Fibrosa</i>, the British changed their
minds. Can the party who has made a down
payment but has gotten no performance get their money back? <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Fibrosa
</i>says yes. This was a contract by a
British manufacturer to manufacture some tailor-made machinery for a Polish
buyer. After the machinery was made, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Germany</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> invaded </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Poland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, and then you couldn’t
deliver anything to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Poland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. The Polish company wanted their down payment of
£1000 back. The seller was greatly
disturbed! The seller has a great
loss. They would argue that they should
be able to keep the down payment to the extent of their reliance. However, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>this</i>,
in turn, was fixed by an act of Parliament. As it turned out in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, we did better on this
issue and we did it without statutes. Under the facts of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="krellvhenry.htm">Krell v. Henry</a> </i>in our country, Henry would get
his £25 back.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
was Henry’s business to tell tickets to the coronation procession in Krell’s
rooms to see the parade. When the parade
was cancelled, people who promised to pay Henry will be able to avoid their
promises. The courts, in making
decisions of this sort, need to think about that.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
hotel and a sports club, unrelated businesses, make a five-year deal where the
hotel pays the sports club $3,000 per month for making the club’s exercise
facilities available to the hotel’s guests. A year into the contract, the hotel is destroyed by fire. It doesn’t make any sense to rebuild the
hotel. The hotel refuses to make any
more payments. The club sues. Does the hotel have a defense? Sure, because that is a frustration of
purpose case. The hotel gets nothing of
any use for continuing to pay for use of the club’s facilities, because there
are no guests. This is illustration 3 to
Restatement Second § 265.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
what if the club was destroyed by fire? Consult § 263: this is an impossibility case like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Taylor v. Caldwell</i>. The club
can’t provide services anymore because it has burned to the ground. The club will not be liable to the hotel.</span></p>

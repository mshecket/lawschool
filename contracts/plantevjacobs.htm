          The plaintiff contracted with the defendants to build them a house.

          Has there been substantial performance of the contract to build the

        <b><span style="font-size: 14pt">Rule:</span></b
        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          The contract was substantially performed if the performance meets the
          essential purpose of the contract. If the performance is substantial
          but incomplete and faulty, the correct measure of damages is the
          difference between the value of the house as it stands and the value
          it would have had if it had been built correctly. If there are a small
          number of small defects that can be fixed at some reasonable expense,
          that cost is allowed as part of the remedy.</span

        <b><span style="font-size: 14pt">Analysis:</span></b
        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          The court approves of the way that the trial court combined the two
          rules given above. The court rejects the contention that the item of
          the misplaced living room wall should be treated under the
          cost-of-repair rule as opposed to the diminished-value rule (which was
          actually used at trial). The court notes that the value of the house
          wasnï¿½t really diminished by the misplaced wall, so it would be
          economically wasteful to give the defendants money to knock down the
          wall and rebuilt it in the right place.</span

        <span
          >What�s a single-premium annuity? It�s an annuity that you pay for all
          at one time. Insurance companies sell these annuities. For a single
          premium of, for example, $100,000, you can buy an annuity that will
          provide a monthly payment for the rest of your life. How would you
          market and price these annuities if you�re an insurance company? You
          would be thinking about two things: (1) the current interest rate, and
          (2) how long will the annuitant live? You�d use actuarial tables to
          determine on average how long someone with the annuitant�s age and
          characteristics will live. The insurance company takes the risk of
          whether the annuitant will live a short time or a long time.</span

          annuitant will die <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">soon</i>.
          $100,000 could potentially go down the drain after three months. If
          you�re concerned about this, the insurance company will sell you an
          annuity that�s guaranteed for a certain number of years, even if the
          annuitant dies. But the payments won�t be as high per month.</span

        <span
          >Say the husband buys a straight life annuity on his wife. The husband
          spends $100,000. The husband and the insurance company assume that the
          wife is a healthy 55-year-old woman. But they were both wrong. The
          wife had terminal cancer and died four months later. The husband wants
          to get his $100,000 contract less the payment his wife received. Will
          he be able to do that? No, because the actuarial risk had already been
          shifted! The husband chose not to get a different annuity where he
          would have gotten less money but a guarantee of money after the wife
          dies. But what if the wife is dead at the time the annuity is
          purchased? The annuity contract will shift a whole bunch of risks, but
          according to case law it will not shift the risk that she was
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">already dead</i> at the time
          the contract is signed. The husband will be able to back out of the
          annuity contract. Remember that both
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">good</i> and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">bad</i> risks can be
          shifted.</span

          twin sister was sold at auction for $2000. They can�t rescind! This is
          just a mistake in judgment! Sherwood did not induce them to make such

          judgment is different from the seller�s. The buyer thinks the security
          will go up and be a winner. One of those parties is going to be wrong.

          warranty? These two ideas can produce quite different remedies.</span

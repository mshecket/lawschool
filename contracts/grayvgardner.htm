<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The defendant promised to pay
the plaintiff about $5000 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless</i>,
basically, more oil arrived in certain ports in the current year than the
previous year. Whether this condition
was satisfied depended on whether the Lady Adams managed to arrive before </span><st1:time
Minute="0" Hour="0"><span>midnight</span></st1:time><span> on October 1<sup>st</sup>. The plaintiff sued the defendant for the
promised money. At trial, the evidence
was in conflict, but the trial judge ruled that the burden of proof that the
oil arrived on time was with the defendants. The trial judge also ruled that the ship could not be considered to have
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>arrived </i>unless it was moored or
anchored by </span><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="0"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
 '>midnight</span></st1:time><span>. The
verdict was for the plaintiff, and the defendants appealed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> (1) Did the defendants
really have the burden of proof? (2) Did
the ship arrive on time?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> (1) The promisor has the
burden of proof to show that a certain condition occurred that would let him
off the hook by the terms of the contract. (2) As a matter of law, a ship has not arrived in port until it has
dropped anchor or has moored.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The only big point made by
the court is that the parties more or less made a wager and both chose to take
a risk. There’s nothing unfair about
it. Thus, the court should uphold the
deal.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The verdict of the trial
court is upheld.</span></p>

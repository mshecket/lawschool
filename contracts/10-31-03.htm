            >Suppose we have a deal between Ursula Ugly and Rick Rembrandt. Rick
            Rembrandt promises to paint Ursula Ugly�s portrait (with sympathy)
            and Ursula promises to pay Rick $10,000 if she is satisfied with the
            portrait. Say Rick paints, and Ursula is dissatisfied. Or, suppose
            Rick paints, and Ursula is too upset to even look at the painting
            and won�t pay him. Or, suppose that before Rick has begun to paint,
            Ursula finds that she can have Dave paint for $5,000. Rick sues. Can
            he recover? Or, what if Rick repudiates? If Dave would do the
            portrait for $15,000, can Ursula sue for the $5,000
            difference?</span
          ></b
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if Ursula is <i>unreasonably </i>dissatisfied with the painting,
          though in good faith? By the terms of Ursula�s promise, her promise
          has not be triggered (�switched on�). She has conditioned her duty to
          pay on being satisfied.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We divide the world of personal conditions of satisfaction in half.
          One type of condition of satisfaction is where we apply a good faith
          test; this is a condition of satisfaction that concerns �taste, fancy,
          or judgment�. The other type is what is called �operative fitness�.
          Say the seller promised to supply a great big boiler and the buyer�s
          duty to pay is conditioned on the buyer�s satisfaction. The
          interpretation is that if a reasonable person would be satisfied, you
          must pay because you can figure out objectively whether or not a
          boiler is built correctly (you can judge it against its blueprints,
          see how well it boils, etc.).</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >On the other hand, we determine whether a portrait is satisfactory
          based on the idiosyncratic tastes of the purchaser of that portrait.
          Likewise, if someone buys a tract of land, we�ll judge whether the
          land is satisfactory based on a subjective standard rather than
          objective standard.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There may not be a bright line, but there is a continuum. The case of
          Ursula is definitely at the �personal� end of the continuum.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What we�ve been talking about so far has nothing to do with
          consideration or mutuality of obligation. All we�ve talked about so
          far is the conditional nature of her promise.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if Ursula can�t ever bear to look at the portrait? In that
          situation, she is in breach.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One way to interpret Ursula�s promise is as a set of two
          alternatives: either (1) she�ll pay for the painting, or (2) examine
          it and express her dissatisfaction. If we find that either of these
          could be bargained-for consideration, then the agreement will be
          upheld. It may be that Ursula�s promise, overall, is quite flimsy. It
          may well be that Rick was foolish to agree to the deal. However, as
          long as there�s a deal, we�ll enforce it.<i></i
        ></span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Here�s the rub: if Ursula likes the painting, but lies about it
          because she wants to get out of what she sees as a bad deal, she�s
          liable for the price � in theory. But if you�re Rick, how do you prove
          she�s lying about her satisfaction with the painting? You might be
          able to get evidence from one of Ursula�s friends if she told someone
          that she actually liked the painting but was trying to cheat her way
          out of paying for it.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If Ursula breaches before Rick paints, she is in breach and her
          promise shall be enforced.
          <i>Not having the painting painted</i> wasn�t among the promised
          alternatives.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Note that Ursula�s promise is not illusory because it is quite
          possible to break it. However, it is a flimsy problem that may put
          Rick at some risk.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" />

        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s say Rick refuses to perform before he starts painting. Say
          Ursula goes to Dave DiVinci, who paints her picture for $15,000. Can
          Ursula sue Rick for $5,000? Rick made a flat promise to paint, and
          he�s plainly in breach. But the difficult issue is whether or not his
          promise is supported by consideration, and thus enforceable. The
          answer as articulated by
          <i><a href="omnigroupincvseattle-firstnatlbank.htm">Omni</a></i> is
          that her promise was not illusory, and therefore it constituted good
          consideration and Rick�s promise shall be enforced. You�ll see this
          over and over again.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Sometimes the condition of satisfaction is based on an evaluation by
          an expert. For example, maybe you will condition your payment for a
          building on a satisfactory report from a building inspector or
          architect. That�s part of what�s going on in

      <p>
        <span
          >Usually, the franchisor�s promise is as close to illusory as you can
          get. They want to be able to dump the franchisee quickly for any or no
          reason. How come? The franchisor has a huge interest in having each of
          its franchisees behave. For example, if a McDonald�s got rat-infested,
          it would give all McDonald�s restaurants a bad name. McDonald�s wants
          to be able to revoke the franchise really fast. We don�t police those
          agreements much in the courthouse. That�s hard on the franchisee
          because the franchisee must put up a big investment at the beginning,
          in reliance on an almost wholly illusory promise. Franchisees take a
          <i>big risk</i>. Is that fair? The common law and UCC have had very
          little effect on this.</span

          relationship. These statutes police the franchisor in terms of what it
          tells the franchisee. The franchisor has to disclose a lot of
          information. The statutes also control ways in which the franchisor
          can close out the franchisee. It is thought, however, that the
          franchisor needs a lot of power to maintain even quality throughout
          its franchises. This policing, therefore, is often a lot more modest

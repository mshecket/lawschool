          to make clear enough in the writing you send the customer so that
          anyone would get the message and thus be on notice. Then, whether they
          read it or not, you can claim that they should have

          >Does the change to $1,000 of coverage for silverware on the renewal
          policy change the dickered deal significantly? It�s not uncommon that
          an insurance plan doesn�t really insure. There are often deductibles
          or limitations on large losses. Is there anything wrong with that? No.
          That�s okay. The only serious question is: What did the parties agree
          do? As policy, it�s okay because it allows people to buy just the
          insurance they need at an affordable rate. The insurance company
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">can do this</i>, but the
          question is whether
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">they actually did it</i>. That
          is, did the insured people

          in this case, we have a renewal policy which changes the rules on the
          insured, the insurer has a burden of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">flagging </i>the changes and
          putting the insured on notice that the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">rules have changed</i>. Breyer
          thinks that it was adequately done in this case such that even a

          been made any more simple? On the other hand, doesn�t the �tonyness�
          and general fanciness of the place implicitly warrant the authenticity

          unchic.</span

      <p>
        <span

          recovery for Dr. Weisz and the Schwartzes? They point to the warranty
          in the catalog. They also say that this is an auction of old
          paintings, thus the painters aren�t around to ask whether they really
          painted the paintings. The best you can do is say: �We think the guy
          painted these paintings.� But nobody knows for sure!</span

      <p>
        <span
          >There are two ways to think about this case: (1) There was a flat out
          warranty that these paintings were genuine, and then it was
          disclaimed. But the better argument for Parke-Bernet was: (2) Of
          course they didn�t warrant they were genuine, and you, the buyer,
          should have known that too. Everybody knows there are a lot of
          forgeries going around and you can�t be absolutely certain about
          anything. Even without the condition of sale, it ought to be a case
          decided for Parke-Bernet because all they promised was that there is
          some expert somewhere, who might be wrong, who thinks the painting is
          authentic.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What we have here is a case where the deal could have been anything
          the parties wanted to make it. Parke-Bernet could have made a deal
          such that they absolutely won�t be responsible if they�re fakes.
          That�s an okay deal. But what deal did the parties actually
          make?</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Look at the additional facts. Think about how high the prices were.
          Both purchasers fancied themselves as serious collectors who both
          hired their own experts to look at the paintings before they bid. This
          tells us that there is a certain amount of risk involved in collecting
          art. The bargain is: They look genuine and the expert thinks they�re
          genuine, but there are fakers out there and they might be fakes, in
          which case we, the gallery, aren�t responsible.</span

          that Parke-Bernet intended not to be held responsible for forgeries.
          If the bidders believed that Parke-Bernet
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">did </i>intend to be held
          responsible, then we have to see which party�s interpretation is more

          with the �fairness approach� is that you�d have to litigate �standard�
          contract terms frequently, at least at first. You can�t simply read

          they do that limit liability? They think that most consumers want that
          because it lets the seller sell at a lower price. If the judge makes
          the contract, he has no similar economic incentive. He would want

          Easterbrook. One approach in the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Hill</i> situation is you have
          � 2-206. When people call in to buy goods over the phone or
          electronically, they�re typically forming a contract when they order.

      <p>
        <span
          >Another approach is found in � 2-209, where you have a contract
          without these terms originally, but then the contract is modified by
          agreement. The agreement comes when the consumer fails to return the
          goods within 30 days.</span

          >The Easterbrook opinions suggest that �cash now, terms later� is
          standard, garden variety contract law stuff for which no new doctrine
          is needed. But what doctrine is being applied? What can we say about
          this kind of situation? What�s the best argument you can make in favor
          of the Easterbrook position? Well, it�s a useful way to do a lot of
          business and it would be tiresome at best and burdensome in many ways
          to have all the terms laid out at the time of the deal because we�re
          dealing with complicated products. It would be difficult to get all
          the terms out on the outside of the package and make everybody read a
          lot of stuff. There is a lot of utility in �deal now, terms later�.
          How do we fit this into the existing law? Without making people read
          all the terms, you can flag the idea that the purchase is subject to
          some terms which will follow later. You can make the purchase subject
          to such-and-such terms to follow later.</span

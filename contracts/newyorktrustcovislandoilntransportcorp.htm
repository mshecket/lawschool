        ><span>
          was trying to get around some laws and they made up some Enron-type
          shell companies so they could make it look like it wasn�t really them
          doing the oil stuff where they weren�t allowed to do it. They made up
          these Mexican subsidiaries and basically owned almost all of the stock
          in them. They kept accounts showing payments between the Mexican
          subsidiaries and </span
        ><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt">Island</span></st1:place
        ><span>, and these accounts had balances due that </span
        ><st1:place><span>Island</span></st1:place
        ><span>
          theoretically had to pay the shell companies. Island mortgaged stock
          in the shell companies, and the stock was sold at foreclosure. In a
          bankruptcy organization type thing, the bank that bought shares of the
          shell companies sued the receiver of </span
        ><st1:place><span>Island</span></st1:place
        ><span> for balance due from </span
        ><st1:place><span>Island</span></st1:place
        ><span>
          to the shell companies. The bank�s claim was dismissed and the bank
          appealed.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Should legal duties be created by �utterances� designed to scam a
          third party?</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          The fact that a writing was a sham trumps the fact that it would
          otherwise on its face appear legally binding.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          It wasn�t really anticipated that the shell companies and the real
          company would ever be at odds since the latter created the former to
          basically scam the government. Naturally, you wouldn�t break a
          contract with yourself. But when the shell company and the real
          company get separated and have conflicting interests, it turns out
          that the fictional dealings between them have no legal force. They
          don�t become real.</span

          >We were talking about some problems last time relating to a debtor
          using pressure on a creditor using what�s known as a �full payment
          check�. The debtor tenders a check for less than he really owes, but
          he writes on the check �payment in full�. The debtor is trying to get
          the creditor to take the money and discharge the rest of the debt
          claimed against the debtor. When can a debtor get away with
          this?</span

        <span

      <p><span>So in this case, the creditor will lose his suit.</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But what if the words �payment in full� are scratched out and the
          words �payment on account� are written? What will happen when the
          creditor sues? The creditor loses. We like having the debtor be able
          to tender these �paid in full� checks.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The debtor has made an offer to fully settle the claim. The creditor
          either accepts the offer or rejects it and sends it back. We like the
          fact that the debtor can try that and we don�t want to discourage
          it.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Also, what is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">said</i> is
          overridden by what is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">done</i>.
          When you accept an offer with your actions, we�re not going to pay
          attention to your protestations in words.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So that�s how we went at things in common law. But we have some
          problems in some places like </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. UCC � 1-207 (1) used to be the whole thing. In 1990, subsection (2)
          was added. Before subsection (2) was added, some people argued that
          this section changes the common law.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Most courts thought UCC � 1-207 was never intended to apply to accord
          and satisfaction, but other courts �screwed it up� according to </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>, such as </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>. When the amendment to � 1-207 was adopted in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          in 1994, the 1989 Ohio Supreme Court ruling was overturned. So you
          can�t scratch out �paid in full� and write �under protest� or anything
          like that anymore when we�re talking about an accord and satisfaction.
          However, you can use language like this to reserve your right to sue
          down the line on other matters. This section generally deals with
          goods contracts on an installment plan and long-term, sizable deals
          where the buyer wants to take and use what is offered even though the
          contract was broken in some way.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say a debtor is exerting pressure on a creditor. That pressure can
          get super strong when the creditor is having difficulties.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say we have a car accident involving plaintiff and defendant.
          Plaintiff asserts a $500,000 claim against the defendant for
          negligence. The defendant denies liability on the basis that he was
          not negligent, that the accident was caused by the plaintiff�s
          negligence, and even if he is responsible, he should only be liable
          for $25,000 tops. Say both sides act in good faith. The defendant
          tenders a $10,000 full payment check. If the plaintiff cashes the
          check, can the plaintiff sue? If we don�t know anything else about the
          situation, it�s probably going to be considered an OK
          settlement.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But further assume that the plaintiff is in bad financial shape and
          the defendant knows it. Say the defendant decides to take advantage of
          the plaintiff�s situation by settling for cheap. Can the plaintiff
          still sue?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say an insurer tenders a check in satisfaction of a personal injury
          claim that is covered under the insurance policy. If the insurance
          company takes unfair advantage of the plaintiff, this may be
          considered bad faith and accord and satisfaction would not
          result.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the situation with a single defendant? The question is
          whether there has been too much pressure. If a creditor badly needs
          money, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">how much</i> advantage
          of that circumstance can you take while still being within the bounds
          of fair dealing? That�s a tough question that doesn�t have an
          objective answer.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s think about another kind of bad faith. Suppose Ben went to a
          self-help seminar to disgruntled consumers. The purpose of the seminar
          was how to make trouble for the business community. It was suggested
          that every time he gets a bill, he should write a check for 60% of the
          amount with a full payment legend. He is told that the businesses will
          be too busy to notice the legend and will cash the checks. This won�t
          work! How come?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >These debts are actually unliquidated. Ben knows that these debts are
          unliquidated. He�s also tendering these checks in bad faith. There is
          no bona fide dispute over the amount of the debts.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Businesses like having more than one way to win (�belt and
          suspenders�), and a more mechanical way to win is found in � 3-311
          (c), which provides some help for creditors (�organizations�). The
          creditor can send a conspicuous notice to Ben that any disputes about
          debts must be sent to a particular location (such as a P.O.
          box).</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In reality, most bills are paid really fast by people who don�t pay
          any attention to legends. That kind of organizational creditor will
          not get any notice of an attempt to settle a claim for less than 100%
          unless something special is done to notify them. At the special P.O.
          box, you have someone who is capable of dealing with this issue.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Another approach an organization can take is found in � 3-311 (c)(2).
          If you prove that you return the payment within 90 days once you
          realize it�s not really full payment, you can pursue the debtor for
          the full amount.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But all of subsection (c) is subject to subsection (d). Subsection
          (d) says that the claim will be discharged if, more or less, the
          creditor has no actual knowledge that the debtor is going to try to
          tender a check in full satisfaction of the claim.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>So Ben has lots of ways to lose, which </span
        ><st1:City

          forgive the debt in return for a tractor to be tendered in three
          months. J agrees. What does this mean? At common law, there were some
          things you just

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">can do</i> whatever they want

          figuring out what they intended to do, while it may be easy when you
          have a lawyer-drafted writing, it may be difficult with an informal,
          oral agreement between two individuals.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One meaning to put on this is an offer made by the creditor. The
          offer is: �I�ll discharge your debt if you give me the tractor on or
          before July 1.� If it is an offer, it can be revoked at any time. One
          method of revocation would be to sue the debtor before July 1. That
          would tell the debtor that the creditor has changed his mind. The
          offer could be revoked at any point, and if it is, we�re back to the
          creditor�s claim for the debt.</span

            ><a href="pettersonvpattberg.htm">Petterson v. Pattburg</a></i
          >
          kind of situation. If the offer is accepted before it is revoked, then
          there is a contract and the debt is discharged. If the offer is
          revoked first, there�s no deal.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So if you look at this situation as an offer made by the creditor
          that removes some of the ambiguity and it�s favorable to the creditor.
          You don�t want to punish the creditor for proposing a lenient
          solution. Why might the creditor change his mind? The debtor might
          suggest that the tractor is not forthcoming.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >On the other hand, there is a second approach. You say that there is
          a contract, not just an offer. The contract is bilateral. The creditor
          has promised that he will take the tractor in full satisfaction of the
          debt if tendered by July 1. The debtor has promised to tender the
          tractor by July 1. In this view, this should suspend the creditor�s
          opportunity to change his mind and sue before July 1. This treats the
          creditor more harshly.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Suppose the debtor doesn�t come up with the tractor on July 1. What
          can the creditor do? On this approach, that breach would enable the
          creditor to go back to the original contract. That would be beneficial
          to the creditor, assuming that the creditor has been lenient to the
          debtor and the tractor is actually worth less than the debt at
          issue.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >A third approach is to say that the debt is dead. The parties have
          agreed to abandon it and turn it into an exchange of a debt for a
          tractor.</span

          said you couldn�t do the latter two things. Why did the law persist in
          this way? The difficulty was that a creditor who has been lenient
          without thinking things through doesn�t deserve to incur much harm.
          The old law would protect creditors but also prevent agreements that
          might be beneficial.</span

          creditor has decided to abandon the claim on the debt. On the other
          hand, the restaters suggest that when you have a vigorously disputed
          claim, then it may make a good deal of sense to say that in a
          settlement agreement the plaintiff has given up the underlying claim

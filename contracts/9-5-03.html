          be useful for other purposes. Pompous then repudiates. The cabinet

          it would have cost him $10,000 to make the desk, and thus he would

          that $25 is the cost of delivery, $75 is the overhead cost, and $650

          is the market price. If Carl repudiates on the day before the

          the delivery cost is gone. Now the seller needs to get their entire
          profit in damages. Delivery is no longer a savable cost. So in this

          >The court in <i>Hadley</i> says: �We believe you have suffered a loss
          because of the defendant�s breach and failure to deliver in a timely
          way, but we�re not going to let you recover that loss. We are going to
          put you in a <i>lesser</i> position than performance would have
          done.�</span

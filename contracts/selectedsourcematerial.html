          equivalent of the UCC. The CISG tackles even bigger problems of widely
          diverging laws between countries. It governs the international sale of
          goods, which is becoming more and more common in an increasingly
          globalized world. The CISG has been ratified by the U.S. Senate. The
          CISG doesn�t match up with the UCC on every point, and at times
          proposes interesting alternatives.</span

            unforeseeable or uncertain losses, and you can�t collect on losses
            where there was a suitable substitute available on the market. You
            judge the value of the contract by what it would have been worth

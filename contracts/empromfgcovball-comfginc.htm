        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Empro wanted to buy Ball-Co�s assets. Empro sent Ball-Co a letter of
          intent to purchase their assets, but the letter required a later final
          agreement and other conditions. Ball-Co bailed and started negotiating
          with another buyer. Empro filed for a temporary restraining order. The
          trial court dismissed Empro�s complaint, saying that the letter of
          intent had no legal force based on its own insistence that it�s not a
          contract. Empro appealed to the Circuit Court.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          May Empro�s complaint be dismissed even if the parties intended to be
          bound by the letter of intent?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          A letter containing an agreement that is subject to the execution of a
          definitive contract has no independent force.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          Easterbrook makes a policy argument about why intent is judged
          objectively rather than subjectively in contract law. If intent had to
          be judged subjectively, every contract case would go to a jury, and
          that would be highly inefficient and very bad for business.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Looking at the letter, Easterbrook finds that Empro carefully
          insulated itself against the deal being binding. If Empro was free to
          walk, it stands to reason that Ball-Co was too.</span
        >

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <u><span>Question</span></u>
      </p>

        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          >The court is trying to distinguish the letter of intent here from the
          type seen in <i>Borg-Warner</i>, where it looks like the two parties
          are <i>not</i> free to walk away, even though they haven�t 100%
          settled on the terms of a final agreement. A breach of a legally
          enforceable duty to negotiate a final contract would consist of the
          failure to come to such a final agreement plus a demonstration of bad
          faith on the part of one party.</span

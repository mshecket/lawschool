F. 99.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The packing company hired
some dudes from </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>San Francisco</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> to go up to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Alaska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and work on salmon fishing
and canning. They at first signed an
agreement to get $50 each for the season. Before they left, they signed another agreement giving them $60
each. Then when they got up to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Alaska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, they refused to work
unless they were promised $100 each. The
guy in charge was forced to accede to their demands and make a new contract at
the rate of $100 per person. He tried to
tell them that he had no authority to make a new contract. When the dudes got back, they demanded their
$100 each, but the company would only pay them under the terms of the contracts
they signed before they left.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Was the contract made in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Alaska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> supported by fresh consideration?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> It’s not fair to coerce a
party into giving a promise in exchange for doing something you were already
bound to do anyway, and the law shouldn’t allow this.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court basically states
the rule and then asserts that the result follows really fast.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The judgment of the court
below is reversed.</span></p>

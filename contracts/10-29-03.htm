        <span
          >There�s a two-year lease from April 1931 to May 1933 to rent space
          for a women�s clothing store. Blumenthal promises to pay $175 per
          month for the first year and $200 a month for the second year. At the
          end of the first year, the defendant tenant talks to the plaintiff
          landlord and says the economy�s bad and the defendant is going to have
          to quit unless the plaintiff will take $175 per month for the second
          year, too. There was some factual controversy. The trial court held
          that the landlord promised to take the $175 in full satisfaction of
          the promise. Later, the plaintiff sued for the $25 per month plus the
          last month�s rest, and he got what he asked for. The trial court
          refused to enforce the landlord�s promise to take $175 instead of
          $200. If the landlord�s promise <i>had</i> been enforced, he would
          have only gotten $175 for the last month.</span

          of the contract. Why does the court refuse to enforce this
          modification? There is no consideration for the landlord�s promise.
          Paying the rent that the tenants were already bound to pay isn�t
          consideration.</span

        <span

          �preexisting duty rule�. What was the tenant�s duty? It was to pay the
          $<span class="GramE">175,</span> in fact, the duty was to pay more:
          $200 a month. It follows that the tenant
          <i>suffered no detriment</i> as a result of his promise to pay $175.
          The tenant was <i>already bound</i> to perform under the preexisting
          contract. When you think about it in those terms, the landlord got
          <i>nothing</i> in exchange for his promise. We will not inquire into
          the <i>adequacy</i> of consideration, but you have to get
          <i>something</i> for your promise, or on consideration grounds it will
          be unenforceable.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >One of the things this case is about is debtor pressure on creditors.
          Creditors are frequently in need of the money that is owed them. It�s
          expensive and it�s a hassle to have to sue and work hard to collect on
          your debts. Shall we allow debtors to haggle creditors down by
          threatening them with the possibility of having to go to court? No
          way!</span

      <p>
        <span
          >How could the agreement be made enforceable here? You just need to
          have some consideration, no matter how small. For example, Blumenthal
          might have given Levine some clothing as additional consideration, or
          he could have made his payments earlier than the parties had
          previously agreed. If you throw something into the deal that you
          weren�t under a preexisting legal duty to deliver, you can make your
          amended agreement enforceable.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >How do we distinguish this case from <i>Fried v. Fisher</i>? Fisher
          relied on the promise. He went out of the flower business and got into
          the restaurant business. That�s huge reliance.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >On the other hand, Blumenthal didn�t do anything different after the
          promise than he did before the promise. There was no palpable change
          in position. Blumenthal will argue that the reliance was
          <i>not going out of business</i>, but we would be forced to take his
          word for it. A bigger reason is that to enforce on the basis of
          reliance we need <i>detrimental</i> reliance; a situation where
          <i>justice requires enforcement</i>. There is nothing detrimental
          about Blumenthal�s reliance because he was under a preexisting legal
          duty to pay the rent. Justice doesn�t require any enforcement for this
          guy.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The commentary to Restatement � 73 (which states the preexisting duty
          rule) says even when there is no consideration on account of the

        <span

          <i>debtor</i> pressure. Someone asserts a claim against you (�pay me
          or I�ll sue�), and in response to that threat you promise to pay them
          to settle the claim. If the claim was made in good faith, we will

          preexisting legal duty rule, you don�t have to inquire into whether
          the promise was made under duress. This rule is a cheaper, faster
          solution than the more contemporary UCC � 2-209 approach.</span

          That is, a promise has been exchanged for performance. This is the

          when you promise a reward for finding a lost dog, you won�t take a
          promise to find the dog in exchange for the money. You�ll only take
          the <i>dog itself</i> in exchange for the promise of money (and then

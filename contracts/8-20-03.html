<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We
have a lawsuit here because Hawkins is seriously disappointed in the results of
the operation. What’s the first thing
you do when you’re going to file a lawsuit? You hire a lawyer. What does the
lawyer do? He/she thinks up theories
that the lawyer can use to turn the plaintiff’s hurt into a remedy. What remedy does Hawkins want? He wants the big bucks. (The damage cannot be undone, apparently.) That’s overwhelmingly the remedy we’ll deal
with contracts, torts, and most other civil lawsuits.</span></p>

theories does the lawyer come up with? The lawyer sues for negligence and breach of contract. What’s a synonym for negligence in this

negligence. If you allege negligence,
you allege a want of ordinary care.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
trial judge orders a nonsuit. The trial
judge takes the negligence claim away from the jury. They’re not allowed to think about it. On what basis does the judge do that? <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The judge can find that no reasonable person
could find negligence. The judge
believes it would be irrational for the jury to find negligence. The plaintiff has a loser on this count and
it never goes to the jury.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What
do we mean by “without exception”? It
means that the plaintiff’s lawyer did not object and did not reserve the right
to challenge the nonsuit on appeal. So
the theory of negligence has dropped out of the case. The appellate court doesn’t need to say
anything more about it.</span></p>

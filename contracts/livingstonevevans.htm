          The defendant�s agent wrote to the plaintiff and offered to sell some
          land. The plaintiff wired the defendant�s agent and said he�d take it
          at a lower price. The defendant�s agent wired back and said he
          couldn�t lower the price. At the same time, the defendant sold the
          land to someone else. Then the plaintiff wired to accept the offer,
          but to no avail. The plaintiff sued for specific performance.</span

          Did the offer, followed by the counteroffer, the defendant�s agent�s

          A counteroffer acts as a rejection of the original offer. A rejection

        <b><span style="font-size: 14pt">Analysis:</span></b
        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          The court says that if the defendant�s agent hadn�t sent the message
          about not being able to lower the price, there would be no question
          that there was no contract because the counteroffer was a rejection of
          the original offer. However, the court finds (narrowly) that the
          message from the defendant�s agent was not merely a rejection of the
          counteroffer but also a renewal of the original offer. In that case,
          as far as the plaintiff knew, the offer was still open when he
          accepted at the original price. The court thus finds that a binding
          contract was formed.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s think about UCC � 2-202 and related sections. Look at the
          <a href="handoutproblem1-28-04.htm">handout problem</a>. Let�s apply
          the statute to the problem.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Two corporations make a deal for the purchase and sale of 7,000 yards
          of carpet. The buyer sends the seller a purchase order. Then the
          seller replies with an acknowledgement. Time goes by, and the parties
          get into a hassle resulting in litigation over the deal. We�re asked a
          series of alternative questions about the introduction of various bits
          of evidence.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s start by thinking about what part of � 2-202 applies to this
          situation. It�s going to be the bit that says: �Terms with respect to
          which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree�. Then there�s
          an important �or� and the bit that talks about an integrated writing.
          That second bit relates to when we have a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">single </i>writing. We don�t
          have that in this case. We have a writing put out by the buyer and one
          put out by the seller. The buyer and seller have different intentions
          for the final expression of their agreement.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We have an agreement made over the phone followed by confirmatory
          memoranda. That�s the part we�re in. What does �agree� mean? How can
          one memorandum agree with another memorandum? People can agree with
          each other, but can pieces of paper agree? In this case, it means
          �coincide� or �match�. If the terms in the buyer�s memo match the
          terms in the seller�s memo, then our sentence is up and running. Such
          a term can�t be contradicted by a prior
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">written or oral</i> agreement
          or a contemporaneous
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">oral</i> agreement. But then
          there are ways to �explain� or �supplement�, ways to let in evidence.
          There�s a positive, �inclusive� clause, and a negative, �exclusive�
          clause.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If there was only one writing, we would look at the clause that
          starts �which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the
          parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such
          terms��</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Which terms match between the two memos in the problem? We have
          matching quantity and quality terms. We also have matching color
          terms. The pattern matches, the price matches, the shipment
          information (�rush�) matches. But only one memo says something about
          the cost of freight. �F.o.b. seller�s point� means the buyer will pay
          freight. �F.o.b. buyer�s point� means that the seller pays the
          freight.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p><span>So now we know which terms match and which don�t.</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Note that this is a contract for sale of goods where you have a big
          statute of frauds problem until there is a writing signed by both
          parties (or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">each </i>party).</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is some disagreement on who would pay freight. If the evidence
          is admissible, the trier of fact will have to resolve a �he said, she
          said� credibility problem. But the first question is whether the
          evidence is admissible. Can the evidence come in? Yes, because only
          one writing talks about it. The memoranda don�t agree on the
          cost-of-freight term. They match on some other stuff, but not on this.
          So this doesn�t fall under � 2-202 and the evidence isn�t excluded.
          Evidence that they were talking about 6,000 yards of carpet instead of
          7,000 yards <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">would</i> be
          excluded, because their memoranda
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">agreed</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How does � 2-207 relate to this problem? It says that a written
          confirmation that comes within a reasonable time of an oral agreement
          operates as an acceptance even if it states additional or different
          terms than those agreed upon. But what happens to the additional or
          different terms? The buyer says that we agreed over the phone that the
          seller agreed to the cost of freight. What if the seller says
          something different than what the buyer said? It depends on whether it
          is an �additional� term (� 2-207 (2)) or a �different� term. The buyer
          ought to be able to prove under � 2-202 that the seller agreed to bear
          the cost of freight. Under � 2-207, we find that adequate proof will
          make the contract on the buyer�s terms. On the other hand, the finder
          of fact could find for the seller and make the contract on her
          terms.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Note that the shipping charge will be significant because of how much
          carpet is getting shipped.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the disagreement about price? Can Susan Jones get the
          testimony about the price mistake admitted? What�s going to happen?
          It�s not going to be admitted because it contradicts a term on which
          the memos agree. Later we�ll consider the question of whether we can
          �reform� a mistaken writing.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Another way to look at it is that when the two parties wrote down
          $10.15 they agreed to replace the previous price with the new
          price.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the idea of the discount? What�s the fighting issue? The
          proffer is that there was an oral agreement for a discount of 2% if
          cash is paid within ten days of delivery. It doesn�t matter that it�s
          conditional. The seller will say this evidence isn�t admissible
          because it contradicts the agreed price term from the memoranda. How
          do you argue against that on behalf of the buyer? The fighting issue
          is: �What does �term� mean? Will we read it broadly or
          narrowly?�</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If we read it narrowly, then the memoranda agree on the price term,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">but</i> you could have a
          separate discount term. It would follow that evidence of that term
          should be admissible. Then you would have a �consistent additional
          term� that can be allowed to come in.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If we read �term� broadly, then the term will contradict and it can�t
          come in. If you�re a disciple of Corbin, you�ll want to read �term�
          narrowly, and if you�re a follower of Williston, you�ll want to read
          �term� broadly.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But how does the UCC define �term�? In � 1-201 (42), it says �term�
          means �that portion of an agreement which relates to a particular
          matter.� That doesn�t sound like it helps. Is there something to it
          that would bear on this argument?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If you�re arguing that you want to read �term� narrowly, then you�ll
          want to make a big deal about the word
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">particular</i> in that
          definition. That�s helpful to the liberal position.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >� 2-202 is a more liberal parol evidence rule than some of the
          preceding common law stuff where you would keep out stuff that would
          �naturally� be included in the writing. In the UCC, you only keep out
          stuff that would �<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">certainly</i
          >� be included in the writing.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How about the last bit about �rush�? The confirmatory memoranda do
          agree on �rush�. What kind of testimony is the seller seeking to
          admit? One way to get this evidence in is to not
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">contradict</i> the word �rush�,
          but instead explain it by a custom. Another way would be to run off to
          the Restatement Second and say that the word �rush� is being
          interpreted.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Code is favorable to �course of performance�, �course of dealing�
          and �usage of trade�. The negative part of the rule never seems to
          keep these sorts of things out. Check out � 1-205, where these terms
          are defined. If there�s a custom dictating how �rush� is defined, the
          court may adopt that.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The seller made reference to the August 11<sup>th</sup> phone
          conversation. That�s not admissible because it is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">subsequent</i> oral
          agreement.</span

        <span

          now. Next, we�ll go back to the casebook. We shall skip to�</span

      <p>
        <span
          >There is an exception to the exclusionary force of the parol evidence
          rule for fraud. Check out � 214 (d): prior or contemporaneous

          duress, mistake, lack of consideration� or other stuff.</span

        <span

          goods, signed by both parties. It�s some cotton coming on the ship

          different �Peerlesses�. The two parties are trying to show that

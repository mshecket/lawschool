          >Unless there is a totally frivolous suit, each side will pay its own
          attorney�s fees. On the other hand, the losing side of a case will
          usually pay the court costs. These costs are much lower than
          attorney�s fees because we subsidize court costs with taxpayer money.
          We do that to keep the courthouse door open and encourage people to
          settle disputes peacefully.</span

        <span
          >Note that we also do not give punitive damages for breach of
          contract. Emotional distress damages and punitive damages are
          <i>not </i>the same thing. Emotional distress damages compensate an
          injury. Also, since it�s so hard to figure out what emotional distress
          damages are, and there�s a chance to tell stories, such damages would
          involve a punitive component anyway. If the jury doesn�t like the
          contract breaker, the contract breaker will get penalized. The
          attitude that we have against punitive damages probably contributes to
          our attitude against emotional distress damages.</span

        <span
          >What about when a breach is also a tort? Usually you cannot get
          punitive damages, because the tort is most frequently negligence, when
          you couldn�t get punitive damages in the absence of a contract. If
          you�ve got an intentional tort, you may have punitive damages unless
          you�re in a particularly stingy state.</span

        <span
          >Think about attorney�s fees: under the American rule, we don�t make
          the losing party bear the winner�s attorney�s fees. However, people
          can contract them in. It�s not uncommon for agreements to say that if
          you don�t perform and I have to sue you, you�ll have to pay my lawyer.
          But is this really enforceable?</span

          >There might not be much to learn from this case. We have a contract
          for the sale for dead pigs for 7 cents a pound and a bunch of live
          pigs from </span

        ><span>
          for 5.5 cents per pound. The seller delivers the dead pigs, but the
          buyer doesn�t pay for them. Was this a �barrelhead� transaction? The
          court says yes. The court says that we should minimize the extension
          of credit. In order to deserve to get the dead pigs, the buyer needs
          to be tendering the price of the pigs, and the buyer doesn�t do that!
          How come?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s happening? The seller could have withheld the dead pigs when
          he isn�t paid, but instead, what does he do? The seller could have
          required payment against the delivery of the dead pigs, but he didn�t
          do that! He was lenient with the buyer and gave the buyer a break. The
          buyer was pretty much given the dead pigs on credit. That turns out to
          be a bad decision by the seller.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If the seller had been tougher, he would have gotten his money or
          would have put the buyer in enough of a breach that the seller could
          have peddled the dead pigs somewhere else and not be liable for the
          non-delivery of the live pigs. But the seller was lenient! Because he
          wavered on the buyer�s duty to pay for the dead pigs, the buyer is not
          in the kind of breach which terminates the entire contract and excuses
          the seller from the duty to deliver the live pigs.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Instead, the seller gets antsy about the live pigs and hauls off and
          sells them to someone else. This results in
          <span class="GramE">a repudiation</span> on the seller�s part as far
          as the live pigs are concerned. It�s another �who�s in default?� case.
          This is also about divisibility. Is this contract divisible? Check out
          � 240: if you can pair up performances in pairs that correspond, one
          party�s performance of half of each pair has the same effect as if the
          contract only consisted of that one pair of performances.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The seller�s delivery of the dead pigs triggered the duty to pay for
          the dead pigs. But then the seller hauls off and repudiates with
          respect to the live pigs! The defendant can recover for the loss from
          not getting those pigs on a counterclaim.</span

        <b><span>Divisibility</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Most contracts aren�t divisible. Most are �entire�, which is the
          opposite of divisible. In most contracts, you can�t divide them up
          into agreed equivalents. Take, for example, a standard construction
          contract. The basic agreement is to build a certain building according
          to certain plans. The owner�s promise is to pay some contract price.
          Generally, by agreement, there will be progress payments. Otherwise,
          there will be too much credit extended by the builder to the owner.
          The stages of constructing the building are not separable; they are
          just convenient times to pay part of the cost of the building. Such a
          contract will be interpreted as
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">entire</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Today we don�t need the common law difference between �divisibility�
          or �entire� contracts for the sale of goods because we have the UCC. �
          2-307 says that unless specified otherwise, all the goods have to be
          delivered and paid for at the same time. So � 240 applies to non-sale
          of goods contracts, not including construction contracts which are
          entire. Employment contracts are generally divisible at common law,
          but there are lots of employment statutes such as periodic pay
          statutes. The common law doesn�t do much work as far as employment
          contracts work. But in any case, most employment situations are
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">at-will</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Here�s a construction contract that would be treated as divisible.
          The builder will build three houses on three tracts of land right next
          to each other. Each house will cost $300,000. Each house is divisible
          from one another. If the builder finishes one house, he gets the right
          to get paid $300,000 for that one house even if he runs away and
          doesn�t perform as to the other houses. Damages for running away will
          be set off from his recovery for the first house.</span

          <span class="SpellE">shirtings</span> to be delivered. What happens?
          The seller tenders the stock on November 16 and the buyer says �I
          don�t want it! I reject it! Get it out of here! I don�t want to pay
          for it!� Why <span class="GramE">did the buyer</span> did that? It�s
          not likely that it was

      <p>
        <span

          get the <span class="SpellE">shirtings</span> from somebody else for
          cheaper, or else the buyer had second thoughts and wanted out of the
          deal. So the buyer rejects the goods (thrusts them back upon the
          seller) and says he won�t pay for them. Is this rejection rightful or

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span

          November 15<sup>th</sup> to mean �on or about November
          15<sup>th</sup>�. Thus, the trial court finds that the seller�s
          performance on November 16<sup>th</sup> triggered the buyer�s promise

          services contracts, only substantial performance is required to

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">perfect</i> tender is required
          (at least at common law). In the UCC, the current version is �

          accept everything, reject everything, or accept some units and reject
          others. Is this a good rule? If this rule was subject to so much

          Say you�re the buyer and you have agreed to buy a pair of shoes, size
          9. The seller tenders shoes that are size 8�. Under the perfect tender
          rule, the buyer doesn�t have to take the shoes. On the other hand, say
          the precise car you want is not on the lot because your favorite color
          is blue. You haggle on the price for a car that is blue with very
          specific accessories. You go in to pay for the car when it arrives,
          and it�s pink. You don�t have to accept the pink car! If the goods
          fail <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in any respect</i> to
          conform to the contract, you don�t have to take the goods! The perfect
          tender rule protects the reasonable, justifiable expectations on the
          part of the buyer and usually makes a lot of sense.</span

          buyer�s dock on or before August 15<sup>th</sup>. The tender of each
          side must be made at the buyer�s dock. Notice how this is different
          than the cow hypothetical. Tender is easier when the seller delivers
          to the buyer�s point because the buyer makes a tender by staying at
          home with the money.</span

          demanding $4.50 a bushel instead of $5. Is the buyer obligated to
          accept and pay for the tomatoes? No way! Under � 2-507(1), the
          seller�s tender is a condition to the buyer�s duty to accept and pay.
          The tender we�re talking about is a tender pursuant to � 2-601 which
          conforms to every aspect of the contract. #2�s may be okay, but
          they�re not what the buyer has contracted for! The buyer need not

          client. Is the buyer obligated to accept the tomatoes? The market
          price is $4 for #1�s. The buyer wants to reject and buy somewhere
          else. What should the buyer do? What happens if the rejection turns
          out to be wrongful? The buyer will have to pay damages to the seller.
          The damages here would be under � 2-708 (1) � the contract price minus
          the market price. There may also be � 2-710 damages � incidental
          damages for the cost of hauling the tomatoes over to the buyer�s

          they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract. This
          means that perfect tender doesn�t mean �perfect in the abstract�. It

          Let�s say that our tomato contract called for two deliveries of 250
          bushels each. It turns out that in essence the perfect tender rule
          doesn�t apply to installment contracts. Installment contracts require
          or authorize delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately

          contract may even <span class="GramE">be</span> an installment
          contract if the seller has a truck that can�t hold all the tomatoes
          called for in the contract. Delivery in separate lots would be
          implicitly authorized under the contract.</span

          >today, we would get the opposite result because the buyer can reject
          any particular installment that is non-conforming such that its value
          is �substantially impaired�. Notice how this echoes the substantial
          performance rule! But the impairment must be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">substantial</i>, and the defect
          must be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">incurable</i>. Maybe
          the defect can be remedied with a price allowance on the inferior
          tomatoes. If we have an installment contract, rejections will almost
          always be wrongful. Thus, if you represent a seller, try to interpret
          the facts to produce an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">installment contract!</i>
          That�s good for the seller! But don�t get too rambunctious, because we
          interpret contracts as for single deliveries unless we say otherwise
          in the contract.</span

        <span
          >Why is that? Perfect tender went with single-delivery and a softer
          standard went with installment contracts at common law. There are also
          policy reasons. Installment contracts tend to involve merchants with
          ongoing relationships rather than one-time deals involving consumers.
          Also, there isn�t as much need for nit-picking in installment
          contracts. So remember that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="oshinskyvlorrainemfgco.htm"
              ><span class="SpellE">Oshinsky</span></a
            ></i
          >
          would be decided the other way today because it is plainly an
          installment contract.</span

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span><a
href="hatleyvstafford.htm"><span class=SpellE>Hatley</span> v. Stafford</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
we have a lease for growing wheat from a landlord to a tenant. It’s written down. It’s brief and fully written down. </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:
 14.0pt;'>Stafford</span></st1:place><span> agrees to rent to <span
class=SpellE>Hatley</span> a certain number of acres at a certain price per
acre. </span><st1:place><span
>Stafford</span></st1:place><span> has a buy out option.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Stafford</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> seeks to exercise the buy out at the terms in the written agreement,
and <span class=SpellE>Hatley</span> doesn’t like that at all. His wheat crop is going to be worth a lot
more than the price agreed to in the written agreement. <span class=SpellE>Hatley</span> claims that
it was agreed orally at the time of the agreement that the buy out option would
terminate 60 days at most after the beginning of the lease. Thus, <span class=SpellE>Hatley</span> claims
the buy out option was dead and </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
 '>Stafford</span></st1:place><span> is trespassing. <span class=SpellE>Hatley</span> claims that
he should be paid the market value of his wheat.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
problem is whether <span class=SpellE>Hatley</span> is able to prove the oral agreement
that the buy out option was to end in the middle of December. The position taken by the defendant is that
the parol evidence rule prevents such proof, and therefore only the writing is
effective. That would mean </span><st1:place><span
>Stafford</span></st1:place><span> can buy out <span
class=SpellE>Hatley</span> at $70 per acre. The trial court lets <span class=SpellE>Hatley</span> introduce evidence
of the oral agreement.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
we might object: Why didn’t the parties just put it in writing? If not using the buy out option after 60 days
is important to <span class=SpellE>Hatley</span>, why did he sign <span
class=GramE>a writing</span> without that provision in it?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Even
when both parties to a contract have lawyers and sign elaborate agreements,
there will always be things that aren’t expressed in the writing.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
doesn’t seem to make commercial sense to let someone buy a crop worth $400 an
acre for $70 an acre. That suggests that
there really was an oral agreement. Also, consider the payment terms for the rent. The rent is $50 per acre and there are 52
acres. The total rent will be
$2600. $1800 was to be paid on January 20,
with the remaining $800 to be paid on September 20. If the buy out happens, that’s $3640. If you exercise the option in June, then the landlord
already has $1800 in his pocket, and then pays the option. It seems highly unlikely that the buy out
option would have made any commercial sense unless it would terminate at some
point <span class=GramE>between January 20</span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
is highly unlikely, in other words, that the parties would have agreed to
something that just <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>doesn’t make any
sense</i>. The tenant could get bought
out whether or not he had already paid most of the rent. Also, the writing seems to be pretty
incomplete. The parties must have
thought there was some relationship between the payments and the buy out
provision. The writing seems only to
cover some terms of the agreement; others are merely oral.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Should
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Hatley</span> be held accountable for failing to include
his intention in the writing? Should he
be punished? These are two unsophisticated
guys. They wrote down some things, but
not everything. What are we trying to
do? We’re trying to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>protect the justifiable expectations of the parties</i>. According to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>, it was not justifiable for
</span><st1:place><span>Stafford</span></st1:place><span> to expect that he could do
the buy out in the way he did, but it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>was</i>
justifiable for <span class=SpellE>Hatley</span> to expect he could grow and
sell his wheat.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> court tends to take the Corbin-type liberal
position. The writing is not given a “magic”,
unique and compelling force. Instead,
the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> court concentrates on the intent of the
parties. That’s the intent of the
Restatement, Second and UCC § 2-202. The
former is more recent than the latter and takes some of its ideas from it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=SpellE><b><span>Restatment</span></b></span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> Second §§ 209, 213, 214 and 216</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
apply these sections to both <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="mitchillvlath.htm"><span class=SpellE>Mitchill</span></a> </i>and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a href="hatleyvstafford.htm"><span
class=SpellE>Hatley</span></a></i>. These two cases are more or less couched in old-fashioned Restatement
First language.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
first question to ask, per § 209, is: Do we have integration (an integrated agreement)? <span class=GramE>An integration</span> is a
writing which <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>finally</i> expresses at
least one term of an agreement. Parties
negotiate, make offers and counteroffers, talk on the phone, write back and
forth, but after the agreement is reached, it is reduced to writing in many
situations. When you have a writing that
gives a final shape to at least one term of the agreement, we call it <span
class=GramE>an integration</span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Also
check out § 213 and the parol evidence rule itself: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>A binding integrated agreement discharges prior agreements that are
inconsistent with it</i>, because they have been <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>abandoned</i>. Those prior
agreements are integrated into the writing, and are therefore <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>irrelevant</i>. This is a fundamental idea to the parol
evidence rule, but it can be difficult to apply.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
how do you know if you have an integrated agreement? § 209 (2) says this is a question for the
court, that is, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>judge </i>and not the
jury. The judge does this before
interpreting the writing (see § 212). Generally, interpretation is also a task for the judge and not the jury.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
judge decides if we have an integration, decides what the written words mean,
and then the judge applies the parol evidence rule.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the agreement is integrated, it discharges prior inconsistent agreements. If the agreement is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>completely</i> integrated, prior agreements <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>within its scope</i> are discharged.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
parol evidence rule allows evidence to come to the judge. The judge is able to hear evidence out of the
earshot of the jury. Then the judge can
decide whether the testimony ought to be admitted or not. The judge first decides if there’s <span
class=GramE>an integration</span>, then interprets it, then decides whether we
have parol evidence inconsistent with the integration or within the scope of
that agreement.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
if you were applying the Restatement to the cases we’ve gone over, we would
first ask the question: Do we have integrations? </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> says the answer in both of
the last two cases, the answer was clearly <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>yes</i>. Both writings apparently had a final
expression of price, for example.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about negotiations in regard to removing the ice house in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="mitchillvlath.htm"><span class=SpellE>Mitchill</span></a></i>? Check out § 216. Evidence of a consistent additional term is
admissible to supplement an integrated agreement <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>unless</i> the court finds that the agreement was completely
integrated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Two kinds of integrations</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
seem to be two kinds of integrations: a partial integration and a complete
integration.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>parial</i></span>
integration is a final expression of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i>
of the terms of the agreement, but not all of them. A <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>complete
</i>integration is a final expression of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i>
of the terms of the agreement.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If,
in either of these cases, we have a partial integration, the additional terms
will be allowed to come in because they are not inconsistent.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
doctrine is very complicated! A smart
and artful judge can manipulate the parol evidence rule as an instrumentality
to screen out testimony the judge doesn’t believe or to speed a case through
the system.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Whether
<span class=GramE>an integration</span> is complete is a matter of the
intention of the parties.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>One
thing that might make an agreement completely integrated is a clause that
repeatedly appears in form agreements: “It is understood that this contract
contains all of the terms and conditions agreed upon between the parties and
that there are no outside agreements.” This is called an integration or merger agreement. It’s designed to make something a complete
integration. It will sometimes work, but
sometimes it won’t.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Do
we have a partial or a complete integration in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="mitchillvlath.htm"><span class=SpellE>Mitchill</span></a></i>? The court doesn’t say, but usually a Board of
Realtors form would be used that would have an integration agreement included. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="mitchillvlath.htm"><span class=SpellE>Mitchill</span></a></i>, the court quotes
some language that has sounds like standard boilerplate. The writing probably wasn’t carefully done to
deal with this particular deal. Instead,
this was a standard form that’s usually more or less fair. However, forms like this don’t necessarily
indicate much thought about the particular deal in question. A standard form wouldn’t consider the
possibility that there would be some question about an ice house on Lt.
Governor <span class=SpellE>Lunn’s</span> land. So was the integration complete or partial?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Check
out the Restatement § 214. Prior
agreements and negotiations are admissible (to the judge) to show whether or
not a writing is an integration and whether or not it’s complete. This is a pretty <span class=SpellE>Corbiny</span>
approach with a big interest in protecting the justifiable expectations of the
parties. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> admits that he is pretty <span
class=SpellE>Corbiny</span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
practice, you hear the phrase “the writing speaks for itself” very often. This is sort of a <span class=SpellE>Willistonly</span>
phrase. But what does that mean? You could translate this into Restatement
Second/Corbin terms: you could say that the contract was a complete integration,
that the oral term is inconsistent with the written agreement, the oral term is
within the scope of the written agreement, the oral term doesn’t bear on the
interpretation of the written agreement, and the oral term would not naturally
be omitted from the writing. You can get
this from Restatement §§ 209-210 and 213-216.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Usually,
though, a contract includes <span class=GramE>a writing</span> and some stuff
that’s outside the writing. If you
believe the stuff outside the writing, you’ll tend to consider it part of the contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Hayden v. <span
class=SpellE>Hoadley</span></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
defendants promised in <span class=GramE>a writing</span> to make certain
repairs on a house and barn. The plaintiffs
weren’t satisfied and sued. The defendants
wanted to prove some oral agreements that supposedly went along with the writing. They wanted to show that they would have
until October 1<sup>st</sup> to finish and they would only have to spend a
maximum of $60.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Was
there anything in the writing about when they must be finished or how much is
to be spent? Nope. What is contradicted if the parol evidence is
permitted? Under the written agreement,
when were the defendants to finish the job? One answer is: “We don’t know.” That might make the contract unenforceable for being too vague, but that’s
not going to happen. People often forget
to put stuff in agreements, and to fix that we have gap-filling provisions in
the common law and Article 2. For
example, we might read in the requirement to finish within a “reasonable time”,
or the requirement to do the work in a “workmanlike manner”. These gap-fillers help turn non-contracts
into contracts. But on the other hand, these
gap-fillers are usually only effective when there hasn’t been an agreement to
the contrary. In this case, there <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is </i>an agreement to the contrary.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
court uses gap-fillers to destroy the agreement that actually seemed to be
made!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
does the Restatement Second have to say? Comment (b) for § 216 says that you have to consider the consistency of
additional oral terms in light of all the circumstances. The meaning of the writing includes not only
express terms, but also terms implied by the bargain of the parties in fact. But we don’t include gap-filling rules that
the parties didn’t agree to. This
directly contradicts <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hayden v. <span
class=SpellE>Hoadley</span></i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We’ll
think about UCC § 2-202 in terms of the problem that was handed out
yesterday. § 2-202 is the source of much
of what is in the Restatement Second. It
states the parol evidence rule in a succinct way in one long, complicated
sentence. It was very carefully drafted.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
UCC says that the parol evidence rule will exclude any agreement prior to the
integrated agreement.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
is clear that the parol evidence rule nowhere bars an agreement <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subsequent </i>to the writing. It would be a fundamental error to exclude
from evidence a subsequent agreement. It
may have other problems, like failing the statute of frauds or lacking consideration,
but the parol evidence rule won’t kill it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>The parol evidence rule in
the UCC does not bar evidence of an agreement <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>subsequent</b> to the writing</span></i><span>.</span></p>

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The defendant�s son got very sick and was taken in by the plaintiff.
          The son was in the care of the plaintiff for 15 days until he died,
          and when the defendant learned of this he promised to repay the
          plaintiff for his help. The plaintiff sued to recover the promised
          money, but was nonsuited. The plaintiff appealed.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the father�s moral obligation serve as adequate consideration for
          his promise of payment in order to constitute an enforceable
          promise?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          A moral obligation may only form consideration for an express promise
          in three cases: (1) debts barred by the statute of limitations, (2)
          debts incurred by kids, or (3) debts previously discharged by
          bankruptcy.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The moral obligation of the defendant is not found to be of the kind
          that can form consideration for an express promise. Therefore, the
          defendant�s promise to pay the plaintiff was nothing more than a gift
          promise in the eyes of the law. In the court�s view, society has
          chosen to leave it up to the defendant�s conscience whether to pay
          back a purely moral debt.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The trial court�s decision was upheld and the promise was found not to
          be enforceable.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This would seem nearly analogous to the case where a doctor treats an
          unconscious person who dies without regaining consciousness. The
          difference would be that we don�t know whether or not the defendant�s
          son could have expressed an intention or lack of intention to repay
          the plaintiff. I think Mills has a better shot at Levi Wyman�s estate
          than at the father, who basically had nothing to do with the situation
          except the letter he sent after his son�s death.</span

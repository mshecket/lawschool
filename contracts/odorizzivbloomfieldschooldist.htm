        <b><span style="font-size: 14pt">Facts:</span></b
        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          The plaintiff was under contract as a teacher. He was arrested, and
          the next day he allegedly was pressured by his superiors to sign and
          deliver his resignation. He was cleared of the criminal charges, and
          then he sought to be reinstated by the school district.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>They refused, so he sued to
          rescind his resignation. He claimed that his resignation should not be
          enforced because, among other things, he signed it under the �undue
          influence� of his superiors. The defendants demurred to his complaint,
          and the court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint. The
          plaintiff appealed.</span

        <b><span style="font-size: 14pt">Analysis:</span></b
        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          The court need only find that the plaintiff adequately pleaded a case
          for rescission on the basis of undue influence such that the demurrer
          should not have been sustained. The court finds that in the first
          place, the plaintiff adequately pleaded his mental and emotional
          weakness at the time of signing the resignation due to his recent
          arrest and lack of sleep.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 14pt"
          >On the other hand, in considering excessive pressure, the court
          suggests a factor test, where the factors include, among other things:
          discussion of the contract at an unusual or inappropriate time or
          place, more persuaders than persuaded people, the absence of an
          attorney and the encouragement not to seek one out. All of these
          factors are present, so the court is willing to let the complaint
          proceed.</span

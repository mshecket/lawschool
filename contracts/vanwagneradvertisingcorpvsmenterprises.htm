        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The plaintiff leased space on a building to put up a billboard in a
          very desirable location. The building was bought by the defendant, who
          terminated the lease. The plaintiff sued for specific performance and
          damages.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Shall the plaintiff receive monetary damages or specific
          performance?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Specific performance is a possible remedy in cases involving real
          property or unique items.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court says that the contract was not made over real property
          <i>per se</i>, but rather over a commercial lease. The leased property
          was found by the trial court to be unique, but this court holds that
          this isnï¿½t sufficient to allow the remedy of specific
          performance.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court held that the plaintiff was entitled to money damages but
          not specific performance.</span

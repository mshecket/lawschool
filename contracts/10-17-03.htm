<p><b><span>Restatement
Second § 74</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>This
section is on settling legal claims as a basis for consideration.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
someone asserts a claim against you, one way to get out of trouble is to agree
to settle the claim. Dropping the
lawsuit could be consideration for the promise of money to settle, as long as
the lawsuit is valid. In that case,
there is a detriment to the promisee and a benefit to the promisor. That’s eazy.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about when the surrendered claim was invalid? Why would we allow the surrender of <i>nothing</i> to amount to consideration? If you have a legitimate settlement of a dispute,
we have an agreement that we want to enforce as a matter of policy.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the other hand, if the claim is more or less extortionary, we’re not going to enforce
an agreement to settle it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
surrendering a claim is not consideration <i>unless</i>:</span></p>

<br/>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span dir=LTR><span>The claimant who is going to drop the suit thinks
that they have a good claim (i.e. they’re not an extortionist).</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span
 >Duncan</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span>, even if you have an honest
belief in the claim, it <i>won’t</i> be consideration because it was not, in
fact, doubtful. We have moved from this
tougher test to one (in the Restatement) that protects the freedom to contract
more at the expense of enforcing particular unjust settlements.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
second bit of the Restatement § 74 says if you actually write down your promise
to drop your claim then this writing makes for valid consideration if that
writing was bargained for.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is often about title claims to real estate. If you believe you own a piece of land free and clear, you might want to
get somebody to sign a piece of paper that says that “yeah, the land is yours”. What we can do is get that somebody to sign a
“quit-claim deed” that says as much. If
we promise to pay that person for this deed, we can be held to it because the
quit-claim deed is valid consideration.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
somebody might say, “Please sign a paper that says you won’t bug me anymore.” If they promise money in exchange for such a
paper, that promise will be enforced.</span></p>

<p><span>Beth
Brat comes and paints the house numbers on your curbstone. <i>After</i> she’s done this, she comes to
your house and asks you to pay $25. You
don’t have to pay.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>There
is no ground for requiring payment for services you didn’t ask for.</span></i><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
what bases might we require payment?</span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span dir=LTR><span>If you have a contract implied-in-fact, like hailing
a cab, you’ll have to pay. The promise
to pay is implicit in the circumstances. You know, or certainly should know that you’re asking for a service from
someone who is in the business of charging for that service.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the hypothetical above, there was no contract implied-in-fact. We might call Beth a “volunteer” or “officious
intermeddler”. She goes “wee wee wee all
the way home”. There’s nothing doing for
her.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>However,
we will impose quasi-contracts when someone is unjustly enriched. In the case of Beth, the homeowner is not
unjustly enriched.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the rule were otherwise, we would just go around heaping benefits on people and
then send them a bill.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>You
don’t have to change many of the facts before you’re going to have to pay. Let’s say you see Beth start to paint the
number on your curbside. If you know she’s
there and don’t tell her to stop, you’re going to have to pay her. If you know it’s going on and have the chance
to say “cut that out”, you have to do so or else there will be a contract
implied-in-fact.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
we imply a contract in fact, the promise implied is for a <i>reasonable</i>
charge. There may be some variations as
to the definition of a “reasonable charge”, but we’ll accept the regular charge
of the provider of the service as long as it’s not way out of line.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="martinvlittlebrownco.htm">Martin v. Little, Brown &amp; Co.</a></span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Stuff
like this happens all the time to any sizable business enterprise. They’ll say stuff like “I can tell you how to
make more money.” Big companies try to
make it very clear that they won’t take any unsolicited suggestions and they
won’t compensate for them. If you make
an unsolicited suggestion, you’ll be told to “mind your own business and stop
being an officious intermeddler”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case has some good stuff about contracts implied-in-fact and quasi-contracts.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span>Collins
v. Lewis</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
deputy sheriff seized some cows that belonged to Kinne. Kinne said that he didn’t own the cows. The deputy sheriff realized his error and
found that they belonged to the defendant. The defendant didn’t have room to keep the cows. The defendant was told that the plaintiff
would keep the cows for him at the defendant’s expense. The plaintiff in fact kept the cows for 38
days until the defendant sold them. It
was held that there was a quasi-contract under which the defendant owed the plaintiff
for boarding the cows.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the defendant here had totally abandoned the cows (surrendered ownership) and
decided to have nothing more to do with them, there would not have been a quasi-contract
and the defendant wouldn’t have owed the plaintiff anything.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
the defendant said that he would not pay the plaintiff, but then later the defendant
recovered the cows by replevin and sold them to a third party. Does the defendant have to pay the plaintiff’s
expenses? If the defendant gets the
benefit of the cows having been kept, we might find that the defendant has been
unjustly enriched. We may say that the defendant’s
conduct speaks louder than his words.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>A
hypothetical on <a href="promisesgroundedinthepast.htm">promises grounded in
the past</a></span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
you were walking by a river and you saw a drowning man. The man couldn’t swim, but you could. You pull the man out of the river and save
his life. You discover that his name is
Dr. Moneybags and he is rich, rich, rich! You figure out what his projected future earnings would be and you realize
that you’re responsible in some sense for his future earnings. If you send Dr. M a bill for $7 million, does
his have to pay? Was anything traded for
something else? Not really. For there to be a consideration, what needs
to happen? You would have to bargain
while he’s drowning.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[1]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a> That didn’t happen.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is what we call past consideration. The
first thing to notice about past consideration is that <i>it isn’t consideration</i>. There is no trade or exchange in the cases
that follow. In the Restatement, when
you look at the material on consideration, it goes over both contracts with consideration
and contracts lacking consideration.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
Restatement § 86, they say we will sometimes enforce a promise on the basis of
a benefit previously received.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
thing about the hypothetical above is that <i>Dr. Moneybags didn’t promise you
any money!</i> We know, therefore, that
we cannot recover on the basis of an express contract. Can we recover on the basis of a contract
implied-in-fact? Is there any way to
infer a promise on his part? Is there
any unjust enrichment? There’s
enrichment, but it’s not unjust at all. I’m a Good Samaritan, an altruist, but also a volunteer and an officious
intermeddler who doesn’t <i>deserve</i> to get anything.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Distinguish
this case from the one mentioned in “Case 3” on p. 113 in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Dawson</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. Dr. Smith treats Jay Walker, who was hit by a
car and never regained consciousness before he died. There is no express promise to pay Smith for
his services, however, there is a contract implied-in-fact because Jay Walker
has been unjustly enriched and his estate must make restitution to Dr. Smith.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
difference here is that a doctor charges for his services; that’s the
expectation. Also, there is a public
policy consideration: we want doctors and hospitals to render these services when
they are needed, so we allow them to get paid, even out of the estate of the
deceased.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
Dr. Moneybags, just after you drag him out of the river, says “next week, I’ll
pay you a million dollars.” Now we do
have a promise. If we go and sue him
next week for the $1 million, will we be able to recover? There is no “garden-variety” consideration
here. If we’re going to recover, it will
have to be on a different theory.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
is very rare that we will enforce a promise based on moral obligation without
any valid consideration.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="millsvwyman.htm">Mills v. Wyman</a></span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here,
there was no enforcement. The
Restatement § 86 says that the result in this case was right.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>One
thing here that pushes against enforcement is the fact that the promisor got <i>no
</i>benefit. The benefit went to the son,
but the father was the promisor. Also, it
was a good benefit, but the son’s life was not saved. It’s not as big as the benefit of having your
life saved in <i>Moneybags</i> and <i><a href="webbvmcgowin.htm">Webb</a></i>.<i></i></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In <i><a
href="millsvwyman.htm">Mills</a></i>, the promise was what we might call a “bereavement”
promise, made pretty much right after the father found out that his son had
died. This is a circumstance in which we
will tend to allow people to change their minds.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="webbvmcgowin.htm">Webb v. McGowin</a></span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is the “human rudder” case. Webb was
injured.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In both
<i><a href="webbvmcgowin.htm">Webb</a> </i>and the <i>Moneybags</i>, the
promisor got a big benefit by having his life saved. That pushes toward enforcement.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here,
there <i>was</i> enforcement and the Restatement § 86 affirms that this was
right, too.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case is very strong on its facts for enforcement. The promisor performed his promise for eight
years and the performance stopped only upon the promisor’s death. The heirs decided to stop performing, and
they were held liable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
this case, the promise was made 28 days after the life-saving event. This was enough time to ponder the
surrounding facts and make this a deliberate promise. In <i>Moneybags</i>, the promise is made very
shortly after the doctor’s life is saved.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span><a
href="webbvmcgowin.htm">Webb</a> </span></i><span>is full of facts that push toward enforcement, but
you don’t have to change a heck of a lot of facts to get a different result.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In <i>Harrington
v. Taylor</i>, the defendant was attacked by his wife with an ax and the plaintiff
saved his life. The defendant promised
to pay the plaintiff, and paid a little but not more.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Should
these promisors be allowed to change their mind?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Next
Wednesday, we’ll look at <i>Kirksey</i>. How would it be decided today based on the Restatement of Contracts?</span></p>

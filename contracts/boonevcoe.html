        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The defendant made an oral contract with the plaintiffs to move to </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          and work on his farm for a year.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½</span>When they got there, the
          defendant repudiated and the plaintiffs had to go back to </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Kentucky</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. The plaintiffs sued for the cost of making the trip. The defendants
          demurred and won dismissal of the case. The plaintiffs appealed.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Can the plaintiffs recover reliance damages on a contract that is
          unenforceable under the statute of frauds?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Damages cannot be recovered when a contract is held to be
          unenforceable under the statute of frauds unless the defendant
          receives benefit from part performance of a service contract, in which
          case the plaintiff may obtain restitution for services rendered.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          Because the defendant received no benefit, he has no obligation to
          pay, since the contract was unenforceable in the first place.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The judgment of the lower court was affirmed.</span>
      </p>

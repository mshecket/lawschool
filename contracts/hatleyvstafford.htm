          could exercise the buy out option. Hatley claimed that there had been
          an additional oral agreement that the buy out could only be done
          within the first 30-60 days of the lease. Stafford came onto Hatley�s
          land and cut down the wheat in preparation for building a mobile home
          park. Hatley sued for trespass. The trial court allowed Hatley to
          introduce evidence of the oral agreement. Hatley won, and Stafford
          appealed on the basis that Hatley shouldn�t have been allowed to use
          the oral evidence.</span

          The parol evidence can only be introduced if: (1) the oral agreement
          was not inconsistent with the written agreement, and (2) the oral
          agreement was such that it might �naturally� be made separately from
          the written agreement �by parties situated as were parties to the
          written contract�.</span

          The court says that a term of the oral agreement must contradict an

          written agreement in order to be considered inconsistent with it.
          Therefore, this part of the rule is satisfied because the written
          agreement doesn�t say anything about a buy out.</span

          The court finds that the trial court was justified in admitting the

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The plaintiff was employed
by the defendant. His employment contract
was about to expire. He went to his boss
and threatened to quit if he didn’t get a new contract. The defendant said something that the plaintiff
took to mean that the defendant agreed to reemploy the plaintiff for another
year. The plaintiff was fired in less
than a year, and he sued. The defendant
won at trial, and the plaintiff appealed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Did the boss’s words form a
contract?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> If a reasonable person
would have taken a party’s words to constitute assent to the formation of a contract,
then that contract will be enforceable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court finds that it is
a matter of law whether or not the boss’s words could be understood by a
reasonable person as agreeing to form a contract. The court goes over the version of the events
given by the plaintiff and says that if that version of events is true, the
boss’s words would constitute assent to a valid contract of reemployment.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The judgment is reversed
and remanded.</span></p>

        <span
          >Smith lets Zimbalist have �this Stradivarius� for $5,000. It�s hard
          to tell whether you have a real Stradivarius or a fake, and there are
          a lot of fakes around. If violin really was a Stradivarius, it would
          be worth $20,000 on the open market. Zimbalist is surprised that the
          violin he picked was a fake worth only $1,000. What kinds of causes of
          action might he have?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >He could allege mutual mistake as to a basic underlying assumption:
          the assumption was that this was a genuine Stradivarius, but both
          parties were mistaken and therefore avoidance of the contract ought to
          apply, meaning that Zimbalist can return the fake and get his $5,000
          back.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >An alternative argument for Zimbalist that he and his lawyers pick in
          this case (for obvious reasons) is that there was a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">warranty by description</i>.
          The warranty is that �this is a genuine Stradivarius�. The warranty is
          made under UCC � 2-313(1)(b). The measure of damages is given by �
          2-714(2). That measure of damages is the difference between what the
          thing would have been worth if it was as warranted and what it
          actually was worth. Thus, Zimbalist would argue, he needs $19,000 to
          be put in the position performance would have done.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Thus far, we have learned that warranty liability is promissory, and
          the remedy is to protect the buyer�s expectation interest by putting
          them in the position performance would have done. Another remedy for
          breach of warranty is simply rescission. You wouldn�t want to do it in
          this case, because undoing the contract doesn�t get you as much
          money.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So both mutual mistake and breach of warranty can
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">potentially </i>lead to the
          same remedy. That�s one lesson from the case.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say we represent Smith. What defenses should he come up with? Smith
          could use mistake defensively. If he argues mistake, the result would
          be rescission, but he wouldn�t get to keep the $5,000. Suppose he
          believes that he ought to keep the $5,000. How does he argue that?
          First off, how might he argue that there was no warranty?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >� 2-313(1)(a) doesn�t help Zimbalist because Smith didn�t make any
          statement about the violin whatsoever.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >� 2-313(1)(b), on the other hand, doesn�t require the description be
          made by the seller in order to constitute a warranty. There is an
          excellent chance that Zimbalist�s statement in regard to the violin
          could be found to create a warranty. It�s very possible that there is
          a warranty created by the use of the word �Stradivarius�.</span

          gentle that is not broken by the horse bucking. The court says that a
          calm horse may buck under certain circumstances. So let�s say that
          you�re Smith again. Say both guys know that a genuine Stradivarius
          would be worth $20,000. Why would the violin change hands for only
          $5,000? It seems to make sense that they agree that it�s something

          an authenticated Stradivarius? Does it mean something that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">might</i> be a Stradivarius? A
          standard word of description in different contexts can mean different

      <p>
        <span
          >What does the word �car� mean? What is warranted by the description
          �car�? It depends on the circumstances. It depends on whether you
          bought a �car� from Toys �R� Us or whether you bought it from a car
          dealer. You would expect a car from a car dealer to have brakes and an
          engine and all that.</span

          >On the other hand, if you buy a �car� for $750 and it�s described as
          �runs good�, you get a whole lot less. When you buy it from a
          junkyard, you get less still.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One helpful index to what the seller has agreed to sell is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">price</i>. That will tell us a
          good deal about what the words of description mean. Two knowledgeable
          people bargained a price that is between the price of a genuine
          Stradivarius and the price of a fake.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Each party to the deal probably knows that the violin hasn�t been
          authenticated. There�s a chance, given the rarity of Stradivariuses,
          that it might be a genuine, but there is a bigger chance that it might
          be a fake. The price reflects the fact that these risks have been
          exchanged.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is also no mistake, because the underlying assumption was that
          it might be genuine but probably isn�t. There was no mistake as to
          that assumption whether or not it turns out that that violin is
          genuine.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If this argument doesn�t work for Smith, a fallback position would be
          that the contract should be avoided because it was based on a mutual
          mistake, in which case Smith loses $4,000, which is better than losing
          $19,000.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So what lesson do we derive from this problem? Sometimes a seller
          will want to use mutual mistake defensively against an aggressive
          buyer trying to win a big verdict based on breach of warranty.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Does the UCC take away the chance to argue mistake in a warranty
          situation? Let�s say a buyer could establish that there was a warranty
          that this was a genuine Stradivarius. Should we ever let the seller
          off the hook on the grounds of mutual mistake, limiting the buyer to a
          rescission and avoidance remedy rather than protecting the buyer�s
          expectation interest?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The answer depends on putting together � 1-103 with �� 2-313 and
          2-714(2). � 1-103 �grandfathers� in common law principles, including
          mistake. But do the provisions of �� 2-313 and 2-714(2) displace the
          law of mistake, or do we allow the law of mistake to supplement those
          provisions? Not every court will apply the statutes the same way, but
          a number of courts would allow the law of mistake to supplement if the
          seller is especially sympathetic. Once in a while, though not often, a
          seller in a warranty case can obtain some relief by using a mistake
          argument defensively.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span

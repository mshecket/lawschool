          >In the old days, juries were pretty weird. Jury members were
          neighbors of the parties to the case, and also witnesses, in a sense.
          The jury was sworn to tell the truth. If a defendant complained about
          the verdict, a jury that was twice as big (the <i>grand jury</i>) was
          assembled to examine the first jury. If the first jury was found to be
          wrong by the second jury, the second jury�s verdict would hold and the
          first jury would be <i>punished</i>! We are asked to imagine how
          unlikely it is that the second jury would actually elect to convict
          the first jury.</span

          >There were gradual changes in this system. Witnesses could be called
          who were not members of the jury to provide �expert� testimony.
          Eventually, slowly, the jurors were converted into finders of fact who
          were supposed to base their decisions on the evidence and not on their
          own knowledge.</span

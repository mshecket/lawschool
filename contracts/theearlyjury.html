<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the old days, juries were
pretty weird.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jury members were
neighbors of the parties to the case, and also witnesses, in a sense.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The jury was sworn to tell the truth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a defendant complained about the verdict,
a jury that was twice as big (the <i>grand jury</i>) was assembled to examine
the first jury.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the first jury was
found to be wrong by the second jury, the second jury’s verdict would hold and
the first jury would be <i>punished</i>!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We are asked to imagine how unlikely it is that the second jury would
actually elect to convict the first jury.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There were gradual changes in
this system.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Witnesses could be called
who were not members of the jury to provide “expert” testimony.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Eventually, slowly, the jurors were converted
into finders of fact who were supposed to base their decisions on the evidence
and not on their own knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

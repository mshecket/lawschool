        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Coomer agreed to sell corn to Oloffson. Coomer repudiated. Oloffson
          went into the market and covered by buying at current market prices
          which were higher than the contract price. Oloffson sued for damages
          of the difference between the market price and the contract price on
          the performance dates, but instead was awarded the difference between
          the market price and the contract price on the date of
          repudiation.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          By which date should the damages to Oloffson be calculated?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Pursuant to UCC � 2-610(a), one may await performance by the
          repudiating party for a �commercially reasonable time�. Then one has a
          duty to �resort to any remedy for breach�, pursuant to UCC �
          2-610(b).</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that if Oloffson had mitigated his damages under
          either � 2-711(a) or (b), he would have received the same damages as
          he was awarded at trial.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court found that Oloffson received appropriate damages at trial
          and thus upheld the judgment.</span

          McGee is a doctor and Hawkins was his patient. Hawkins paid McGee to
          perform surgery on his hand. Hawkins testified that McGee guaranteed
          the hand would turn out �100% perfect� or �100% good�. It did not turn

          The court reasons by analogy to the case of a machine with a warranty.
          If the warranty is broken, the plaintiff gets the value they would
          have received from a fully working machine minus the value it actually
          has (plus incidental losses resulting from failing to comply with the
          warranty).</span

          and above what the plaintiff had before the surgery.</span

          >The court argued that the pain and suffering experienced by the
          plaintiff in the course of the operation should not be cause for
          damages because this is pain and suffering the plaintiff would have
          been willing to endure to make his hand better had the surgery been
          successful. Pain and suffering doesn�t necessarily measure the value
          of a good hand or the difference between that value and the value of
          the plaintiff�s current hand.</span

          damages based on the hand being made worse from the operation. The

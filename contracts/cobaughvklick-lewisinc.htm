        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          Cobaugh was playing golf. He got to a hole and saw a sign that said if
          he hit a hole-in-one he would win a new car. He did hit a hole-in-one
          and tried to claim his prize. Klick-Lewis, the car dealer, said that
          the contest only applied to a charity golf tournament that happened
          two days before. Cobaugh sued and the trial court granted him summary
          judgment. Klick-Lewis appealed.</span

        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          Did Cobaugh hitting a hole-in-one constitute an acceptance of a valid
          offer by Klick-Lewis and thus an enforceable promise?</span

          Making the rules of a contest public constitutes an offer that the

        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          The court says that the contest was not a proposal of a gift. Because
          the prize required some performance, the contest was an offer.</span

        <span style="font-size: 14pt"
          >The court also says that the agreement is not unenforceable on the
          basis of lack of consideration. The consideration that the dealership
          received in return for its offer was publicity, and the golfer got a
          car in exchange for earning a hole-in-one.</span

          Mitchill agreed to buy a farm from Lath on the condition that an ice
          house across the street would be removed. Lath agreed, but that

          sale of the property. Subsequently, Mitchill moved in and made lots of

        <b><span style="font-size: 14pt">Analysis:</span></b
        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          According to the majority, the defendant�s oral promise fails the
          third part of the test. The contract says a lot of stuff, but nothing
          about removing the ice house. The contract appears on its face to
          contain the all the responsibilities of each side. Basically, an
          objective observer would expect that if the parties really agreed
          about the ice house that they would have (and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">could </i>have) included
          something about it in the contract.</span

        <span style="font-size: 14pt"
          >The minority agrees with the statement of the rule, but not its
          application. In particular, the minority feels that there is a solid
          evidentiary foundation for the existence of the oral promise, and that
          the plaintiff reasonably relied on that promise in deciding to buy the
          property. Lehman says that the agreement to remove the ice house was
          �collateral to, yet connected with� the main written contract. Since
          there was no independent consideration for the problem to remove the
          ice house, Lehman figures it can only be enforceable if it�s tied to
          the same consideration as the written contract.</span

          >Though Andrews doesn�t tackle the issue directly, Lehman finds that
          the oral agreement doesn�t contradict any terms of the written
          agreement. Lehman points out that there is no express language in the
          written agreement that says that the defendants can only do that which
          is explicitly stated in the writing.</span

        <span style="font-size: 14pt"
          >Furthermore, Lehman finds it plausible that the parties would leave
          the agreement about the ice house, which was on a separate parcel of
          land, out of the document conveying the primary parcel of land from
          one party to the other. The question is, however, whether the parties
          intended to render the oral agreement non-existent by adopting a
          writing that didn�t include the terms of that agreement. Lehman thinks
          that the removal of the ice house isn�t so closely bound in subject
          matter to the conveyance of the land that not mentioning it should
          have the effect of making it void.</span

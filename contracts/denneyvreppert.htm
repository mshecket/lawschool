        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Some guys robbed a bank. The bank put out a $500 reward for the
          capture of each robber. The robbers got caught, and a whole bunch of
          people fought over who should get the money. The robbers were
          apprehended by three cops. They were helped by the bank employees
          because they disclosed a lot of important details about the crime.
          There were also the Reynoldses, who also gave some information. The
          Bankers Association asked the court to determine who should get the
          reward. The people who didn�t get the reward appealed.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> Who is entitled to the reward?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          When a reward is offered for performing some act, anyone can collect
          it <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">except</i> someone acting
          within the scope of their employment or official duties.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that the bank employees were basically just doing
          their jobs, so they get nothing. Two of the officers don�t get
          anything because they were also just doing their job within their own
          jurisdiction. But Reppert wins out because he was making an arrest
          that he wasn�t bound to make as part of his official duties.</span

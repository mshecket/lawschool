          >The result is good law in that you can count on it being followed
          today. You can limit remedies to repair and replacement of defective
          parts, but not when there is an accident resulting in personal injury
          or property damage. In that case, the limit will fall out. � 2-719 is
          a statutory way of doing this, but you can count on this being the
          result.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >You can explain the result in more than one way. One way is to say
          that the average adherent to such a contract wouldn�t understand a
          limitation to replacing defective parts as a bar to, for example, a
          wrongful death claim or property damage claim.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >If the manufacturer makes it very clear that there was an agreement,
          you must consider whether it�s an agreement society will let us make.
          Is the agreement unconscionable? Will we void it for its subject
          matter even though it�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">clear</i> on its face?</span

          situation where we�re just talking about
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">economic loss</i>. We�ll allow
          much more freedom of contract when we have merely economic loss than
          when we�re dealing with property damage, personal injury, wrongful
          death, and so on. Why is this so?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What argument can you make for a decision like
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Henningsen</i> as a matter of
          policy? </span

        ><span>
          says the best argument is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">deterrence</i>. Refusing to
          uphold a limitation on liability spurs manufacturers to make safer
          cars. We have a strong feeling about deterring the events that
          happened in this case.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are other incentives for manufacturers to produce safe goods
          besides liability. If they get a reputation for producing unsafe
          goods, they won�t sell as much and they might go out of business. It
          is a matter of debate how this incentive compares to the tort system.
          Another incentive is government regulation. Yet another is the
          morality of the manufacturers and whether they can sleep at
          night.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But a merchant <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">can</i> sell to
          a consumer a car with no brakes or tremendously defective brakes and
          not be liable at all for any injury to the consumer. The way you can
          do it is to be a particular kind of seller: �Joe�s Junkyard�. If you
          sell cars by the pound, there�s no particular expectation that the car
          will work. If you sell cars as junk and the buyer must understand that
          it�s junk because he�s paying a junk price for it then all he is
          entitled to is junk. If the junk kills him, it�s tough, unless the
          person was mentally incompetent or underage.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Some items are inherently dangerous and might cause injury, but there
          won�t be liability on the part of the seller, like kitchen knives or
          garbage disposals or guns.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >If we required that every used car sold should be in extraordinarily
          good condition, that would run up the price of used cars, especially
          older used cars, and it might make for a bad bargain for many members
          of the public. There would be, in other words, both benefits and
          costs.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This isn�t a sale case. This is a case where Mr. Richards is a truck
          driver and employee of the Monkem Company, and Mrs. Richards would
          like to ride along with him in the cab. The Monkem Company says that
          you can do that if you get special permission. To get that permission,
          you have to sign a form. Mr. and Mrs. Richards as well as the company
          sign the form. The form exculpates Monkem from any liability. Mr. and
          Mrs. Richards get into an accident and Mrs. Richards gets hurt. Mrs.
          Richards sues her husband on a respondeat superior basis.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But the main defense is that she signed a release agreeing that she
          wouldn�t seek any damages from the trucking company if she was injured
          while riding in the truck. Why doesn�t that work here?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court is quite divided: It was a 4-3 decision. Why does the
          majority find that the release won�t work? They find that the
          agreement went against public policy. They look at three factors that
          make the contract unenforceable in combination.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >First, they find that the contract serves two purposes. But what�s
          wrong with serving two purposes? Don�t most agreements serve multiple
          purposes? The two purposes are identified as �permission to ride� and
          �release from liability�. There is an obvious reason you would want
          both provisions in one agreement: one is a consideration for the
          other. Mrs. Richards gets permission to ride
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in exchange for</i> releasing
          the company from liability. The problem is that the title of the
          agreement only indicates one purpose. It doesn�t rub her nose in the
          aspect that�s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">bad</i> for her.
          There isn�t a sufficient �poison label� on this thing in the
          title.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Secondly, the release is said to be too broad. This release is full
          of legaldygook and is broader than it needs to be. It is poorly
          written. Why did the lawyer who drafted the agreement do it this way?
          It was probably copied from other, older forms and the lawyer was
          being extra cautious. It�s common that when you write releases from
          liability that you make them super-extra broad so there won�t be
          difficulties down the road. We want to make sure not to leave any
          loopholes through which a potential plaintiff can march through. So
          the thing is inartistically drafted. So what? It contributes to the
          unenforceability of the agreement. Would it be possible to read this
          agreement as to cover what actually happened? Maybe, but the court
          isn�t interested in doing this.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Finally, this was a standardized agreement that Mrs. Richards didn�t
          have a change to negotiate. It�s a take-it-or-leave-it form. It�s a
          contract of adhesion. But standardized forms have a good side to them
          too.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What was the company thinking about under these circumstances? The
          employee who signed this form was responsible for �risk management�.
          The employee is concerned with limiting exposure to liability. They
          would have liability insurance to cover lots of regular stuff. Also,
          Mr. Richards would be covered by workman�s compensation. So how can
          they lower their risk and insurance cost? They can have a no-riders
          policy. If they can enforce it, the only person in the cab will be the
          driver, and he�s entitled to workman�s comp. Now here comes Mrs.
          Richards, who wants to ride along. The approach taken by the company
          is: �If you want to ride, you absolve us from liability.� But it
          doesn�t work!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the end result of this case? Will the Monkem Company have
          their lawyer redraft the release for the future to make it satisfy the
          Supreme Court of Wisconsin? No way! You just really, really don�t
          allow riders anymore!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Could you really get a different result the next time around? Is this
          case really about agreements, or is it about a public policy that
          disapproves of such an exculpatory provision? Could you reverse the
          result before this court if the draftsmanship is better? Could they
          find a way to get a different result? </span

          going to come to a different result.</span

          Services of Phoenix. She is asked to fill out three papers. One is a
          consent to an abortion procedure. One is a medical history. The third
          is an arbitration agreement that says if there is any dispute, it will
          be submitted to arbitration under the American Arbitration Association
          and will be governed by a gynecologist.</span

          that she wants to sue instead of go to arbitration, so she does sue.
          The clinic urges that the case should be stayed or dismissed because
          it�s supposed to go to arbitration. But the clinic loses out. The
          arbitration agreement is struck down. How come?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >To keep this case in perspective, look at
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Vigil v. Sears Nat�l Bank</i>,
          205 F.Supp.2d 566. In that case, the arbitration clause was upheld
          even though there was lots of unequal bargaining power. But that was a
          credit card case, not a personal injury case.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But what�s wrong in the present case? The court says that the
          agreement is out of line with Broemmer�s reasonable expectations. That
          comes out of � 211, especially comment (f). An adherent of an adhesion
          contract won�t be bound to unknown terms if those terms are beyond the
          range of reasonable expectations. They
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">will</i> be bound to such terms
          if they are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">within</i> the
          range of reasonable expectation. That�s just in a comment, though.
          It�s not as carefully done as the back letter law, but a number of
          courts have hooked on to that comment and it has become part of the
          jurisprudence in this area.</span

          policy that the courts don�t talk about? The policy is lining the
          pockets of lawyers! These decisions are pro-trial lawyer decisions.
          Why don�t we want to arbitrate? There�s a 40% fee if we litigate! If
          we arbitrate, the fee will be much smaller. So perhaps there is a
          public policy in favor of trial lawyers. Both plaintiffs� lawyers and
          defense lawyers will agitate against arbitration. So who are the
          majority in these cases? They are judges in the courts whose election
          campaigns have been supported by the state�s trial bar. The
          dissenters� election campaigns were probably paid for by the state�s
          business community. These are cases where you can probably predict the
          result. Until the beginning of the year, the Ohio Supreme Court always
          went 4-3 for plaintiffs� trial attorneys, now it goes 4-3 the other
          way. </span

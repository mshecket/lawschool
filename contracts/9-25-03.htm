        <span
          >So far, we�ve been talking about money damages, which we call a
          <i>legal</i> remedy, or a remedy <i>at law</i>. Now we will think
          about <i>specific performance</i>. This is done <i>at equity</i>, and
          we call it an <i>equitable </i>remedy.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In Anglo-American law, we used to have two separate court systems. We
          had common law courts where we had <i>actions at law</i> for money. We
          also had chancery courts that were run by the Chancellor. These were
          courts of <i>equity</i>. Down through the ages, the courts of law did
          most of the work, but once in a while the courts of equity would step
          in.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Chancellors and their underlings used to be clerics: bishops,
          archbishops, cardinals and so on. The kind of law they did was
          �churchy�, �preachy� and �religiousitocious�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There were procedural differences between <i>suits </i>in equity and
          <i>actions </i>at law. There were no juries in courts of equity. In
          courts of law, you have the right to a trial by jury.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <i><span>The remedies are different. </span></i
        ><span
          >When the plaintiff wins in the cases we�ve considered so far, that
          plaintiff gets the big dough. But let�s say you�ve entered a money
          judgment and the defendant gives up, or appeals and loses. Then you
          have a money judgment that is totally final. How do you turn that
          judgment into actual, factual money?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The judgment is not a court order. The judge has not ordered the
          defendant to pay a certain amount of money to the plaintiff. The judge
          just enters something into the record that says there�s such and such
          an order. The trial judge moves on to the next case.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So how do you turn the judgment into money? Generally, the defendant
          will just ante up and pay, especially if they have enough cash to just
          pay. But what if the defendant doesn�t have enough money to pay the
          judgment, or try to hide the money they do have?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So you get the court clerk to issue a writ of execution so that the
          sheriff can go out and take the debtor�s stuff for auction so that
          your judgment might be satisfied. (Sorta like
          <i><a href="../civpro/pennoyervneff.html">Pennoyer</a></i
          >.) Actually, first some money from the sale of the defendant�s stuff
          goes to pay the costs of the sale and court costs. Then the rest will
          go towards satisfying your judgment.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If you�re a human being that doesn�t have enough stuff to pay a
          judgment, you�re colloquially called a �turnip� because you can get
          neither blood nor money from such a vegetable (or legume?).</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Sanctions in equity are totally different from those at law. If a
          judge orders the defendant to do something and the defendant disobeys,
          the defendant will be found in contempt. The judge�s prestige is on
          the line. So the judge can fine the defendant or put him in jail until
          he does what you tell him to do.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If you have no money and no prospect of ever getting any, you can
          shrug off a money judgment. However, if you�re given an order in
          equity, you may risk getting thrown in jail if you don�t do what
          you�re told.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>The standard remedy in cases at law is a money judgment.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >A purchaser of land has an absolute right to specific performance.
          You may also have a money judgment. However, in other cases, specific
          performance may be tough.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If a money judgment is adequate to do the plaintiff�s work, you�re
          not going to get specific performance.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why are we so stingy in the Anglo-American system with equitable
          relief? In other systems of justice, specific performance is much more
          common. Part of the answer is merely historical.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >For a long time, people have argued that you should be able to choose
          either specific performance or money damages. We haven�t listened,
          though. What�s wrong with giving the plaintiff a choice?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One reason is that court orders are more expensive to enforce than
          money judgments. The country that does the most with specific
          performance in the world is </span

        <span
          >The trial court denied specific performance, and we find in the
          higher court opinion that whether to grant or deny equitable relief is

          Wagner can get an adequate remedy through money. S &amp; M was turning
          around and leasing the billboard space to someone else, so you can

          example, a church had leased the space in order to keep the space free
          of advertisements that they found offensive. That church wouldn�t want
          money; they really want to control that space. But Van Wagner is in it
          for the big bucks, and if we can figure out the right amount of money

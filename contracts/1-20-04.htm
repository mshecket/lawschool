<p><span>We
haven’t heard the end of the controversy over cases like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="procdincvzeidenberg.htm">Zeidenberg</a></i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hill</i>. These cases are controversial. Easterbrook’s
decisions seem to have been followed so far.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
can be said for his decisions? They deal
with a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>convenient</i> way of making
decisions and they make sense to some extent.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
a consumer enters into a “deal now, terms later” deal, and the later terms don’t
eviscerate the earlier deal and are reasonable, then the consumer will be bound
by them. If all those factors are not
present, there will be a different result.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Next,
we’re dealing with other contract formation matters.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Offer, rejection, and
revocation by mail</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Two
parties communicate between each other at some distance. The communications go through the mail or
something similar. There are going to be
inevitable delays which aren’t present when the parties negotiate face to
face. When you’re face to face or on the
phone, the delay between getting the message out and having the message
received is pretty much zero. When you
operate through the mail, the letter will travel for a certain amount of time, which
will create problems. How will the law
deal with this?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
is an offer effective when it’s in writing, signed by the offeror, and mailed
to the offeree? It is effective when the
offeree receives it. Check out part of
the opinion. There’s a long inset quotation
from Corbin. “An offer by mail creates
no power of acceptance until it is received.” Offers are effective upon receipt. It’s not rocket science, all the rule says is that you can’t accept an
offer you don’t know about.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
we have a mailed offer to sell land. Say
the offer is mailed on Saturday but received on Monday. Then the offer is effective on Monday. On Tuesday, we have a revocation of the offer
by the offeror. Let’s say the revocation
is dispatched on Tuesday and it’s received on Thursday. When is the revocation effective? It’s effective on receipt. It would be unfair to the offeree to have the
revocation effective before the offeree receives it. This is a case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>objective mutual assent</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
offeree gets an offer on Monday. It
looks like an offer, smells like an offer, and sure enough <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>is</i> an offer which gives the offeree the power of acceptance. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Now the offeror starts thinking about
revocation. At this point, we cannot
have any <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subjective</i> meeting of the
minds, but we will have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>objective</i> meeting
of the minds when the revocation arrives.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Revocation
is effective <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on receipt</i>, not <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on dispatch</i>. For simple authority, try Restatement § 42: “An
offeree’s power of acceptance is terminated when the offeree receives from the
offeror a manifestation of an intention not to enter into the proposed contract.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
in our hypothetical, the revocation is effective upon its receipt on Thursday.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about rejection? Say the offer is
received on Monday and on Tuesday the offeree rejects the offer. Then on Wednesday, the offeree changes his
mind and wants to accept instead. Say
his rejection is received on Thursday. Will he get a contract? When will
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rejection</i> be effective?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Restatement
§ 38 says that rejection terminates the offeree’s power of acceptance. But when did the offeree effectively
reject? When is the rejection effective? “Rejection or counter-offer by mail or
telegram does not terminate the power of acceptance until received by the
offeror…” Restatement § 40.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Rejection
terminates the power of acceptance, but why? The legal consequence of rejection lies in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>probable effect on the offeror</i>. If the offeree states that he declines the offer, it’s very likely that
the offeror will change his plans. The
offeror can’t change his plans until he’s aware of the rejection.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Offer,
rejection, and revocation are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all
effective upon receipt</i>. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>However…</i></span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Acceptance is effective on dispatch
– the mailbox rule</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
in our prior hypothetical that the offer is received on Tuesday and an
acceptance is dispatched on Wednesday. Say then that on Thursday a revocation is received by the offeree, while
the acceptance is received by the offeror on Friday. Is there a contract or not? Yes. The contract becomes effective when the acceptance is dispatched by the
offeree.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is the rule of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Adams v. Lindsell</i>. We need to know what this case stands for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>by name</i>. It stands for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mailbox rule</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Acceptance
is effective when you put it in the mailbox. When you drop your acceptance in the mailbox, a contract is created. Acceptance can be effective on dispatch. But why is that our law? It is a rare and different thing that
acceptance is effective on dispatch.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
does Corbin have to say? He says that
you’re making a choice to burden either the offeror or the offeree. The mailbox rule places a greater burden on
the offeror and gives the offeree an advantage. We could do it the other way around and, in fact, in the rest of the
world, it is done the other way around. So why do we do it the way we do? Basically, it’s just because of the precedent of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Adams v. Lindsell</i>. It’s not
bad. On balance, the scales may tip that
way, or maybe they don’t.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
can you say in favor of the choice we’ve made? First, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>we need a rule</i>. Either rule is better than no rule. No rule invites lots of litigation and
decisions made on the equities. You
would have lots of hard cases. So we
need a rule. What argues for going in
the direction in which we go? The
offeror <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>starts the process</i>. The offeree wants and arguably needs a firm
basis for knowing whether or not there’s a contract at the time he drops his
acceptance in the mailbox.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>However,
there’s an exception. There are these
two U.S. Court of Claims cases involving the federal government. When the federal government is in the picture
and we’re in the Court of Claims, we have the acceptance on receipt rule. But that’s different than private party contract
claims.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if the acceptance is delayed or lost in the mail? That’s a contract anyway. The offeror might have a problem with it, but
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>too bad</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Restatement
§ 63 says that we won’t qualify “acceptance effective on dispatch” for the sake
of convenience. Even if the post office
screws up and delays or loses the acceptance, there will be a contract. How do you prove you mail something that the
post office lost? You testify that you
did. “Sometimes liars win.” It will be a question of fact.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Check
out § 1-201 (26), which says “A person ‘receives’ a notice or notification when
(a) it comes to his attention; or (b) it is duly delivered at the place of
business through which the contract was made or at any other place held out by
him as the place for receipt of such communications.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Some
of these things are arbitrary, but we need rules, and these do make a certain
amount of sense.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Notice
there is an exception for option contracts (irrevocable offers). Acceptance (or exercise of the offer) is only
effective on receipt. It need not be
effective on dispatch when the offeror is disabled from revoking.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span><a
href="morrisonvthoelke.htm">Morrison v. Thoelke</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
offerors are purchasers of land. The
land is in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and the offerors who want
to buy it are also in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The offerees are in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The offer is made in a pretty good way. The purchasers draft a contract, sign it, and
send it to the offerees along with a letter inviting acceptance having the
vendors sign the contract too. They do
so. Acceptance is effective on dispatch,
though it takes a couple of days for the acceptance to travel through the mail
on the way from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. During this period, the vendors decide it was
a bad idea to accept. So they telephone </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to try to repudiate their
own acceptance. The court in this case
says <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you can’t do that</i>. The court says that the contract is created
upon dispatch. The court says that since
this is a contract for the sale of land, specific performance is called for.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
did the court do that? Before the
offeror knew that the acceptance had been dispatched, they were told that the
offerees had changed their mind. What’s
wrong with letting the offerees do that? The problem is that it would let the offerees create their own option contract. If you had the opposite rule, the vendors
would have an unbargained-for option. If
the acceptance isn’t effective until receipt, then the offerees have an
unpaid-for option that it’s not fair for them to have.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Instead,
if you put your acceptance in the mail and then revoke before it arrives, your
revocation operates as a repudiation of an existing contract. On the other hand, if the offeror doesn’t
want a contract possibly because the offeror relies on the rejection that beats
the already-dispatched acceptance, then the offeror <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>should not</i> be stuck with a contract against the offeror’s
wishes. One way for the offeror to deal
with that would be to say that the offeree has accepted and then totally
breached the contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
how realistic, in business terms, is this risk of an unbargained-for
option? Is the rule all that justified
in this situation? It’s debatable. The justification for the rule is a good deal
less clear then it is in the situation of the “crossing revocation and
acceptance”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
kind of acceptance does an offer invite? § 65 says a medium of acceptance is reasonable and thus invited by the
offer if it is the same as the one used by the offeror. If the offer is mailed to the offeree, for
example, then that invites a mailed acceptance and triggers the mailbox
rule. Similarly, if the offer is
telegraphed, that invites a telegraphic acceptance which will be effective when
it is put in the hands of the telegraph company.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the offer is FedEx’d to the offeree, that invites a FedEx acceptance.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
any case, to have an acceptance effective on dispatch, it must be properly
addressed. If the address is messed up,
the acceptance will be effective on receipt, if it’s ever received. The acceptance must also have correct postage
in order to be effective on dispatch. All fees for transit must also be paid.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about a hand-delivered written offer? Say the offeror and offeree get together in the office of the offeror’s
lawyer, where the offer is hand-delivered. Say the offeree and his lawyer go to their office to chat. If they mail their acceptance, will it be
effective on dispatch? Probably not,
because that wasn’t the invited method of acceptance. You would have to hand-deliver the acceptance
back. When you hand-deliver, the
acceptance is technically in your possession until it’s received.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
has been a right by statute for some time to get back a letter that you’ve
already put in the mail. But in
practice, this is next to impossible. So
you can fish a letter out of the mail, but that won’t change the mailbox rule. But with your own employee as a messenger, if
you send them out to deliver an acceptance then you can call them right up to
the last minute and tell them to skip it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
mailbox rule imposes a burden on the offeror. What do you do about that if you’re an offeror? Notice the beginning phrase of § 63: “Unless
the offer provides otherwise…” The
offeror is still the master of the offer!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Consider
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kibler v. Caplis</i>. How do you explain it? Did the offer in this case negative the
mailbox rule? What other issues are
raised? Look at the problem on pp.
444-445.</span></p>

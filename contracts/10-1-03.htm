<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Courts will <i>only</i>
enforce the <i>negative</i> covenant when the person who repudiated your
employment contract is <i>unique</i>. If
you can hire someone who is just about as good for a comparable salary, you
haven’t suffered an <i>irreparable</i> injury. That is, you haven’t suffered an injury for which relief <i>at law</i> (money
damages) is inadequate. She’s <i>replaceable</i>. Your loss is <i>measurable</i>. There’s no need for an equitable remedy.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If you have a person of great
talent who can’t be replaced, then you may suffer an irreparable harm. The leading case in this area is <i><a
href="http://www.4lawschool.com/contracts/wagner.htm">Lumley v. Wagner</a></i>,
which involved two promoters competing over an opera singer. The Court of Chancery would not compel the
singer to sing. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>However, since the contract
was for a three-month exclusive engagement, there was an implicit negative
covenant. That is, the Court of Chancery
was willing to enjoin the opera singer from singing for anyone else, at least
in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>London</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Why would Lumley want to
restrain Wagner from singing for anybody else? Well, it’s a considerable arm-twister that might help Lumley get her
back. In fact, it didn’t work. As a tactic, this does not tend to work very
well in that the employee almost never comes back.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We don’t want to <i>compel</i>
an employee to work, but we will <i>put pressure</i> on the employee such that
they may choose to work. You always have
the legal power to quit. But if we
enjoin you from working for a competitor, that puts a lot of pressure on you to
go back to the employer from whom you jumped.</span></p>

<p><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When will we grant this
kind of an injunction? </span></i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>We’ll grant it when the remedy at law is inadequate. Typically, this is because the employee is
uniquely talented in such a way that they are made <i>irreplaceable</i>. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The court will not grant an
injunction if the talented performer bolts for a different market.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The most famous of the sports

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This case reflects a minority
position that courts will not enforce <i>implicit</i> negative covenants. Most courts won’t rule this way.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In this case, the matter is
at trial during the contract period.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Why weren’t money damages an
adequate remedy against Nap <span class=SpellE>Lajoie</span>? He didn’t really make that much money. It would be different today.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the sports and
entertainment market, it’s not too bad to have unwilling employees. They have an interest in performing and
maintaining their reputation whether they like their employer or not.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>One way this problem is
handled in major league sports is the fact that the major leagues have
monopolies over their sports. For
example, if you jump to another baseball league, MLB will have nothing to do
with you.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Let’s say the employment contract
has come to an end. When the employee
runs off and works for another company <i>during</i> the term of the contract,
the employer will have a remedy. But
what if, on the other hand, the employee contract is over and the person goes
and works for a competitor?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If you don’t have a
non-competition clause in the original employment contract, you can’t do
anything about it, except maybe to file a tort claim based on a theory of
conversion of trade secrets or customers. Tort law is rather unreliable for the protection of the employer. Instead, employers consistently include
non-competition clauses in their employment contracts.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Non-competition clauses are
subject to possible abuse, and therefore they are policed by the courts. Employees ought to be free to make a living,
and employers should not restrain competition.</span></p>

Chancery in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Here we have a big
construction project. We’re expanding
and modernizing a steel mill. The court
basically says that it won’t grant specific performance because supervision of
this project is too difficult.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This is an important
consideration, but it could be easily exaggerated. In school busing cases that were decided near
the same time, the courts supervised stuff that was arguably a lot more
complicated and difficult than modernizing a steel mill.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>On the other hand, here we
have a private contract that doesn’t impact social policy matters. Considerations of supervision are going to
cut against an equitable remedy. We want
to preserve some of the court’s resources for other important work.</span></p>

<p><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What’s the problem
here? </span></i><span style='font-size:
14.0pt'>The contractor is slow. <i>What
kind of lateness damages might there be? </i>There could be lost profits. But it may be hard to determine exactly what kind of money the mill
would have lost. Once the mill is up and
running, they may be able to get a better idea of what kind of profits they
lost by opening late.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>For these reasons, it’s
highly unlikely that you’ll get specific performance in construction contracts
like this. Money damages are going to do
just fine in most cases.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Another barrier to enforcing specific
performance is the vagueness of the contract. The court says that if they’re going to be called upon to enforce an equitable
remedy, it ought to be clear just what the parties are supposed to be
doing. It’s not terribly clear here. This is a problem of enforcement either at
law or in equity. Was there a promise of
putting on a second shift, as the plaintiffs claim?</span></p>

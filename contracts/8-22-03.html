<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Why
is <i><a href="acmemills&amp;elevatorcovjohnson.html">Acme Mills</a> </i>in the
book? To show you some of the effects of
our idea that we compensate the aggrieved party, and do that in terms of the aggrieved
party’s expectation interest. In this
case, we put Acme Mills in the position it would have been in if the contract
had been performed; no more and no less. If we eliminate the restitution damages, we find that Acme Mills wasn’t
actually harmed; in fact, they benefited from the non-performance.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What
effect does this scheme have on the contract breaker, or someone considering
breaking a promise? This is going to
influence their incentives.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There
are other sanctions for breaking promises other than legal sanctions. There is your business reputation. There is the sanction of your own
conscience. But what we’re concerned
about is what it means to make and break a contract.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Our
law would be a lot different if you got shot for breaking a contract. There would be a lot fewer contracts made,
and it would take a lot longer to enforce them.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Market
price</span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Another
reason <i><a href="acmemills&amp;elevatorcovjohnson.html">Acme Mills</a></i> is
in the book is to introduce the concept of <i>market price</i>. This helps us translate a loss into dollars
so the aggrieved party can collect the right amount of damages. You look at the difference between market
price and contract price. The idea is
that the buyer can replace the goods by buying them out on the market. When you give the buyer the damages, the
buyer can go out and get the goods and have everything he would have gotten if
the contract were performed.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
buyer must show contract formation and breach and must show damages.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Proving
contract is often easy. Proving market
price is easy for some things and more difficult for others.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>One
of the big jobs lawyers have is predicting what courts are likely to do. In a situation of a contract breach like
this, it can be easy to predict what will happen. Other situations can be much iffier.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Here
there <i>were</i> damages.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>How
were the purchasers hurt by the removal of the gravel from the lot? How much does it reduce the value of the
lot? <span class=GramE>In this case, not
at all.</span> But that’s not the
standard by which the appeals court determines the losses. The appeals court says the amount of the loss
is the fair market value of the gravel. It wasn’t the defendants’ to sell. The plaintiff should have had the chance to remove and sell the gravel.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If
the parties had agreed that the builder could sell the gravel, that’s
cool. But no such agreement has been
made. The gravel was kind of snatched. You can find an injury to the purchasers, and
they get compensated.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Compare
this to <i>Acme Mills</i>, where it seems that the breach didn’t harm the
plaintiff at all, and it fact it helped them.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We <i>do
not </i>focus on the gain through breach of the defendant.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>It takes
time before contract formation and closing. It’s a big ticket purchase, titles have to be checked, <span

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Since
the contract had not been performed, the title was still in the builder’s
name. What the builder did wrong is that
it broke its implicit promise not to take the gravel away.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>How
does UCC define “goods”? They are things

estate is the land. You can take things
from the land, but the location of the land is immoveable. The use of the word <i>moveable</i> is a way
to exclude real estate from Article 2.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What
about the building? We have a deeply
embedded idea in our law that buildings are part of the real estate. For example, the law building is real estate. The wall tiles are real estate. The ceiling tiles are real estate. The chairs we’re sitting on are <i>not</i>
real estate. They are tangible personal
property, and they can be governed by Article 2.</span></p>

of goods – Article 2</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><br>
The UCC doesn’t only apply to merchants. It applies to consumer-to-consumer sales, too. That’s not to say it doesn’t apply different
standards to merchants. But it doesn’t
make “<span class=SpellE>squiddley</span>-squat” worth of difference whether
either or both people are merchants.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Legal
vocabulary is sometimes painful. “<span
class=GramE>Can” can</span> mean a lot of things. It depends on the context.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>The common law began in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> and has a continuous
history since 1066. Civil law is derived
from the ancient Roman law, and it is codified, statutory law as opposed to
judge-made law. This is more common on
the Continent in </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Europe</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

>Asia</span></st1:place><span> and </span><st1:place><span
>Africa</span></st1:place><span> except former Commonwealth
countries.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>In today’s world, it’s very hard to find an area
where the common law governs without statutes interfering with it. The bulk of the law is common law rather than
statutes.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>Say you take a car in to be fixed. The mechanic will fix it and provide the
parts for one price. Then you’re buying
goods and services at the same time.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>The employment relationship is basically a common
law relationship, but it’s governed by various statutes. That can be true for other service contracts.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>Just as you have to distinguish real estate
contracts from goods contracts, you have to distinguish between goods contracts
and services contracts.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>Sometimes it’s easy to draw this line, and sometimes
it’s fuzzy. We can identify some
contracts as clearly Article 2 contracts, and others are clearly not.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>There has been a lot of litigation about this. One test is the “predominant factor
test”. Which factor predominates? In this case, the bill probably has an
itemized list of parts and labor costs. You could take the part that’s more expensive.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>Another way to go at it is to <span class=GramE>bifurcate</span>
the contract: Article 2 applies to the goods, and common law applies to the
services. This might make the action on
the contract unnecessarily complicated and expensive.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>If you hire someone to build a house, a lot of the contract
price will go for materials to build the house, while other costs will go
towards the labor. A contract like this
is considered a services contract. This
has been well-litigated. The Article 2
provisions don’t fit with a construction contract, especially in terms of
remedies.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>When the contractor goes to buy the materials to
build a house, the sale will be governed by Article 2.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>What about <span class=SpellE>Fido</span> and the
four-year-old car? Does Article 2
apply? Yes. These are both moveable goods. It doesn’t make any difference that the
parties are non-merchants and the sales are casual sales from one consumer to
another.</span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p style='tab-stops:495.0pt'><span>What about selling stock? Does Article 2 apply? No. That’s an investment security, which is specifically excluded from the
definition of goods in Article 2. Article 2 deals with <i>moveable tangibles</i>. <i>Intangibles</i> are not covered by Article
2.</span></p>

          >Somebody is interested in selling land. They write out an offer to
          sell the land and send it out on November 9<sup>th</sup>. They tell
          the buyer that they need an answer �at once� because there�s another
          deal pending. The letter gets to the purchaser�s place on November
          11<sup>th</sup>. The purchaser decides to accept the next day at </span
        ><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="15"
          ><span style="font-size: 14pt">3 PM</span></st1:time
        ><span> and dispatches a telegram to the seller. Then, at </span
        ><st1:time Minute="30" Hour="15"><span>3:30</span></st1:time
        ><span
          >, the seller sells to somebody else because he hasn�t heard from the
          purchaser. At </span
        ><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="16"><span>4 PM</span></st1:time
        ><span
          >, the seller gets the telegram. The seller then calls the purchaser
          and says �aw nuts�. So is there a contract or not? Was the acceptance
          effect on dispatch or on receipt?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The thing is that we�re trying to figure out if the acceptance was
          done with a method invited by the seller. Is the mailbox rule
          triggered by this factual pattern? � 63 would say: was �telegram� a
          medium invited by the offer? If it was, then the mailbox rule is
          triggered and the acceptance is effective on dispatch. When the offer
          is made by mail, usually acceptance is invited by mail too. Can a
          mailed offer invite a telegraphic acceptance?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The letter wanted a �quick� means of acceptance. Telegrams are
          reliable. You could argue that telegraphic acceptance is invited here.
          If I get a mailed offer today and accept by FedEx or DHL, do I get the
          benefit of the mailbox rule? It depends on whether the medium I used
          to respond was
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">invited</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But what�s another problem with making the acceptance effective at </span
        ><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="15"><span>3 PM</span></st1:time
        ><span>, assuming the mailbox rule was triggered?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So there are a couple of issues: (1) Did the offeror
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">invite</i> a telegraphic
          acceptance? (2) Did the offer �provide otherwise�? Does this offer
          negate the mailbox rule?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >You can argue that because the offeror says �I will have to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">know</i> at once�, the offeror
          is negating the mailbox rule. The offeror can�t
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">know</i> at the time of
          dispatch. Therefore, you can�t have acceptance effective on dispatch
          in this case.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So what follows if the mailbox rule was negated? The acceptance is
          effective on receipt. Therefore, there is no contract because the
          offeror took an action at </span
        ><st1:time Minute="30" Hour="15"><span>3:30 PM</span></st1:time
        ><span>
          inconsistent with the continued life of the offer. If the acceptance
          isn�t effective until </span
        ><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="16"><span>4 PM</span></st1:time
        ><span
          >, then do we have a contract? But the problem is that the offeree has
          an offer that appears still alive at </span
        ><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="15"><span>3 PM</span></st1:time
        ><span> and </span
        ><st1:time Minute="30" Hour="15"><span>3:30 PM</span></st1:time
        ><span> and </span
        ><st1:time Minute="59" Hour="15"
          ><span style="font-size: 14pt">3:59 PM</span></st1:time
        ><span
          >. The revocation of the offer is effective
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >when the offeree learns of it</i
          >, or at least gets reliable information of it<i
            style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >.</i
          >
          That didn�t happen
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >before the receipt of the offeree�s acceptance.</i
          >
          We have an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ineffective revocation</i>
          because it comes after the acceptance.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So the third issue is that the revocation is only effective
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">on receipt</i>. If the seller
          doesn�t want to be bound by this contract, what arguments can be made?
          The seller can argue that the offer has lapsed because the acceptance
          was requested �at once�. You could argue that the offer had already
          lapsed by the time of the acceptance. So the �at once� may be
          construed as �a reasonable time�. Maybe you have to reply on November
          11<sup>th</sup> or else the offer has lapsed. Or maybe �at once� can
          be stretched out to the first thing in the morning on November
          12<sup>th</sup>. It�s kind of flexible. So that�s a powerful argument
          for the offeror:
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">the offer was dead</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s another argument for the offeror who doesn�t want a contract?
          Is the acceptance really an acceptance? It sounds like it, but then it
          says: �Send contract for me to sign.� When was contract formation
          going to take place? It�s suggested that the contract will be formed
          at the time the �full-fledged� contract is signed. Also, what are the
          terms of this offer that we don�t know? There was some kind of
          �deposit� involved. Was the offeror asking for a �bipartite�
          acceptance? If so, then the offeror didn�t get it until after he said
          that he had made a contract to sell to a third person. There aren�t
          enough facts to resolve this, but we might want to get some more
          facts.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What else can we say about this situation? Maybe you could argue that
          there was no offer because there was no commitment on the offeror�s
          part. The terms of the offer were stated, though, and a response was
          requested �at once�, so it looks like an offer, but again, we�d like
          to hear more.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >These last two have some significant similarity because we can�t tell
          what she means. They�re like silence in that they are ambiguous. Keep
          in mind objective mutual assent. What did the offeree mean by being
          dumbstruck or bursting into tears? What interpretation did the offeror
          put on that conduct? When you have ambiguous, non-communicative
          conduct, generally we don�t have a contract.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Consider � 69, which talks about silence as acceptance. The most
          important word in this section is the word �only�. The cases where
          silence is acceptance are highly limited. Treatise after treatise will
          tell you, rightly, that silence as acceptance is the exception rather
          than the rule.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But what about the exceptional cases? Say you own a barn and you know
          the barn might burn down, so you have an interest in wanting it
          insured against fire. Say you bought a fire insurance policy a year
          ago. Now your insurance agent sends you a letter that says: �Okay, I
          know you want to renew your policy, so I�m just going to go ahead and
          renew it unless I hear from you otherwise.� Will that result in your
          silence being acceptance?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >It turns out that the insurance agent has given the barn owner reason
          to understand that assent may be manifested by silence. In order to
          reject the offer, does the offeree have to go out of their way to
          reject? No way! We don�t want the offeror to be able to force an
          agreement on the offeree. The offeror won�t get a contract simply
          because the offeree is silent. However, if the offeree
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">wants </i>a deal, they
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">can</i> get it by being silent.
          The offeree could choose to accept by being silent. In this situation,
          silence operates as an acceptance
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in favor of the offeree</i>,
          but
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not in favor of the offeror</i

      <p>
        <span
          >It�s especially unwise in the case of insurance: if the barn burns
          down, the offeree will claim to have accepted by silence. But you can
          also expect that if the barn doesn�t burn down, some offerees will
          claim that they didn�t assent and they�ll never have to pay. That�s
          the �risk of adverse selection�.</span

          the whip company which sometimes uses the skins to make whips. When
          somebody sends you goods under those circumstances and you don�t
          reply, will that catch you with a contract? Not in most circumstances,
          according to Holmes.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We won�t allow a stranger to send some goods to another stranger and
          say: �These are so good that I�m sure you�ll agree to buy them at this
          price unless you return them and say you don�t want them.� But the key
          word is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">stranger</i>. In this
          case, the seller of skins was
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> a stranger to the whip

      <p>
        <span

          from � 69 (1)(c). In this particular case, because of previous
          dealings, sending the skins forced the defendant to pipe up if it
          didn�t want to buy. The previous dealings create a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">duty to speak</i>. If you don�t
          pipe up, your inaction will be treated as an acceptance because
          acceptance is the

          then it <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">is </i>acceptance.

        <span
          >This common law rule has been changed by statute. There is now
          �unsolicited merchandise� statutes that say you don�t accept such
          merchandise by silence. People who send out unsolicited merchandise
          were considered pests and jerks. The approach taken by legislatures
          was to let the recipients of the goods keep them scot-free.</span

          with your name on it? I didn�t solicit from that seller, and the
          seller isn�t a jerk. Can I keep that computer as a free gift? The
          statute may be silent, but the seller may sue if you try to keep it.
          Often when the mistaken shipper prevails, courts decide not to apply
          the statutes.</span

          club, for example, and when you do, the goods you receive are not
          considered unsolicited. When you practice law, you�ll be bugged by
          book and software salesmen. You might sometimes think they�re jerks.
          Other times, you�ll want to get a subscription to some kind of book or
          software.</span

          and get your hair cut. When the barber is done, you say �thanks� and
          try to walk away. A
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">real contract </i>is created
          there. There is a contract
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">implied-in-fact</i> that you
          will pay a reasonable fee in exchange for a haircut. It�s implicit
          under the circumstances. There are lots of service providers for whom
          contracts implied-in-fact will be awarded.</span

          she sends me a bill. Am I legally obligated to pay that bill? No,
          because there is no contract implied-in-fact there. The presumption is
          that it was a gratuitous service between family members. You ought to
          know that a barber shop will charge for their service, but your mother
          will probably cut your hair as a gift. Thus, there is no implicit
          promise to pay your mother.</span

          jobs in different cities. After a while, the woman sues the man for
          all sorts of services including cutting his hair during law school.
          She thinks he ought to get paid for it. Will she be successful in that
          lawsuit? How do they think about it in

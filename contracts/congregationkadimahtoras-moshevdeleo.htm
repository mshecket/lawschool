<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The judgment of the trial
court was affirmed.</span></p>

<p><u><span>Note</span></u><span></span></p>

<br/>

decedent appeared to be serious about his promise. However, he did not go through any
formalities which would have made his promise enforceable in the eyes of the
law.</span></p>

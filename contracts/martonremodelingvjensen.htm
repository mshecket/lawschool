        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Marton did some remodeling for Jensen, then delivered a bill for
          around $6,500. Jensen thought this was excessive and offered to pay
          $5,000. Marton refused, but Jensen sent them a check for $5,000 with a
          condition saying that endorsement of the check would constitute
          satisfaction of all claims against Jensen. Marton refused again.
          Marton filed a mechanic�s lien on Jensen�s property, then cashed the
          check, writing �not full payment� under the condition. Marton sued for
          the remaining $1,500 or so. Marton won at trial, but Jensen appealed,
          saying that by signing the check, Marton effectively agreed to drop
          any possible claim.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did Marton�s cashing of the $5,000 check constitute an accord and
          satisfaction notwithstanding the words added by Jensen?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Accord and satisfaction is of a single unliquidated claim is not
          avoided just because the debtor only paid what he thought he
          owed.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court chooses to follow the common interpretation of UCC � 1-207
          in that it doesn�t change the common law rule of accord and
          satisfaction. The court says it is advocating the policy of allowing
          settlements in order to avoid litigation. The court finds that there
          was indeed accord and satisfaction in this case.</span

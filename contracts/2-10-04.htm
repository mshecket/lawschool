          is an elementary school teacher. <span class="SpellE">Odorizzi</span>,
          let�s assume, is charged with a serious criminal offense. But before
          too long, the charge is dismissed because they were brought without
          probable cause. He was arrested for something serious, but it�s a �bum
          pinch� and the charges are ultimately dismissed.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >After he�s been booked and comes back to his apartment, the
          superintendent and school principal tell him that there are going to
          be charges filed against him and that he�s going to get canned soon.
          They tell him that he has the opportunity to resign, but that he
          better hurry up and do it on the spot. He does so.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >He goes on to regret resigning, especially after he gets out of the
          criminal charges. He successfully gets out of the resignation.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >By the way, this is probably not a contracts case per se, but rather
          more a case of administrative law and how public schools are run. This
          case is in the book because it contains an articulate essay on
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">undue influence</i>, which is
          applicable to contracts. You can also apply this to gifts and wills,
          where an often elderly person is prevailed upon to make a gift to one
          child and not other children. The other children may assert that undue
          influence was used to get the elderly person�s favor.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What grounds can the lawyer use to get him out of his resignation?
          His lawyers say that he ought to be able to get out of his resignation
          on a whole bunch of grounds: duress, menace, (constructive) fraud,
          mistake, undue influence, or lack of capacity.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Did he lack capacity at the time he resigned?
          <span class="GramE"
            >Probably not, if we�re using a cognitive test.</span
          >
          There�s every reason to think that he understood what was going on
          even if he didn�t like it or didn�t feel that he had a free choice.
          Did he have the capacity to control his behavior? There�s no reason to
          suspect that he lacked capacity before or after this one
          occasion.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But the judge says that the one ground upon which
          <span class="SpellE">Odorizzi</span> has stated a case is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">undue influence</i>. If he can
          make his case at trial, he can have the writing rescinded.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What are the elements of undue influence? There is a dominant party
          and a <span class="SpellE">servient</span> party. One party has
          considerable strength, and the other party has some weakened capacity
          to resist. The <span class="SpellE">servient</span> party might be an
          older person in some cases. They may have some capacity if they�re not
          under pressure, but if you compound the difficulties of old age with
          excessive pressure, you�re on the way toward making an undue influence
          case. <span class="SpellE">Odorizzi</span> is weakened due to his
          arrest and the stressful situation he�s been through. The
          superintendent and principal come and pressure him into a
          resignation.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This case does <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> stand
          for the proposition that you can�t use
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">pressure</i> to obtain
          contracts. Whenever you make an offer, you�re exerting a type of
          pressure on the offeree. At least implicitly, you�re saying: �Take
          this, or we can�t deal. This may well be my best offer.� That�s a kind
          of pressure. <span class="SpellE">Offerees</span> sometimes make a
          counteroffer, and that�s pressure too. There is pressure involved in
          the making of most agreements, and that�s fine. But sometimes the
          pressure becomes too great and turns into �<span class="SpellE"
            >overpersuasion</span
          >�. You can use pressure to make a deal, including vigorous
          salesmanship. That�s perfectly okay. But sometimes the pressure will
          overflow the bounds and result in
          <span class="SpellE">overpersuasion</span> and undue influence.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >When you have pressure that is �coercive in nature� and �overcomes
          the will without convincing the judgment�, you�ll have undue
          influence. This is a doctrine with
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">soft edges</i>. It mustn�t be
          used too broadly and applied to situations to which it is not
          intended.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Where does it <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> apply?
          We can�t back out of a deal just because we have second thoughts.
          Hindsight is always better than foresight. You�ll always wish that you
          had bargained for better terms, but too bad. You take responsibility
          for your actions and abide by the contracts you make. It�s to your
          advantage to be able to make contracts and be bound by them, but you
          pay just the same thing as a price: you�re bound by the contracts you
          make.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This case tells you that there is usually a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">pattern</i> to undue influence.
          You don�t need all the elements in the pattern to have undue
          influence, and you can have many elements
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">without</i> having an undue
          influence case, but the factors the judge lists in this opinion tend
          to suggest that undue influence is present:</span

          the radar sets. That coerced Loral for two reasons: (1) Loral couldn�t
          come up with gear components from a third-party supplier by the time
          it needed them, and (2) its remedy in the courthouse would not be
          adequate to protect its interests. These two factors will not be
          present in many situations, and thus it won�t amount to duress.</span

        <span
          >But in the majority�s view here, there is economic duress because of
          Loral�s need for these gear components. Loral is on a government
          contract with strong terms in favor of the government, including tight
          deadlines and liquidated damages if Loral is late. Another factor the
          court mentions is the fact that Loral is a defense contractor. Loral
          only has one customer: the government. It needs to satisfy that one
          customer or else they�re in terrible trouble. Loral needs those gear
          components and it needs them soon, or else it will break its contract
          with the Navy. It needs future contracts with the Navy in order to
          survive. Under these circumstances, the threat of breach of contract
          can coerce.</span

          unsuccessful. None of the ten companies they asked could make the
          gears in sufficient time. Loral could have filed a suit to get
          substantial damages, or this could also have been a good case for
          specific performance. It�s a contract for the sale of goods, but you
          could argue that the remedy at law could be inadequate and quick
          specific performance is available. To the extent that such quick
          specific performance is available, that argues against Loral�s duress
          claim.</span

          for a smaller amount, such that the Golden Rule does not hold.</span

          $1,000,000 yet the Club�s expenses would have been $1,400,000. Let�s
          say Dempsey still repudiates. If the Club spends $300,000, they will
          only get nominal damages. However, if they spend $900,000, we�ll give
          them $500,000 to get them back to the $400,000 hole they would have

          than performance would have done. When there is proof to a reasonable
          degree of certainty of the financial position in which performance
          would have put the plaintiff, we won�t exceed that.</span

          Why? They would have to show what crops they would have grown and the
          market price of those crops. That seems okay. They
          <span class="GramE">would couldn�t</span> establish that they were

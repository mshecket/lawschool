          >This case is about the doctrine of reformation. The idea is that when
          we have a mistake in integration (like a slip of the pen of the wrong
          keystroke), under appropriate circumstances we will
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">reform</i> (fix) the writing to
          make it reflect the underlying agreement that has been reached.</span

        <span
          >What safeguards are found in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Hoffman</i> that are built into
          that doctrine? One safeguard is that we have a higher standard of
          proof for a reformation case than for other civil cases. For most
          civil cases, the standard of proof is �preponderance of the evidence�.
          For reformation, courts in various jurisdictions have various
          standards, but the most common standard is �clear and convincing
          evidence�. That is considered to be somewhere between the
          �preponderance� and �reasonable doubt� standards.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the biggest safeguard? What kind of doctrine is it? What keeps
          people from getting carried away by their emotions? This is an
          equitable doctrine. That means this is purely a question for the
          judge. Juries have nothing to do with reformation. Some suits are
          entirely about reformation, whereas other suits seek damages, specific
          performance and other stuff and reformation is one issue along the
          way. If the claim is mostly an action at law with a little bit of a
          suit in equity, the judge will look at the reformation outside the
          presence of the jury and fix it or not.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But what do you have to show by clear and convincing evidence? Why
          are we reforming the writing? We�re trying to conform it to the
          underlying agreement. Therefore, we must show the underlying agreement
          with clear and convincing evidence.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The deal in this case was for half a lot with one house for $3600.
          The writing described a deal for a whole lot with two houses for $3600
          also. That�s a good way to show the underlying agreement: $3600 is
          probably not the market price for two whole houses and a whole lot.
          These are strong facts.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >But let�s say there was an underlying agreement, but the parties
          changed it and came up with a final written agreement. Doesn�t that
          run into the parol evidence rule? Well, this doctrine doesn�t bar
          reformation, but the parol evidence rule might make it harder to prove
          that the parties had some different underlying agreement.</span

          were careless or negligent. The case also tells us that if we have a
          reformation case, the mistake must be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">mutual</i> (shared in by both
          parties). We can say this because the person who wrote the deed is

          oh boy�. This seems like a stronger case for reformation. However,
          many courts state that you can�t reform in the case of unilateral
          mistake. You may be able to rescind and back out of the contract, but
          you can�t reform. So that�s what courts

          buying both houses. They�re in good faith, they pay good money, and
          they don�t have notice. You can�t reform against that person.</span

        <span
          >Farmer Brown owns two farms and he�d like to sell one but not both.
          Pretty soon, both farms are going to get developed into suburban
          farms. A developer is interested in the farm that�s for sale (though
          he doesn�t know the farmer has two of them). Farmer Brown is in </span

          >. The developer references a certain road name, but the farmer goes
          by old county road numbers. Farmer Brown says he wants to sell the one
          on County Road 28. Farmer Brown says his price is $200,000. The
          developer sends a contract that describes the farm the developer want
          to buy, but not the one the farmer wants to sell. The developer later
          sues the farmer for specific performance. What can the farmer do about
          that? The farmer could potentially say that there was no subjective
          mutual assent. Whether there is objective mutual assent is a more
          difficult question. It sounds as if both parties were pretty careless
          and there isn�t any very good basis for preferring either party�s
          meaning. The farmer can probably make the contract go away because
          they didn�t reach mutual assent.</span

          you where the one I wanted to sell was. My meaning was much more
          reasonable than his. Therefore, the more reasonable meaning under
          objective mutual assent is the one I wanted. I will counterclaim for
          specific performance and to have the contract reformed to correspond
          with the underlying agreement (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"

          parties? We might say: �So what? Powerful and not powerful people
          ought to be free to make contracts with each other.� Lots of
          agreements between big, strong people and little people get enforced
          without batting an eye.</span

          >It may be easier for the plaintiffs to win by saying that they never
          agreed to the �a ribbon will do it� deal. Then the judge can decide on
          the basis of saying that �these parties didn�t agree, and thus you
          win�. That�s not as big a hill to claim as to say that �you agreed,
          but this agreement has no redeeming social value, so we won�t enforce
          it�. It�s much harder for a judge to strike down a contract as
          unconscionable than to strike it down as simply never having been
          made.</span

          wasn�t unusual. It is even allowed by UCC � 2-719. That section lets
          you limit damages in certain ways. Does that mean that this case is
          bad law? No, it�s good law. Why did the court do what it did in this
          case?</span

          Why should the result be any different here? One thought we find in
          the opinion is that a reasonable person would not get out of this
          language the idea that it disqualifies the car buyer from suing for
          personal injuries.</span

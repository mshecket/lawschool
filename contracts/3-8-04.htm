          of $500. If the buyer defaults, the seller can resell for $2500, but
          he would need $500 to be put in the position performance would have
          done. Can he recover? No! The buyer is not in default! Look at �
          2-507(1). The seller has to tender deliver of the goods before the
          buyer incurs the duty to pay. The seller would have to show up in the

          2-511, the answer is no, unless expressly agreed to otherwise. There
          is a concurrent condition running the opposite direction. In this
          case, tender of payment is a condition to the seller�s duty to tender
          delivery of the goods (the cow in this case).</span

          on February 1<sup>st</sup>, even though you can�t provide the money on
          February 1<sup>st</sup>. In this case, the lender/creditor has agreed,

          1<sup>st</sup>. <span class="GramE">It�s</span> 30 days open credit,

          goes and the seller doesn�t show up with the cow, then the seller is
          in default because the seller has made an unconditional and
          independent promise. The buyer�s promise to pay is conditioned on the
          seller�s month-early delivery of the cow. If the cow doesn�t arrive,
          the buyer�s promise to pay won�t be triggered. But the seller�s

          are damages if the borrower must substitute a higher-interest lender;
          in that case, the buyer�s damages will be measured by the difference
          in interest charges. In many cases, these damages will be zero or
          approximately zero because the credit market is highly competitive and
          a borrower will be able to get a substitute loan at an interest rate
          very close to the original one offered. So it�s unlikely you�ll get
          significant damages from this alone.</span

          can usually mitigate these damages by getting a substitute loan.
          However, in this case, the borrower wasn�t able to get a loan from
          most ordinary lenders. He had real trouble coming up with a substitute
          loan. And Van Lint
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">knew this</i> at the time of

          >In this case, there�s a deal for the sale of some land with a country
          hotel on it. The purchase price was $3500 (in 1896 dollars). How is
          that money to be paid? The agreement is, for starters, $500 down at
          the time of the signing of the contract. This is the extension of
          credit from the buyer to the seller before any deed is forthcoming.
          But the buyer would be in breach if he didn�t pay it! He was agreeing
          to extend such credit to the seller.</span

          pay $300 more on the price. That�s specified in the writing. The other
          things that are specified are the assumption of an existing mortgage
          and then a promise to pay $1700 in the future, such promise being
          secured by a mortgage.</span

          note and mortgage for $1700? What do we do?</span

          September the 15<sup>th</sup>, so we start with the proposition that
          the vendor wasn�t put in breach. But the purchaser says that his
          tender was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">excused</i>: the
          vendor didn�t have a good title! Is the vendor in default because he
          couldn�t have performed?</span

        <span

          date of performance of some lien or
          <span class="SpellE">incumbrance</span> which it is within the power
          of the vendor to remove.� Notice that in the sale of most land, there
          is an outstanding mortgage on the land right up to the time of closing
          because the vendor has borrowed money from a bank to mortgage the
          property. That mortgage is usually not entirely paid off when the
          vendor decides to sell it. How will it be paid off? It will be paid
          off by the purchaser�s price. That title defect won�t be cured until
          the purchaser�s price is obtained. But then again, the purchaser�s
          price is coming from
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">another</i> lender. The
          purchaser may have secured financing from a different bank which will
          be secured by a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">new </i>mortgage. Everything
          will be cleared up at the closing. It would be nutty to say that the
          vendor is in default because he hasn�t cleared his mortgage prior to
          closing. It makes sense to clear that mortgage with the proceeds that
          will come out of the closing.

          is another stalemate situation. But the purchaser doesn�t get his down

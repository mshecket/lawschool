        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Wheeler sued White because White allegedly breached a contract to
          finance construction on Wheeler�s land. In reliance on this contract,
          Wheeler knocked down some buildings on his land, after which the
          financing never came through. Wheeler said if the contract was
          uncertain, White should be barred from saying the contract was
          uncertain because of his actions which reasonably induced Wheeler to
          knock down the buildings. White said the contract was indeed too
          uncertain and that the doctrine of estoppel couldn�t create a ground
          for Wheeler to recover. The trial court dismissed Wheeler�s case and
          Wheeler appealed.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Does the doctrine of promissory estoppel bar White from claiming that
          the contract is void for vagueness since he induced Wheeler�s
          reliance?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          When a party acts to his detriment in reasonable reliance on an
          otherwise unenforceable promise and is injured, that party may have a
          claim for breach.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis: </span></b
        ><span
          >The court sort of sees this as a classic promissory estoppel case. If
          Wheeler can prove the facts as he alleges them, then he has a good
          claim against White. White was trying to influence Wheeler�s conduct
          by promising to get him financing. White actually did succeed in
          influencing Wheeler�s conduct. But then White backed out. The contract
          is no good, but promissory estoppel has the power to make stuff
          enforceable that is usually not enforceable.</span

        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b

          The dismissal is reversed and the case is remanded for trial.</span

            >It seems that the difference is in the side that brought the
            action. If Ball-Co. had brought suit against
            <span class="SpellE">Empro</span> on a promissory estoppel theory, I
            think they could have succeeded if
            <span class="SpellE">Empro</span> had told them outside the context
            of the letter that they were definitely going to buy Ball-Co. and
            thus it would not be necessary for them to negotiate with anyone
            else. In <i>Wheeler</i>, the plaintiff relied on the
            defendant.</span

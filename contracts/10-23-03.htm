            creditor lends you money today in exchange for the promise to repay
            with interest. Was that the situation here? The amount of the
            interest on the premium would have been tiny. Also, the creditor is
            not motivated by wanting to make a profit on loaning the premium
            payments. The creditor is making a threat to try to keep the car
            insured. Consideration is relatively thin here.</span

            Maybe, maybe not. One reason to be suspicious is that they are doing
            the same thing (inaction) as before the promise was made. Another
            reason to be suspicious is that they had no money and
            <i>couldn�t</i> pay the premium. They would have done the same thing
            whether or not the promise had been made. Also, the
            <span class="SpellE">Geremias</span> continue to drive the car. If
            they thought the car was uninsured, they might have chosen not to
            drive it around. Was their driving relying on the promise to pay the
            premium? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe they were just so dependant on
            driving the car that they decided to take their chances. Is there
            any real reliance here?</span

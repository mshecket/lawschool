plaintiff must prove: (1) contract formation, (2) breach, and (3) damages. Sometimes it's a good idea to break a

influences the incentives of a contract breaker or someone considering breaking
a promise. A unilateral contract is one
where only one party has made a promise. That is, a promise has been exchanged for performance. A bilateral contract is one where a promise
is exchanged for a promise. This is now

part of the way through the term of the breached contract? Damages are to be measured by the difference

<p><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span style='color:black'>Cover is an actual transaction
when a buyer aggrieved by a breach goes out on the market and buys something to
replace the thing they would have received under the contract. </span></i><span style='color:black'>The
buyer's right to cover is the equivalent of the seller's right to resell. § 2-712. After a breach, buyer may
&quot;cover&quot; by making honestly and quickly any reasonable
substitution. The buyer may recover the
difference between the cost of cover and the contract price plus incidental or
consequential damages minus expenses saved due to breach. If you don't cover,
you can get another remedy like § 2-713.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Reasonableness of cover is to be
judged at the time of the conduct; hindsight doesn't matter. &quot;Without unreasonable delay&quot; is not
intended to limit the time necessary for buyer to shop around. The cover purchase must be in substitution
for the defaulted contract goods. Cover
can include a series of purchases, even on the spot market, as long as they are
reasonable. Unreasonable cover (e.g. too
expensive) is not considered a cover. It's not fair to shift the cost of unreasonable cover to the contract
breaker.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>A buyer can have damages under §
2-712 or § 2-713 and still have extra damages from § 2-715. Incidental damages
resulting from the seller's breach include money spent getting ready to buy
goods rightfully rejected (like renting a van to pick up the stuff), reasonable
expenses of cover and anything else reasonable. Consequential damages resulting from breach include loss resulting from
requirements the seller had reason to know about that couldn't be prevented by
the buyer (like with cover). This is a
codification of the principle of mitigation/avoidable consequences. The possibility of cover limits consequential
damages. You can't get <i>specific

<p><i><span style='color:black'>Action for the price:</span></i><span
style='color:black'> Seller delivers, but buyer breaches. This contract is enforceable because the
goods were delivered. Seller has a claim
for the full contract price. § 2-709:
When the buyer breaches the seller can get incidental damages plus: the price
of goods accepted or lost or damaged after a commercially reasonable time after
the stuff has passed to the buyer (buyer has it, hasn't paid for it, but broke
it). There's also an action for the
price if the seller can't find somebody else who will buy the goods at a
reasonable price, e.g., customized goods. Where the seller sues for the price he must hold for the buyer any goods
still in his control except he may resell them before getting the judgment. The money you get from that resale has to be
credited to the buyer and if he pays the judgment he gets any goods not
resold. After the buyer has breached, a
seller who isn't allowed to get action for the price can get damages for breach
under § 2-706 or § 2-708. If the buyer
is found liable and does pay for the stuff, you generally have to give them the
stuff. It's rare that the seller needs
the <i>full</i> price.</span></p>

<p><i><span style='color:black'>Resale:</span></i><span

it. Buyer never picks up the goods and
never pays. Seller resells the goods for
less than she would have received from the buyer and below market price. Seller can't get the full price. § 2-706: If the seller resells the goods
honestly and quickly, the seller can get the contract price minus the resale
price plus incidental damages (§ 2-710) minus expenses saved by breach. Seller must (almost always) give the buyer
notice of intention to resell. This
section is analogous to § 2-712 (COVER) for a buyer's damages. § 2-706 (2) says that <i>every aspect of the
resale</i> must be commercially reasonable. If § 2-706 doesn't apply you go to § 2-708 (1). When the resale is private, the seller must
give the buyer reasonable notification. No notification leads to <span class=GramE>no</span> resale damages.</span></p>

bold'>The doctrine of anticipatory repudiation does not apply when it helps the
breaching party. You don't need to
mitigate damages until you have actually incurred those damages. </span>§ 2-610. When either party breaches
before the date of performance, the injured party may wait for the other party
to perform for a reasonable time, or get a remedy with § 2-703 or § 2-711 even
if they told the other party he would await the other's performance and has
urged retraction.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>§251 <span class=GramE>tells</span>
you if you have a repudiation. If you
believe that a breach is about to happen, you can demand assurance of
performance and suspend your performance until you're reassured. If you don't get reassured in a reasonable
time, you can treat it as <span class=GramE>a repudiation</span>. § 2-609: Between merchants the reasonableness
suspecting breach and whether the reassurance is believable is judged according
to commercial standards. After you get a
demand for reassurance, if you don't provide it in 30 days or some lesser
reasonable time, that's repudiation.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>According to § 2-723, when the
action comes to trial before the performance date, damages are determined by
the date when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation. In the more usual case, <i>however</i>, when
the case goes to trial after the date of performance, the damages are
calculated on the date of performance. Is this a conflict? Courts have
decided to stick with § 2-610 (a), and let you wait a commercially reasonable
amount of time.</span></p>

the replacement value of the goods and services provided by injured party. This is a case of <i>quasi-contract </i>recovery. You <i>don't recover the value conferred</i>;

<p><span style='color:black'>§ 2-718(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>b):
If you paid a down payment but then repudiated before the UCC, you would lose
your down payment. That was seen as the
purpose of a down payment. Under the
UCC, however, the seller has to give back the whole down payment except for
$500 or 20% of the contract price, whichever is smaller. When the buyer is in breach, the buyer is
entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his payments exceeds
twenty per cent of the value of the total performance for which the buyer is
obligated under the contract or $500, whichever is smaller. A buyer in default will not get restitution
to the extent that the seller suffers damages. This is a significant "ding" into the restitution interest when the
contract price is small, but it gets smaller and smaller as the contract price
goes up.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>If the buyer's breach actually
damages the seller, then we ding restitution in order to put the seller in the
position that performance would have done. You ding the restitution for the $500/20% and then you further ding it
for the seller's damages. You can find
this in § 2-718(3).</span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Whenever the compensatory damages
exceed the penal amount, you can usually predict that the penal damages aren't
going to get dinged. This is contrary to
the plain language of the statute, but courts just plain don't like it. When there are no compensatory damages or
small compensatory damages, they will impose the penal damages.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>§ 2-718(2) only applies when the
buyer has made a down payment and is coming into court as the plaintiff trying
to get it back. If the seller has
damages and chooses to come into court as a plaintiff, the buyer gets 100%
credit for the down payment. This

performance <i>free from serious defects</i>. Sometimes the standard of damages is "diminution of value" and sometimes
it's how much it would cost to fix the defects. Courts don't like to throw away existing valuable things. Sometimes diminution in value is smaller in
dollars than fix-up cost, but sometimes it's a lot more than fix-up cost. § 348.</span></p>

<p>If there is <i>some</i> loss, and the agreed upon damages

called a "penalty clause". A penalty
clause doesn't invalidate the entire contract; instead, you just pretend that
the clause was never there and enforce the rest of the contract. § 356: the parties to a contract cannot
create a <i>penalty </i>for its breach. As a matter of public policy and economic efficiency, penalties in
contracts have no purpose. This is
almost identical to UCC § 2-718(1); that It makes it a little easier to uphold

seller breaks their promise to sell you land, you can attempt to collect the
market price less the contract price. It
might be difficult, however, to prove the market price of the land. (2) Specific performance against the
seller. (3) Specific performance against
the third-party purchaser (the person who bought the land instead of you in
violation of your contract). (4) Sue the

sell for less than the agreed price without new consideration. Modifications must be made in good faith: §
1-203. You can't modify a contract with
extortion or coercion or duress. Besides,
when the only consideration for a promise is something you already owed, you

principle? § 2-207 hasn't worked as well
as was hoped.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Acceptance is used two different ways in the text of the
statute: (1) "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>expression</i> of
acceptance", that is, something that looks like an acceptance, and (2) "<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>operates</i> as an acceptance", that is,
having the legal effect of an acceptance. The deviant acceptance operates as an acceptance of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>offer</i> on the buyer's terms. If there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>different </i>term, that's taken care of in § 2-207 (2). The additional terms are going to be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>proposals </i>for additions to the
contract. Between merchants, the terms
become part of the contract except, among other <span class=GramE>things,</span>
the new terms materially alter the original offer. Note that the effect of an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>additional </i>term differs from the effect
of a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>different </i>term. Parties will focus more on the dickered terms
than on the boilerplate.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Sending an acknowledgement at a way different price sounds
like a counteroffer. You're not in §
2-207 (1) because it's not a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>definite</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>seasonable</i> expression of
acceptance. If the parties are far apart
on a significant term, they haven't reached agreement.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Idaho Power Co. v.
Westinghouse Electric Corp. </i>– UCC § 2-207 says that in commercial
transactions, the common law "mirror image" rule will not be used. Instead, a "deviant acceptance" is still
treated as an acceptance as long as it is not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>expressly</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>conditional</i> on
new and different terms.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How does the buyer defend against its purchase order being
an acceptance of the seller's terms? The
buyer tries to make use of the "unless" clause of § 2-207 (1). You can prevent an acceptance from being an
acceptance if you make it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>expressly </i>conditional
on the additional and different terms. That's a great defensive clause for the person with the responding
document. All responding documents will
contain this language in <b>ALL CAPS
BOLDFACE</b>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The "unless" clause in § 2-207 (1) is read in an extremely
restricted way. Notice that while §
2-207 (1) gives a great defensive opportunity to the party with the responding
document, § 2-207 (2) gives two such opportunities to the party that fires the
first shot: § 2-207 (2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) and (2)(c). The offer can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>explicitly limit acceptance to the terms of the offer</i> or can reject
the other person's new terms. It's
called the "battle of the forms" because both sides will tend to use outrageous
language.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When the seller's acknowledgement has a big difference in
price (for example), the seller's acknowledgement is treated as a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>counteroffer</i> and not a "definite and
seasonable expression of acceptance". There
is no contract at this point. But if the
buyer ships the goods and the seller accepts them, you may be able to treat
that as an acceptance of the seller's counteroffer.</p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p>Let's say the buyer has carefully "<span class=SpellE>lawyered</span>"
its form such that the purchase order makes use of the defensive opportunities
provided by § 2-207 (2<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) and (2)(c). It will do so with boldface, all-caps
language tracking the language of the statute. It will say that "l'>THIS PURCHASE
ORDER OFFER EXPRESSLY LIMITS ITS ACCEPTANCE TO THE TERMS OF THIS OFFER</b>" and
that "l'>THIS BUYER OBJECTS TO ANY TERMS
VARYING FROM ANY TERMS IN THIS OFFER.</b>" Additionally, the terms in the buyer's purchase order are strongly
pro-buyer. Among other things, the
seller is to provide <span class=GramE>a panoply</span> of warranties and no
limitation of liability. The seller
replies with a mirror image of the dickered terms. But the boilerplate expressly and
conspicuously disclaims warranties and limits liability. This form also uses the defensive "unless"
clause from § 2-207 (1). They'll do this
in all-caps and boldface. "<b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY MADE CONDITIONAL ON
ASENT TO ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT TERMS THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS.</b>"</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It's hard to find an offer and acceptance given all the
boldface, all-caps disclaimers. The
buyer has said that you have to accept <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all
our terms</i>, and the seller has said that they expressly <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>refuse </i>to accept the buyer's terms. What have we got? Do we have
offer and counteroffer? Are we back
where the common law has left us? Is
there another way out under § 2-207? Yes! A suggestion: how about
finding a contract when the seller's acknowledgement is dispatched? We could include terms upon which the two sides
coincide, and if the boilerplate differs, we'll disregard both and fill in gaps
with off-the-shelf provisions. We can do
it under § 2-207 (3).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The writings of the parties in this case don't seem to
establish a contract, but a lot of courts will follow the suggest that the
parties' conduct treating this as a made deal as soon as the acknowledgement is
dispatched and the product is shipped means that a contract is formed. The only problem is figuring out what the
terms are.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here's some jargon: we're going to have what's referred to
in the case law as the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knock-out rule</i>. Each party <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>knocks out</i> the other party's terms, and we're going to fill-in with
off-the-rack generic terms where necessary. What can the seller do? They can
put "COUNTEROFFER" in big letters when they respond to the purchase order. You could also instruct the seller not to
ship until they get the buyer to agree to their terms.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Prior course of dealing between parties will have a lot to
do with what the parties have agreed upon. This may have a big influence on just what terms are taken to be part of
the contract.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The new § 2-206 (3) codifies much of the current § 2-207,
but there's no grand defensive clause at the end. There's also a stylistic difference: the current
version has a lot of mechanical things that haven't worked well. The new version is much more general
principles rather than mechanical specifics.</p>

"as is"<span class=GramE>,</span> you have to really rub your customers' noses
in it. Parke-<span class=SpellE>Bernet</span>
would just as soon not do it that way because it would be sort of <span
class=SpellE>uncool</span> and <span class=SpellE>unchic</span>. But the appellate court reverses, pointing to
the warranty in the catalog. They also
say that this is an auction of old paintings, thus the painters aren't around
to ask whether they really painted the paintings. The best you can do is say: "We think the guy
painted these paintings." But nobody
knows for sure!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two ways to think about this case: (1) <span
class=GramE>There</span> was a flat out warranty that these paintings were
genuine, and then it was disclaimed. But
the better argument for Parke-<span class=SpellE>Bernet</span> was: (2) Of
course they didn't warrant they were genuine, and you, the buyer, should have
known that too. Everybody knows there
are a lot of forgeries going around and you can't be absolutely certain about
anything. Even without the condition of
sale, it ought to be a case decided for Parke-<span class=SpellE>Bernet</span>

<p>The big questions are: (1) <span class=GramE>When</span> was

terms of that contract? When a consumer
enters into a "deal now, terms later" deal, and the later terms don't

contracts in general. This is a case of
"deal now, terms later". Easterbrook
says there's nothing wrong with that, which is a controversial stance. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hill v.
Gateway 2000, Inc.</i> – In this case, it's not face-to-face, but rather done
by mail order. In both situations,
Easterbrook notes that a license pops up when you start using the software (<span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zeidenberg</i></span>) or
you see a license inside the packing box (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hill</i>). Easterbrook makes the terms inside the box
part of the deal.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It seems that contracts ought to be formed early on. There are arguments that acceptance occurred
at the store in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zeidenberg</i></span>
and over the phone in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hill</i>. This is sometimes called a "rolling
acceptance". One thing that will help
this be enforceable is the opportunity to return the goods within a certain
amount of time.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What does Article 2 have to say about this? Not much that will help Easterbrook. One approach in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Hill</i> situation is you have § 2-206. When people call in to buy goods over the phone or electronically,
they're typically forming a contract when they order. How do we get terms later? Another approach is found in § 2-209, where
you have a contract without these terms originally, but then the contract is
modified by agreement. The agreement
comes when the consumer fails to return the goods within 30 days.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Acceptance is effective when you put it in the mailbox. When you drop your acceptance in the mailbox,
a contract is created. Acceptance can be
effective on dispatch. But why is that
our law? It is a rare and different
thing that acceptance is effective on dispatch.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What if the acceptance is delayed or lost in the mail? That's a contract anyway. The offeror might have a problem with it, but
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>too bad</i>. Restatement § 63 says that we won't qualify
"acceptance effective on dispatch" for the sake of convenience. Even if the post office screws up and delays
or loses the acceptance, there will be a contract. Notice there is an exception for option
contracts (irrevocable offers). Acceptance (or exercise of the offer) is only effective on receipt. It need not be effective on dispatch when the
offeror is disabled from revoking.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison v. <span
class=SpellE>Thoelke</span> </i>– The court in this case says <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you can't repudiate your own acceptance</i>
after it's in the mail; the contract is created upon dispatch. Before the offeror knew that the acceptance
had been dispatched, they were told that the offerees had changed their
mind. The problem is that if we let the
offerees do that, it would let the offerees create their own, <span
class=SpellE>unbargained</span>-for, and thus unfair option contract. If you had the opposite rule, the <span
class=GramE>vendors <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>(</span><span
class=SpellE>offerors</span>) would have an <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unbargained</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>-for option</i>. But how
realistic, in business terms, is this risk of an <span class=SpellE>unbargained</span>-for
option? Is the rule all that justified
in this situation? It's debatable. The justification for the rule is a good deal
less clear then it is in the situation of the "crossing revocation and
acceptance".</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you put your acceptance in the mail and then revoke
before it arrives, your revocation operates as a repudiation of an existing
contract. On the other hand, if the
offeror doesn't want a contract possibly because the offeror relies on the
rejection that beats the already-dispatched acceptance, then the offeror <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>should not</i> be stuck with a contract
against the <span class=SpellE>offeror's</span> wishes. One way for the offeror to deal with that
would be to say that the offeree has accepted and then totally breached the
contract.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>§ 65 <span class=GramE>says</span> a medium of acceptance is
reasonable and thus invited by the offer if it is the same as the one used by
the offeror. To have a mailed acceptance
effective on dispatch, it must be properly addressed. If the address is messed up, the acceptance
will be effective on receipt, if it's ever received. The acceptance must also have correct postage
in order to be effective on dispatch. All fees for transit must also be paid. When you hand-deliver, the acceptance is technically in your possession
until it's received.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The thing is that we're trying to figure out if the
acceptance was done with a method invited by the seller. § 63 <span class=GramE>asks</span>: was this
medium of acceptance invited by the offer? If it was, then the mailbox rule is triggered and the acceptance is
effective on dispatch. When the offer is
made by mail, usually acceptance is invited by mail too. If the mailbox rule is negated because the
method of acceptance used was not invited, then the acceptance is effective on
receipt.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This rule governs the effect of a written agreement that
comes after prior oral or written agreements between two parties. In essence, if the last writing was intended

evidence of prior oral or written agreements.</p>

<p>The parol evidence rule <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>divides

and others would keep out huge amounts of such evidence. Williston was an example of a "conservative"
on this, while Corbin was an example of a "liberal" view on the rule. Corbin is more in the ascendancy right now,
but there's a little of both in every jurisdiction. Even within one person, no one is probably

true: (1) <span class=GramE>The</span> oral agreement must be collateral in
form. (2) The oral agreement must not
contradict any express or implied provisions of the written contract. (3) The oral agreement must not be of the
type the parties would ordinarily expect to put into writing. In other words, the written agreement on its
face mustn't appear to contain the complete agreement of the parties.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A contract is a promise or set of promises that the law will
enforce. But is the contract only the
writing, or the writing plus the oral promise? Why should we bar evidence of oral agreements? The courthouse door is open to liars, and
sometimes people win on the basis of lies. So part of what's going on is an attempt to screen out liars. Writings are pretty objective. Witness testimony is messy and expensive to
deal with. Another problem is that if
parol evidence is allowed, perjury might increase. But opinion after opinion denies that this is
the point. Another "virtue" of the rule
is that it favors the party with the writing, which is the economically
dominant party. Another justification is
that if there were no parol evidence rule, it would be very difficult to decide
any contract case on summary judgment. Efficiency pushes towards deciding cases on the basis of the writing.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Some people call this the "collateral agreement
exception". Collateral means "alongside,
related but separate, supplementary" and that kind of thing. So the first requirement is: (1) <span
class=GramE>The</span> agreement must be a collateral one in form. (2) The oral agreement mustn't contradict
express or implied provisions of the writing. If the writing looks like a complete agreement, then when you try to
supplement it you reach a contradiction. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>(3) The agreement must be one that the parties
would not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ordinarily</i> be expected to embody
in the writing. If they would ordinarily
put it in the writing, they better darn well put it in there or else it doesn't
count. The word "natural" is used. If the agreement had really been made,
Andrews says it would be "natural" to include the agreement in the writing.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>One reason we have this rule is to let judges keep the
testimony of liars away from juries. Judges will claim that credibility is a question for the jury, but in
fact they will use the rule to keep people away from juries.</p>

 style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stafford</i></st1:place><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>– Parol evidence can only be introduced
if: (1) the oral agreement was not inconsistent with the written agreement, and
(2) the oral agreement was such that it might "naturally" be made separately
from the written agreement "by parties situated as were parties to the written
contract". Even when both parties to a
contract have lawyers and sign elaborate agreements, there will always be
things that aren't expressed in the writing. The Corbin-type liberal position says that the writing is not given a
"magic", unique and compelling force. Instead, the court should concentrate on the intent of the parties. That's the intent of the Restatement, Second
and UCC § 2-202.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>§ 209 <span class=GramE>asks</span> if we have an integrated
agreement. <span class=GramE>An
integration</span> is a writing which <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>finally</i>
expresses at least one term of an agreement. § 213 <span class=GramE>provides</span> the parol evidence rule itself: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A binding integrated agreement discharges
prior agreements that are inconsistent with it</i>, because they have been <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>abandoned</i>. Those prior agreements are integrated into
the writing, and are therefore <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>irrelevant</i>. § 209 (2) says that whether you have an
integrated agreement is a question for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>judge
</i>and not the jury. The judge does
this before interpreting the writing (see § 212). Generally, interpretation is also a task for
the judge and not the jury. The judge
decides if we have an integration, decides what the written words mean, and
then the judge applies the parol evidence rule. If the agreement is integrated, it discharges prior inconsistent agreements. If the agreement is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>completely</i> integrated, prior agreements <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>within its scope</i> are discharged.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The parol evidence rule allows evidence to come to the
judge. The judge is able to hear
evidence out of the earshot of the jury. Then the judge can decide whether the testimony ought to be admitted or
not. The judge first decides if there's <span
class=GramE>an integration</span>, then interprets it, then decides whether we
have parol evidence inconsistent with the integration or within the scope of
that agreement. So if you were applying
the Restatement to the cases we've gone over, we would first ask the question:
Do we have integrations?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>§ 216 <span class=GramE>says</span> that evidence of a
consistent additional term is admissible to supplement an integrated agreement <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless</i> the court finds that the
agreement was completely integrated.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc67310828"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Two kinds of integrations</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There seem to be two kinds of integrations: a partial
integration and a complete integration. A <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>partial</i> integration is a
final expression of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i> of the terms
of the agreement, but not all of them. A
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>complete </i>integration is a final
expression of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> of the terms of the
agreement. Whether <span class=GramE>an
integration</span> is complete is a matter of the intention of the parties. A smart and artful judge can manipulate the
parol evidence rule as an instrumentality to screen out testimony the judge
doesn't believe or to speed a case through the system.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>One thing that might make an agreement completely integrated
is a clause that repeatedly appears in form agreements: "It is understood that
this contract contains all of the terms and conditions agreed upon between the
parties and that there are no outside agreements." This is called an integration or merger
agreement (or clause). It's designed to
make something a complete integration, but it will only work sometimes.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>§ 214 says that prior agreements and negotiations are
admissible (to the judge) to show whether or not a writing is an integration
and whether or not it's complete. This
is a pretty liberal, <span class=SpellE>Corbiny</span> approach with a big
interest in protecting the justifiable expectations of the parties.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In practice, you hear the phrase "the writing speaks for
itself" very often. This is sort of a <span
class=SpellE>Willistonly</span> phrase. You could translate this into Restatement Second/Corbin terms: you could
say that the contract was a complete integration, that the oral term is
inconsistent with the written agreement, the oral term is within the scope of
the written agreement, the oral term doesn't bear on the interpretation of the
written agreement, and the oral term would not naturally be omitted from the
writing. You can get this from
Restatement §§ 209-210 and 213-216. Usually,
though, a contract includes <span class=GramE>a writing</span> and some stuff
that's outside the writing. If you
believe the stuff outside the writing, you'll tend to consider it part of the
contract.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hayden v. <span
class=SpellE>Hoadley</span></i> – People often forget to put stuff in
agreements, and to fix that we have gap-filling provisions in the common law
and Article 2. For example, we might
read in the requirement to finish within a "reasonable time", or the
requirement to do the work in a "workmanlike manner". These gap-fillers help turn non-contracts
into contracts. But on the other hand,
these gap-fillers are usually only effective when there hasn't been an
agreement to the contrary.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Comment (b) for § 216 says that you have to consider the
consistency of additional oral terms in light of all the circumstances. The meaning of the writing includes not only
express terms, but also terms implied by the bargain of the parties in
fact. But we don't include gap-filling
rules that the parties didn't agree to.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>§ 2-202 is the source of much of what is in the Restatement
Second. It states the parol evidence
rule in a succinct way in one long, complicated sentence. The UCC says that the parol evidence rule
will exclude any agreement prior to the integrated agreement. However, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the
parol evidence rule in the UCC does not bar evidence of an agreement <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>subsequent</b> to the writing</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you're a disciple of Corbin, you'll want to read words in
a contract narrowly for the purpose of § 2-202, and if you're a follower of
Williston, you'll want to read them broadly. § 2-202 is a more liberal parol evidence rule than some of the preceding
common law stuff where you would keep out stuff that would "naturally" be
included in the writing. In the UCC, you
only keep out stuff that would "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>certainly</i>"
be included in the writing. The Code is
favorable to "course of performance", "course of dealing" and "usage of trade":
§ 1-205.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There is an exception to the exclusionary force of the parol
evidence rule for fraud. Check out § 214
(d): prior or contemporaneous agreements and negotiations are admissible to
show "illegality, fraud, duress, mistake, lack of consideration" or other
stuff. In particular, you can show that
you were induced to sign a contract by fraud. You can do one of two things: (1) <span class=GramE>You</span> could
rescind and do away with the transaction. Both parties will be able to back out. (2) You can sue for damages. Such
damages are measured either by the "out-of-pocket" rule or the "benefit of the
bargain" rule.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc67310830"><b

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Fraud is a tort. What
is the "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraud exception</i>"? The parol evidence rule is not going to block
you from proving fraud. Check out § 214
(d): You <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may </i>introduce evidence that,
among other things, a contract should be invalidated due to fraud. You could also introduce evidence that you
were <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>coerced</i> into signing, that there
was a lack of <span class=GramE>consideration, that</span> the contract was
illegal, or that contract terms were entered into by mistake.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The elements of the
tort of fraud: </i>There must be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>misrepresentation</i>
of a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>material fact</i> done with <span

reprehensible fault on the part of the liar as opposed to innocent
mistake). There must be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reliance</i> on the part of the victim. There must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>damage </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>loss</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you were induced to sign by fraud, then the writing can
be set aside and you can get damages in tort. On the other hand, sometimes the victim can simply rescind.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span class=GramE>A minority of jurisdictions have</span>
the "out of pocket" rule (similar to reliance damages), while a majority of
jurisdictions have "benefit of the bargain" rule (more like expectation
damages). The "benefit of the bargain"
is like the expectation interest and protects your profit if you can prove
it. The "out of pocket" rule tries to put
you back to "square one" as if the deal had never been made.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lipsit</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Leonard </i>– Can a tort action for
fraud be maintained even if enforcement of the contract on which it's based is
barred by the parol evidence rule? Under
<st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> law, the parol evidence
rule does not bar evidence of fraud inducing a written agreement when such
evidence is introduced in a tort action for money damages rather than an action
for breach of contract.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Making a promise and breaking it is not a misrepresentation
of a material fact, but making a promise with the intent to break it when you
make it and using it to induce service on the part of an employee could be a
valid suit on the theory of torts.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In a "benefit of the bargain" jurisdiction, you get <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>what you were promised</i> minus what you
got. Even so, in a "benefit of the
bargain" jurisdiction, you may have trouble proving what you were
promised. But you'll be able to try to
prove "out of pocket" loss even though you're theoretically entitled to more.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What can you do in draft a contract that could prevent fraud
by the other party? You can try to
negate one of the elements of the tort of fraud so there is no tort. Many people try to negate the element of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reliance</i>. There is a clause written into the contract
saying that one party does not rely on the statements of the other party.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>LaFazia</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Howe</i> – The writing that the parties
sign contain a non-reliance clause and a merger clause. The <span class=SpellE>Howes</span> tried to
prove fraud. They wanted to prove that
the sellers made fraudulent misrepresentations, but they're missing the element
of reliance. Various judges have
different feelings about reliance clauses. If you try to reconcile the cases on the basis of not only the doctrine,
but the facts, you'll find that in the cases where the non-reliance clause was
enforced, but also there was factually very little reliance in the case. The victim knew or ought to have known that
any representations about the manner in question weren't meant to be taken very
seriously.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The tort of fraud can be a way <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>around </i>the parol evidence rule. Or you can simply think about it this way: when you have the tort of
fraud, and when it's proved (sometimes beyond the preponderance of the evidence
and pleaded with particularity), you need to be compensated. You either should be allowed to rescind or
you should be able to get damages.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If something serious that ought to be relied upon had been
said and relied upon and there is a non-reliance clause in the writing, the
court may allow a tort claim to go forward. The court might say that the clause is "boilerplate" and
"non-specific". But in reality, the
court might really be drawing a line and saying that you can't perpetrate fraud
with impunity. But these are just <st1:City><st1:place>Clovis</st1:place></st1:City>'s
musings.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Another exception to the parol evidence rule is found in §
214 (e): parol evidence can be used to rescind or reform contracts. Evidence can be admitted under § 214 (d) to claim
that there is an invalidating clause, or under § 214 (e) there could be
evidence introduced tending to show that there was no meeting of the minds,

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hoffman v. Chapman </i>–
The parol evidence rule does not bar a claim in reformation. A court will reform <span class=GramE>a
writing</span> when there is evidence by clear and convincing evidence that a
"mutual mistake was made…contrary to their agreement". The idea is that when we have a mistake in
integration (like a slip of the pen or the wrong keystroke), under appropriate
circumstances we will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reform</i> (fix)
the writing to make it reflect the underlying agreement that has been reached. This case tells you that "<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equity aids the vigilant</i>".</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Several safeguards are built into the doctrine: (1) <span
class=GramE>We</span> have a higher standard of proof for a reformation case
than for other civil cases. For
reformation, the most common standard is "clear and convincing evidence" (somewhere
between the "preponderance" and "reasonable doubt" standards). (2) This is an equitable doctrine applied
solely by the judge. Some suits are
entirely about reformation, whereas other suits seek damages, specific
performance and other stuff and reformation is one issue along the way. If the claim is mostly an action at law with
a little bit of a suit in equity, the judge will look at the reformation
outside the presence of the jury and fix it or not.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If there was an underlying agreement, but the parties
changed it and came up with a final written agreement, then this doctrine
doesn't bar reformation, but the parol evidence rule might make it harder to
prove that the parties had some different underlying agreement.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In order to have a reformation case, the mistake must be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mutual</i> (shared in by both parties). We can say this because the person who wrote
the deed is considered an agent for both parties.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What if the mistake is unilateral? Many courts state that you can't reform in
the case of unilateral mistake. You may
be able to rescind and back out of the contract, but you can't reform. But when the court wants to reform the
contract, they'll find some way in which the mistake was mutual in order to get
to the result they want. <st1:City><st1:place>Clovis</st1:place></st1:City>
claims that we won't find a case that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>holds</i>
that a reformation will not be made due to unilateral mistake. He says to be leery of the statement that
"mistakes must be mutual in order to reform a contract".</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If there is no objective mutual assent and no subjective
mutual assent, we simply rescind the writing because there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>is no</i> underlying agreement. We must be able to distinguish these kinds of mistakes. Sometimes the distinction can involve some
subtleties and difficulties. There's a
difference between a failure of communication mistake and a mistake of
integration.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Some people, led by Williston, are reluctant to admit
extrinsic evidence with respect to the interpretation of writings. The "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>four
corners</i>" rule says that you ought to be able to interpret the words that
are there just by looking at the piece of paper and reading. It is supposed that a judge can read a
writing carefully just as well as anybody else or better. Another way to look at it is that if you sign
a paper that has a relatively clear meaning, you ought to be held to that. The standard, dictionary meaning of <span
class=GramE>a writing</span> is said to be the most reasonable. This is called the "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>plain meaning rule</i>" approach. This approach allows the resolution of many disputes on summary judgment
and makes for more efficiency and less litigation. Interpreting <span class=GramE>a writing</span>
is also something that an appellate court can do just as easily as a trial
court. That makes it appropriate in many
cases for an appellate court to reverse, which lets us develop precedent as to
what certain words mean.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pacific Gas &amp;
Elec. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage &amp; Rigging Co. </i>– Here we see the more
liberal approach: we'll always admit evidence for the purpose of interpreting <span

words don't just have one meaning, but rather have a context in which they are
used. This approach has virtues, but is
less efficient and may reward liars.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In § 214, we find that parol evidence is admissible to
establish the meaning of a writing. In §
212, the comment says that we can make an effort to figure out what the parties
really meant even if the words seem clear on their face. This makes litigation more complicated and
expensive sometimes. It creates more
uncertainty. It bothers people who write
their agreement in plain English and who want it enforced just as it looks.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In UCC § 2-202, it is stated in the comments that words are
to be understood in their commercial context and not merely through rules of
law. You can use words in a
non-dictionary way, and people do it all the time, including commercial
people. One of the underlying biases of
the UCC is that idea that we ought to interpret agreements and enforce them in
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>commercial</i> way. The people who made the deals should have the
deal they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>thought</i> they made

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This doctrine is intended to keep kids from getting taken
advantage of by adults. This is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se</i> rule. Restatement § 14 says that infancy lasts
until the beginning of the day before a person's 18<sup>th</sup> birthday. We are protecting the immature from the
consequences of their own immaturity. This doctrine makes the minor's promise <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>voidable</i>. The minor can
enforce the return promise from the adult if that's advantageous. The minor can walk away from the contract if
that's advantageous. However, as a
result, people won't want to make deals with minors! <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Halbman</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Lemke </i>–
When a minor disaffirms a contract, the minor has the duty to return to the
vendor as much of the consideration for the contract that he still has.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>One of the exceptions to this doctrine in most places is misrepresentation
of age by the minor. That's a tort. If you lie and say you're an adult when
you're not and the lie is deceiving, that is, the adult on the other side is
conned by <span class=GramE>it, that</span> can take away or qualify your right
to disaffirm your contract. There is
also the doctrine of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>necessities</i>. If you supply something that is necessary to
the minor, you may be able to enforce a contract against that minor depending
on how you define "necessity". When you
get right down to it, this doctrine doesn't cover a whole lot. It may cover emancipated minors, such as
those who are married.</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The doctrine of mental incompetence – § 15</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When will mental incompetence on the part of one of the
parties allow that party to void the deal? You can tell whether a person was competent when they made a contract
partly on the basis of whether the contract was fair. The vast majority of mental incompetence
cases involve older people losing mental capacity. It can be very difficult to figure out
whether someone was competent to contract in a particular situation at a
particular time.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Faber v. Sweet Style
Mfg. Corp.</i> – Sometimes the nature of the deal itself is so strange, unfair,
or unbalanced that the only way it can be explained is that one of the parties
is off their rocker. If there was
nothing inherently nutty about the deal, you look at the behavior of the person
who is claimed to be incompetent. The
finder of fact makes judgments about that person's behavior.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What if we were to apply § 15? The first test is whether you understand what
you're doing. Under § 15 (1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>a), a manic-depressive person would never be found
incompetent because they would always understand their actions. A reform is to add another section, § 15
(1)(b), which asks whether he is unable to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>act</i>
in a reasonable matter such that the other party has reason to know of his
condition.</p>

the party on the other side didn't do anything wrong. Either judgment here makes a certain amount
of sense. It makes sense for Mrs. <span
class=SpellE>Ortelere</span> to make a choice and normally we want those
choices to stick. It appears that <span

party. One party has considerable
strength, and the other party has some weakened capacity to resist. The <span class=SpellE>servient</span> party
might be an older person in some cases. They may have some capacity if they're not under pressure, but if you
compound the difficulties of old age with excessive pressure, you're on the way
toward making an undue influence case. When
you have pressure that is "coercive in nature" and "overcomes the will without
convincing the judgment", you'll have undue influence. This is a doctrine with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Duress involves <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>improper,
wrongful pressure</i> of some sort which <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actually
has the effect of coercion</i>. It's a
rougher situation than undue influence, and has harder edges. We need to figure out whether what is
threatened in a duress case is proper or improper and, assuming it's improper,
we need to find out whether that threat <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actually</i>
coerced someone to do something.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The applicable sections of the Restatement are §§
174-176. It starts out with a very basic
rule at § 174 that says that if you were <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>physically</i>
coerced into an agreement, your assent is ineffective under those
circumstances. At § 175, we get to a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>threat</i>. The threat can be coercive and highly improper. Cases of physical coercion or coercion by
threat are clear, and thus we don't have to worry about them that much.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Austin Instrument,
Inc. v. Loral Corp. </i>– This is a case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>economic
</i>duress. Was Loral forced to agree to
the price increases under circumstances that amount to economic duress as a
matter of law? "A contract is voidable
on the ground of duress when it is established that the party making the claim
was forced to agree to it by means of a wrongful threat precluding the exercise
of his free will."</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Not all threats to break a contract will result in economic
duress because remedies are available in the courthouse for breach of
contract. Thus, the threat doesn't
coerce when the remedy in the courthouse is effective. There is a free choice between sweetening the
pot and seeking a remedy in the courthouse.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The editors suggest at the beginning of this section that in
contracts there are frequently adjustments after they are made. Many of those adjustments are commercially
sensible and ought to be upheld. The
adjustments are made under the influence of pressure, just like the originally
agreements. Some degree of pressure is
appropriate. Duress will undo relatively
few deals.</p>

Marlton Corp. </i>– The vendor makes an agreement to sell a lot to be improved
by a house and the vendor is both selling lots and building houses on
them. The purchasers take the position
that the vendor is in default because the vendor has refused to go through with
the deal because they sold the house to someone else. The vendor avoids being in default because it
says that their failure to perform was compelled by duress. How did the purchasers coerce the vendor into
failing to perform? They threatened to
buy the house and then resell it to someone "undesirable", which was a
euphemism for "black" at the time. The
court says that you can make a duress case out of this.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Holmes said: "When it comes to the question of obtaining a
contract by threats, it does not follow that, because you cannot be made to
answer for the act, you may use the threat." You can frequently test whether a threat is proper or improper by
whether the person making the threat has the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>right</i> to do it. The threat
to sue is a proper threat <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless</i> you
do it in bad faith. You'll find this in
§ 176. On the other hand, the threat of
a criminal action in order to obtain an advantage on a contract is <i

deal. There is no problem of

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>An accord is an agreement between the parties to the
original contract where one side promises to excuse the other's original
performance in exchange for the promise of some other substituted performance. Satisfaction is when that substituted
performance is completed. UCC § 3-311
(a) gives some conditions under which accord and satisfaction can kick in.</p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>What about when there is a full payment check tendered to
satisfy an unliquidated debt? That will
be effective to kill the debt. There are
three factors required: (1) Good faith tender of an instrument to satisfy the
claim in full, (2) an unliquidated claim or one subject to good faith dispute,
and (3) the instrument is cashed.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But what if the words "payment in full" <span class=GramE>are</span>
scratched out and the words "payment on account" are written? What will happen when the creditor sues? The creditor loses. We like having the debtor be able to tender
these "paid in full" checks. What is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>said</i> is overridden by what is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>done</i>. When you accept an offer with your actions, we're not going to pay
attention to your protestations in words.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Most courts thought UCC § 1-207 was never intended to apply
to accord and satisfaction, but other courts "screwed it up" according to <st1:City><st1:place>Clovis</st1:place></st1:City>,
such as <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. When the amendment to § 1-207 was adopted in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
in 1994, the 1989 Ohio Supreme Court ruling was overturned. So you can't scratch out "paid in full" and
write "under protest" or anything like that anymore when we're talking about an
accord and satisfaction. However, you
can use language like this to reserve your right to sue down the line on other
matters.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A more mechanical way to deal with full payment checks is
found in § 3-311 (c), which provides some help for creditors
("organizations"). The creditor can send
a conspicuous notice that any disputes about debts must be sent to a particular
location (such as a P.O. <span class=GramE>box</span>). Another approach an organization can take is
found in § 3-311 (c<span class=GramE>)(</span>2). If you prove that you return the payment
within 90 days once you realize it's not really full payment, you can pursue
the debtor for the full amount. But all
of subsection (c) is subject to subsection (d). Subsection (d) says that the claim will be discharged if, more or less, the
creditor has no actual knowledge that the debtor is going to try to tender a
check in full satisfaction of the claim.</p>

<p>When there is a confidential relationship and the

you can put it together, and you have a constructive fraud case. You don't have a constructive fraud case
against an outsider or anyone dealing at arm's length, because there is no

an offer by the plaintiff to return the purchase price and rescind the
contract, and (5) the rejection of the defendant of that offer. One lesson of this case is that you can get
relief even when you've been a little careless. Negligence doesn't necessarily bar you from relief in cases like this. In this case, the court tries as best it can
to back the parties out of the situation and put both sides in their

<p>The law of mutual mistake: a useful way to think about it is
that when parties make an agreement, some risks are good and others are bad,

those shifted risks comes to pass.</p>

contract on the basis that the parties didn't know the cow was fertile when
they entered into the contract? A
contract may be rescinded if it was made in reliance upon a mutual mistake of
fact. In this case, the sellers are
successful in avoiding the contract even though there is no confidential
relationship between the buyer and the seller.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Why should we void a transaction on the basis of mutual
mistake? We're looking for mutual
mistake in regard to a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>basic underlying
assumption</i>. Sometimes we'll give
relief to a party that's disadvantaged by a mistake. But what are the costs upon the party that
would be advantaged by the mistake? We
want promises enforced when they are made because we want people to be able to
rely on them, so we unwind very few promises.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We will probably roll back this bargain because our intent
is to protect the expectation interest, and in this case, the buyer is going to
get an unearned, <span class=SpellE>unbargained</span>-for windfall if the
contract is not rolled back. We will
allow avoidance <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if and only if</i> the
buyer can be backed out of the situation. The seller can avoid if he gives the buyer his money back and
compensates the buyer for any reasonable reliance he had on the deal. You try to put both parties back to their
pre-contract positions. Sometimes it's
too late to put the parties back in their original position. Also, the power of avoidance is typically
limited in time, and you can lose it by not exercising it in a timely fashion
by letting the other party rely in some way that prejudices the other party.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Everybody makes mistakes, so we'll give you relief even if
you were careless, § 157. Your fault in
being careless won't bar you from a suit unless your fault was particularly
egregious. When you make a mistake, the

– This is a case of unilateral mistake, § 153. When you have a mutual mistake, one in which the parties share, that
tends to make avoidance of the contract easier. When you have a non-mistaken party and the mistaken party wants out of
the contract, we may be slow to let them out because we want to preserve the
stability of contracts and the protection of the expectation interest of the
non-mistaken part. When are we going to
unwind for a unilateral mistake? <st1:place><span

is one of the big sources for § 153 of the Restatement Second. If one party makes a mistake and the other
party has reason to know of the mistake, then the mistaken party can get off
the hook. See § 153 (b). On the other hand, if you're just lazy and
someone takes advantage of your laziness, you won't be entitled to get out of
the contract later. Conscious ignorance
is not the same as mistake. We will
rarely, if ever, avoid a contract on the basis of a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We'll mostly likely have relief and avoidance when mistakes are
clerical, mechanical, and dumb-headed. Such
a contract is voidable by the party to whom the mistake is adverse. We'll also grant relief if the benefiting
party had reason to know of the mistake. When the mistake is particularly egregious, the other party may well
have reason to know a mistake has been made. You can't snap up an offer that's too good to be true.</p>

remedy for breach of warranty is simply rescission. So both mutual mistake and breach of warranty
can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>potentially </i>lead to the same
remedy. That's one lesson from the case.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tribe v. Peterson </i>–
In order for a seller to make an express warranty, they must make a statement
of fact that relates to the goods and becomes part of the bargain.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A standard word of description in different contexts can
mean different things. One helpful index
to what the seller has agreed to sell is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>price</i>. That will tell us a good deal about what the
words of description mean.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Does the UCC take away the chance to argue mistake in a
warranty situation? Should we ever let
the seller off the hook on the grounds of mutual mistake, limiting the buyer to
a rescission and avoidance remedy rather than protecting the buyer's
expectation interest? The answer depends
on putting together § 1-103 with §§ 2-313 and 2-714(2). § 1-103 "grandfathers" in common law
principles, including mistake. But do
the provisions of §§ 2-313 and 2-714(2) displace the law of mistake, or do we
allow the law of mistake to supplement those provisions? Not every court will apply the statutes the
same way, but a number of courts would allow the law of mistake to supplement
if the seller is especially sympathetic. Once in a while, though not often, a seller in a warranty case can
obtain some relief by using a mistake argument defensively.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Notice that whether we have a § 2-313 warranty turns on
whether the description, affirmation of fact, promise, sample or model becomes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>part of the basis of the bargain</i>. Mutual mistake turns on the finding of an
untrue <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>underlying basic assumption</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But how do we figure out what the basis of the bargain
is? That's just as hard as finding out
what the parties' basic assumptions were.</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>– Both parties are excused because the
contract became impossible to perform. This
only happens when neither party is at fault. Before this case, the law said: "If you promise, you ought to perform,
and if you don't, you're going to pay damages. This law is not too harsh because you should have thought about this
when you entered into the agreement. You
should have conditioned your promise." <st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Taylor</i></st1:place></st1:City> grants
an excuse even when you don't have a death, illness, or blindness, but rather
the destruction of an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>asset</i> essential
to the performance of the contract.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>To get an excuse under § 261, your performance must be
rendered <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>impracticable</i>. Notice that § 261 ends with the words:
"unless the language or the circumstances indicate the contrary". An employee's death will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>typically</i> be "the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of
which renders performance impossible". But the employee <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could</i> promise
that in the case of his death the employer will be compensated. So you get an excuse in a personal services
contract if you die or if you get sick enough that you can't work. The sickness excuse may not be a total excuse:
it's only temporary, and when you get better, you probably have to go back.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Who's got the risk? When you make a promise, you typically have to keep it, even when doing
it becomes more troublesome and expensive than you previously anticipated. But there are some troubles that are so great
and so surprising that we'll say that the <span class=GramE>risk of such events
were</span> not assumed. So granting an
excuse is good for the person excused, but it's bad for the person on whom the
excuse operates.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tompkins v. Dudley</i>
– A builder almost finishes building a new school, but then it burns down. The builder says that he ought to get an
excuse, but the court says no and says that he must build it over again, at
which point he'll get paid <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>once</i> even
though he built it twice. One way to
explain this result is precedent. There
is authority for saying that we'll put the risk on the builder. Just like mutual mistake and identifying the
underlying basic assumptions, there are hard issues here.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Keep in mind two things: (1) <span class=GramE>The</span>
parties could have just contracted to say what would happen in the case of
unlikely events. (2) There's something
to be said for predictable precedents when we're dealing with unpredictably
destructive events. Having predictable
rules also makes it easier to contract out of them. The parties can choose to shift the loss to
an insurance company.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The builder promises to create an asset. The creator of the asset bears the risks of loss. The builder is not excused, and so the
builder is in breach when the builder refuses to rebuild. Therefore, the builder must put the owner in
the position that performance would have done.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Primarily, this rule is based on precedent. But if you want to, you could contract out of
this "off-the-rack", default rule. More
importantly, the builder can buy insurance against the risk of loss and then
include the cost of such insurance in the price to the owner. So this rule may not be the <span
class=GramE>world's</span> best, but you can contract out of it or insure
against it. One virtue of this rule,
however, is that it's clear and offers predictable results.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Carroll v. <span
class=SpellE>Bowersock</span> </i>– If what is lost in the fire has been <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>wrought into (or out of) the structure</i>,
then it's a benefit to the owner and the builder can recover for it. If it hasn't been wrought into the structure,
then the builder cannot recover for it. Materials sitting around the site and not yet wrought into the structure
in any way can be lost entirely at the builder's risk. In order for the builder to get restitution,
the owner must get a benefit, and there is no benefit until the builder has
made something a part of the building. One reason for this rule is that the court is spreading the loss
around. The loss is split between owner
and builder based on how much value is wrought into the structure.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>These are relatively common situations where you have
unforeseen circumstances that occur after contract formation but before
performance: § 2-613: When goods suffer "casualty" (like theft or fire) without
the fault of either party after a contract for their sale, and the bargain was
for these particular "identified" goods, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and
</i>the loss is total, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>then</i> the
contract is avoided. The consumer
doesn't have to pay the dealer, and if she had made a down payment she doesn't
have to get it back. Also, the dealer
need not deliver a car to the consumer, even if the consumer got a good deal.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The risk of loss doesn't pass to the consumer until the
consumer receives the car. When the
seller is a merchant, the risk of loss passes to the buyer upon receipt of the
goods.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>UCC § 2-615 says that even though the seller might not get a
complete excuse, the seller might get a partial excuse for delay in
delivery. Maybe the seller can get a
refrigerator from a different source. But
the buyer was entitled to have the contract performed. If the buyer gets notice that the seller will
be late, the buyer can call it quits and decide to deal with someone else. Alternatively, the buyer can agree to a later
delivery date and hold the seller to the agreed price and get it at a
reasonable later time. But we won't cram
something down the buyer's throat to which the buyer didn't agree.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>With goods, the seller has the risk until the goods are
received by the buyer. On the other
hand, with land, the starting place is the equitable conversion doctrine which
says that the purchaser has equitable title and bears the risk from the very
moment of contract formation. So you
better have insurance at the moment that you sign the contract! Or you can contract out of this. This rule is avoided by contract in pretty
much every land contract with which any kind of a professional has
contact. The only time it probably won't
get contracted out is when two amateurs make a homemade contract without being
aware of the rule.</p>

two bases: (1) <span class=GramE>It</span> was a <st1:place>Suez Canal</st1:place>
contract which became impossible to perform when the canal was closed. (2) Assuming it wasn't a <st1:place>Suez
 Canal</st1:place> contract, there was, nonetheless, a supervening event that
makes it impracticable to perform the contract, and thus the contract is
avoided. Nonetheless, it is claimed that
this carrier is not giving away its service in transporting the oil. The shipper wants to be paid on a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quantum <span class=SpellE>meruit</span></i>
basis just what their services rendered were worth. It's like when you go to the barber and sit

<p>Consider UCC § 2-615 and its comments. If you can see that a difficulty may increase
the cost and expense of performing a contract, what should you do? You ought to qualify your promise so that you
have an out if the difficulty materializes. Part of how we decide whether to let the promisor off the hook is
whether or not the supervening circumstance is really surprising.</p>

– In industries where there are frequent strikes, contracts for the sale of
goods can be reasonably read to include the intention to perform whether or not
there is a strike. However, if you're in
a line of trade where there has never been a strike or there hasn't been one
for many years, then the occurrence of a strike might grant you an excuse even
absent an express "out" in your contract.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When you're representing somebody, think about whether it is
wise to qualify your promises. If you
qualify your promises too much, you'll turn off the other party and you might
fail to come to an agreement. Your
ability to qualify your promises is limited by the bargaining situation.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Maple Farms, Inc. v.
City School Dist. </i>– These are commercial contracts for the sale of a lot of
goods over a significant period of time at fixed prices. The purpose of this kind of contract is to
shift the risk of the market. The buyer
wants to assure that it will get the named goods at the price specified in the
contract, and the seller wants to assure that it will get the named price for
the goods. This is understood as a
risk-shifting agreement.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If the parties don't want to shift risk, they can enter into
things like open-price agreements. If
they choose not to do that, we should be slow to grant an excuse because we
figure the parties knew what they were doing.</p>

<p>What's the historical background of unconscionability? A "hard" or unconscionable bargain will not
be enforced. We started out with this
idea on the equity side and not on the law side. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Unconscionability

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Horsley</i> – Was the bargain made so
unconscionable that specific performance should not be granted to the
plaintiff? A court sitting in equity should
not grant specific performance of a contract that is unjust under the
circumstances, including cases of fraud, mistake, and undue advantage.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This court is sitting in equity! The plaintiff seeks specific
performance! That means the court is
given the chance to think about what's fair. The judge has the change to say that "this deal stinks, and I refuse to
enforce it". The judge doesn't rescind
the contract here, but rather refuses performance in equity. The judge forces a jury to do the dirty work
in this dirty case.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The court of equity could deny specific performance, then
haul off and award huge money damages on the basis of the proof. This is the "cleanup principle": the court of
equity might retain jurisdiction over the suit for the purposes of awarding
damages. When the court of equity stays
its hand in one of these cases, it is likely to be a total victory or total
defeat. Maybe the court of equity is
kidding itself when it says: "No relief in equity, but you can always sue at
law" when as a practical matter you can almost never sue successfully at
law. Maybe it would be better if they
just put the contract to an end both at law and in equity. But in the law, we often operate in terms of
fictions and mysteries, and that's not all bad. But that's what we have in this situation.</p>

<p>Something is unconscionable when it would shock the

step toward determining that something is unconscionable. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
opposing party will have a chance to show that this provision isn't really that
bad of an idea.</i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Unconscionability is a question for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>judge</i> and not the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>jury</i>. The provision deals with whether the
provision was unconscionable <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at the time
of contract formation</i>. If bad things
happen later, we may give some relief, but we will give it under some other
doctrine. Under certain circumstances,
the court will disregard what the parties did and will either declare that they
made no contract or the court will fix up the agreement in some way that the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>judge</i> thinks is conscionable. The court has flexibility and either can
refuse to enforce the whole contract, or can decide to cut out a "cancer of
unconscionability" and leave the rest of it. Or the court can limit the application of particular clauses in order to
avoid an unconscionable result.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The parties get to present evidence to the court as to
whether the contract really was unconscionable at formation. There is both a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>visceral</i> and an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intellectual</i>
element. The court may not <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>like</i> the contract, but you have to let
the other side come in, often with economic evidence, that tends to show that a
certain provision is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>necessary </i>for
some reason. The proponent of the
provision as written will often come forward with a lot of testimony like
this. Litigation on this matter is
likely to be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>complicated</i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>difficult</i>, and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

try to put the agreement in an economic context.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The definition of "unconscionable" is deliberately excluded
from the statute. One-sidedness <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may </i>be related to
unconscionability. There is a threshold
of "one-sidedness" that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>will</i> make an
agreement unconscionable.</p>

<p>However, the fact that a bargain is one-sided doesn't make
an agreement unconscionable. The
principle is the avoidance of "oppression" and "unfair surprise". Notice that we don't want to disturb the
allocation of risks due to superior bargaining power. If you have superior bargaining power, you
can use it to allocate risks to the party with inferior bargaining power, <i

it. It's permissible to use your
bargaining power up to a certain limit, but not beyond that limit.</p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>Sometimes the unconscionability comes in because the price

on the part of the stronger party, (4) gross disparity in consideration, (5)
evidence that the stronger party knowingly took advantage of the weaker party,

this vocabulary and learn the consequences of deciding that something is a <i

the work you want, but a promise won't help. Sometimes a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>promise</i> will do
the work you want, but a condition won't help. Also notice that it's rare for a provision to be found to be a <i

  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gardner</i></st1:place></st1:City> – Did
the defendants really have the burden of proof? The promisor has the burden of proof to show that a certain condition
occurred that would let him off the hook by the terms of the contract. Historically, this distinction made a
difference as to burden of proof. A
condition precedent would have to be proved by the plaintiff. A condition precedent "switches on" the
defendant's promise. However, if it is a
condition subsequent that excuses the defendant from an otherwise existing
duty, then it's the defendant's burden to prove it. <span class=SpellE>Wigmore</span> called the
burden of proof "the risk of non-persuasion". In cases where the evidence is cloudy or precisely balanced or scanty,
the party with the risk of non-persuasion will lose. Whoever has the burden loses in such a case
because they can't carry the burden! The
allocation of burden of proof is result-determinative when the evidence is
cloudy, evenly balanced, or slim.</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. </i><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
 normal'>Preston</i></st1:place> – In a bilateral contract, one party's
performance is a constructive condition to the other party's subsequent duties. Lord Mansfield says there are three kinds of
covenants (promises): (1) Mutual and independent promises – either party may
recover damages from the other for a breach. It's not a defense that the other party didn't perform their part of the
bargain. (2) Dependent promises – the
performance of one promise is dependent upon the performance of another. (3) Mutual conditions to be performed at the
same time – if one party was ready to perform but the other party refuses then
the one who was ready has done their duty and the other side needs to do
theirs. These are known as either <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>concurrent</i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>constructive</i>, or conditions <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>precedent</i>. And this is generally what we've got with a
bilateral contract!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Often, we will think about the order in which the
transaction is going to go. The
transaction might require one side to go first. In other cases, it might be possible for both sides to move simultaneously. When tender of payment is a condition to the
seller's duty to tender delivery of the goods, and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>both</i> parties stay home, then neither party can collect damages from
the other party.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Lord Mansfield approach is that we won't make people
extend credit against their will, and we won't make them extend <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>more</i> credit than they would like against
their will. Nobody ought to have to
extend credit to anybody else unless he or she has agreed to do so! Lord Mansfield's idea of concurrent
conditions working out in a sale-of-goods context is codified at § 2-507 and §
2-511. § 2-507(1) says that the seller
has to tender deliver of the goods before the buyer incurs the duty to
pay. Under § 2-511, tender of payment is
a condition to the seller's duty to tender delivery of the good.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Sometimes we have a stalemate! <span class=GramE>Neither party is in
default, and</span> neither party can get into the other's pocket to recover
damages. Neither party <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deserves</i> to recover damages, because
neither "came out of his hole" and offered performance. On the other hand, neither party <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deserves </i>to be held liable in damages
because neither party was offered the exchange performance. Neither party's non-performance is
reprehensible enough to deserve a remedy in damages. </p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Consider what's happening in terms of Williston's writings:
it's possible under a bilateral contract to have a stalemate where neither
party is in default. In our legal
system, however, it is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>impossible</i> to
have a situation where <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> parties
are in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>total breach</i>. If your analysis comes out that way, you must
have screwed something up. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Both parties can be in no breach at all, but
both parties cannot be in total breach</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What puts the buyer in default? If the buyer doesn't show up, but the seller
shows up ready and willing to perform, then the buyer is in default. The seller will be in default if the buyer
shows up willing and able to tender the cash, but the seller doesn't show up.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cohen v. <span

just trying to get out of a bad deal. If
you do so, you'll run the risk that you'll be the party in breach and you'll be
liable for damages.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In order for the vendor to be able to sue the purchaser, the
vendor would have to tender the deed to the property. That switches on the purchaser's duty and
puts the purchaser in breach if she doesn't tender her payment and her
signature. But even if tender is
excused, the vendor must show that he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could
have</i> performed. If the vendor was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unable to perform</i>, because, for example,
the vendor had incurable title defects, then the idea is that the vendor
doesn't deserve to recover damages even though the purchaser repudiated. The repudiation must be the "but-for" cause
of the vendor's non-tender of performance.</p>

We have already seen some of <st1:City><st1:place>Mansfield</st1:place></st1:City>'s
ideas that we should do what we can to minimize the extension of credit. To the extent that the transaction doesn't
require the extension of credit, it shouldn't be there. But when on the terms of the contract it's
impossible for all of the performances to occur at the same time when the deal
was made, the vendor is extending credit to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>somebody</i>. The parties could have contracted into whatever
they wanted, but they didn't.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stewart v. Newbury</i>
– This is another "who's-in-default" case. This is a construction (services) contract. In the absence of some other express
provision, substantial performance is required before payment can be demanded. That's the constructive condition or
off-the-rack rule here! When you have a
performance on one side that takes time in exchange for a performance on the
other side that can be performed in an instant (like paying money), the
constructive order of performance is that the performance that takes time goes
first. Only when that performance is
completed is the obligation to pay triggered.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Recall that substantial performance means "meets the
essential purposes of the contract". It's a practical test and what it means in particular circumstances can
vary and be fuzzy. But nothing
half-finished or less will constitute substantial performance. Substantial performance is based in part on
the fact that construction of a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perfect
building</i> is impossible. If you meet
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>essential</i> purposes of the
contract, that will trigger the owner's duty to pay the price. The owner is entitled to all of the plans and
specifications, and thus can recover any damages suffered by any small
shortfall between the actual performance rendered and what was promised.</p>

must deliver <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all </i>the brick before the

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc67310852"><b

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Is this contract divisible? Check out § 240: if you can pair up performances in pairs that
correspond, one party's performance of half of each pair has the same effect as
if the contract only consisted of that one pair of performances. Most contracts aren't divisible. Most are "entire", which is the opposite of
divisible. In most contracts, you can't
divide them up into agreed equivalents. Take, for example, a standard construction contract. The basic agreement is to build a certain
building according to certain plans. The
owner's promise is to pay some contract price. Generally, by agreement, there will be progress payments. Otherwise, there will be too much credit
extended by the builder to the owner. The stages of constructing the building are not separable; they are just
convenient times to pay part of the cost of the building. Such a contract will be interpreted as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entire</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>For goods, § 2-307 says that unless specified otherwise, all
the goods have to be delivered and paid for at the same time. So § 240 applies to non-sale of goods
contracts, not including construction contracts which are entire. Employment contracts are generally divisible
at common law, but there are lots of employment statutes such as periodic pay
statutes. The common law doesn't do much
work as far as employment contracts work. But in any case, most employment situations are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

the perfect tender rule</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What kind of quality is necessary to trigger the opposing
party's duty? Let's look at sales of
goods contracts and find out what performance by a seller is needed before the
buyer's duty to pay the price is triggered. We'll generally assume a "barrelhead" transaction: if the seller gets up
to the required level of <span class=GramE>performance, that</span> will create
the duty to pay.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Oshinsky</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Lorraine Mfg. Co.</i> – The purchaser
has the duty to accept and pay only for those goods that are delivered on the
day specified on the contract. This is
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perfect tender rule</i>. In the UCC, the current version is § 2-601. The buyer has some choices if the goods that
are delivered or the tender of those goods have something wrong with them. The buyer can accept everything, reject
everything, or accept some units and reject others.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Under § 2-507(1), the seller's tender is a condition to the
buyer's duty to accept and pay. The
tender we're talking about is a tender pursuant to § 2-601 which conforms to
every aspect of the contract. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>§ 2-106
(2) says that goods <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>conform</i> when they
are in accordance with the obligations under the contract. This means that perfect tender doesn't mean
"perfect in the abstract". It means
perfect in relation to the contract. But
what's a contract under the UCC? It's
the "total legal obligation that results from the <span class=GramE>parties</span>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agreement </i>as effected by the law"…but
what's the "agreement"? It's the bargain
of the parties <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in fact</i> or by
implication from things like course of dealing.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A course of dealing is a sequence of previous conduct between
the parties to a particular transaction which is to be regarded as establishing
a basis of understanding for interpreting what they say and write in regard to
their current deals.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>§ 2-601 references § 2-612 which talks about installment
contracts. It turns out that in essence
the perfect tender rule doesn't apply to installment contracts. Installment contracts require or authorize
delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted. This statute does something similar yet
different from divisibility. Note that
the text of § 2-612 addresses what the buyer can do but not what the seller can
do. However, in case law, this has been
extended to the seller.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Today under the UCC, the buyer can reject any particular
installment that is non-conforming such that its value is "<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>substantially </i>impaired" by an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>incurable</i>
defect. If we have an installment
contract, rejections will almost always be wrongful. Thus, if you represent a seller, try to
interpret the facts to produce an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>installment
contract!</i> That's good for the
seller! But don't get too rambunctious,
because we interpret contracts as for single deliveries unless we say otherwise
in the contract.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Prescott &amp; Co. v.
J.B. <span class=SpellE>Powles</span> &amp; Co. </i>– Can the seller be excused
from full performance because the government commandeered shipping space for
wheat? The buyer has the right to refuse
the goods if they aren't delivered in the exact amount agreed upon.<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>§ 2-615 says that, among other things, non-delivery in part
isn't a breach of the seller's contract if it is caused by good faith
compliance with government regulation. The seller is definitely excused under this section if the above facts
happened today. The seller has to follow
subsections (b) and (c), though. The
seller must do its best and also give the buyer notice that there will be delay
or delivery.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But will the buyer be in breach if the buyer rejects the
"less than everything" delivery? § 2-616
says no! The buyer has a choice to
accept the 240 crates or reject them all without being in breach. There is an excuse here because it was
essentially impossible for the seller to perform. But the case stands for the idea that "you
can't tender an excuse"…or rather, you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i>,
but it won't trigger the other party's duty to perform. § 2-616 (2) says that when the buyer doesn't
respond to the justified notice from the seller that the seller's performance
will be delayed or partial within a reasonable time not exceeded 30 days, we'll
act like the buyer is saying "I don't want it."</p>

to the quality that the buyer bargained for, we'll let the buyer thrust them

the seller, but the goods can be resold. But with services, if the buyer isn't going to pay, there will typically
be nothing that the <span class=SpellE>servicor</span> can take away and
resell.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But there are some cases where this doesn't work. In a case like this, the court will try hard
to "wiggle off the perfect tender hook" and help out the seller. The court might try to turn the contract into
an installment contract, for example. The court might also try to argue that it's not a sale of goods contract
but rather a services contract. Or the
court might find that the buyer's rejection is bad faith under the
circumstances under § 1-203. Or the
court could find in the circumstances that it doesn't make sense to have a
perfect tender rule, and instead the court would substitute a substantial
performance rule. But this isn't <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i> the case! It may be important to the buyer to get the
goods precisely on time (consider the wedding dress example, or Christmas cards
on December 26<sup>th</sup>). </p>

Can the plaintiff recover even though he initially delivered a hearing aid not
in exact conformity with the contract given that he later tendered a model that
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>did</i> meet the terms of the
contract? This comes under § 2-508. § 2-508 (1) is simple enough, but § 2-508 (2)
allows an extension of contract time to the seller under certain circumstances.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It is not often that <span class=GramE>a seller</span>,
having contracted to sell X, tenders Y and reasonably expects that Y will make
the buyer happy but then gets a surprise rejection. This isn't the most frequent case,
though. Most often, the seller will
believe that he is tendering X, but the wrong stuff, Y, is in the box. Do we give the seller a further reasonable
time in those circumstances? Under §
2-508 (2), we could find that the seller reasonably believed he was tendered
precisely what was called for by the contract. But a counterargument is that this would knock too big a hole in the
perfect tender rule and we would give the seller more time too often. But case law seemed to have answered this
question in favor of the seller.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Compare this to the proposed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>new </i>§ 2-508…§ 2-508 (1) is similar to the current § 2-508 (1). But the new § 2-508 (2) removes the
"reasonably believes" requirement and talks about good faith instead. But it also gives protection to the
buyer. The cure must be "appropriate and
timely under the circumstances". If the
buyer's need for the goods wasn't that immediate, cure is appropriate, and the
seller will have some reasonable time to cure. But if the buyer needs the thing <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>right
now</i>, the seller won't have the chance to cure.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Consider § 2-607: acceptance is significant! It would be easier to reject the goods. Has the buyer accepted the goods in the §
2-606 sense? Did the buyer, in
accordance to § 2-606 (1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a), signify to the dealer
that the car conformed to the contract? Has the buyer had a "reasonable opportunity to inspect" as in § 2-606 (1<span
class=GramE>)(</span>b)? A significant
number of cases will say that the buyer hasn't had a reasonable opportunity to
inspect, and thus the goods haven't been inspected. With new cars, you don't get a reasonable
opportunity to inspect until you really get the car out on the road for a
while. The buyer can reject the goods
because there is a non-conforming tender because the brakes don't work.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Can you reject if you haven't yet accepted? Note that the perfect tender rule is
expressly subject to the sections on contractual limitations on remedy. The case law will vary based on whether the
defect is windshield wipers or brakes. If the windshield wipers don't work, the dealer should have the chance
to cure. But if the brakes are broke,
you should be able to thrust the car back on the seller.</p>

buyer's confidence is shaken, a repair is not proper tender of the goods
purchase. This is the so-called "shaken
faith" doctrine. When something
seriously shakes the buyer's faith in the goods, the buyer will be able to
reject. But if you have a dome light
that doesn't work, you won't get as much sympathy and you can't reject the car.</p>

&amp; Service v. Brooks</i> – Here's where we find out what a cure is. To cure, the seller must make the goods into
conforming goods. In this case, that
wasn't done. It was a half-baked effort
to cure, and that's not going to cut it.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Fortin v. Ox-Bow
Marina, Inc.</i> – This is about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>revocation
of acceptance</i>. Once you have
accepted, it's too late to reject. Under
§ 2-608, you can revoke acceptance, but it's harder to do than reject. You can't revoke unless the good's value is
substantially impaired in its value to you. Moreover, you must have accepted the good either assuming that the
non-conformity would be cured but it wasn't, or that it would have been
time-consuming and expensive to discover the non-conformity.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In a service contract, the <span class=SpellE>servicer</span>
renders the service. If the buyer
refuses, then the services are consumed and gone. Unless the <span class=SpellE>servicer</span>
can enforce the contract against the buyer, the <span class=SpellE>servicer</span>
will experience a big forfeiture! That's
a big reason why we don't have a perfect tender rule in services contract:
instead, we have a substantial performance rule.</p>

<p><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plante</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Jacobs </i>– Has there been substantial
performance of the contract to build the house, and if so, what should be the
measure of damages?<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>The contract was substantially performed
if the performance meets the essential purpose of the contract. If the performance is substantial but
incomplete and faulty, the correct measure of damages is the difference between
the value of the house as it stands and the value it would have had if it had
been built correctly. If there are a
small number of small defects that can be fixed at some reasonable expense,
that cost is allowed as part of the remedy.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What quality standard by the <span class=SpellE>servicer</span>
will trigger the <span class=SpellE>payor's</span> obligation to pay? The <span class=SpellE>servicer</span> must <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>substantially</i> perform (meet the
essential purposes of the contract), which triggers the owner's obligation to
pay. The <span class=SpellE>payor</span>
pays the contract price but then can have damages for the shortfall in the
builder's performance.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two possible rules for damages in a case like this:
(1) <span class=GramE>The</span> diminished value rule – How much would the
building be worth if perfect? How much
is it worth the way it is? Subtract the
second from the first and you'll have the damages. (2) The "fix-up" rule – How much would it
cost to fix up with over-half-baked house and make it fully baked?</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Jacob &amp; <span
class=SpellE>Youngs</span> v. </i><st1:country-region><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Kent</i></st1:place></st1:country-region>
– The contract in this case called for a certain kind of pipe, but a different
kind of pipe was used. The contract also
called for tearing down the whole thing if anything was done wrong. But Cardozo ignored this provision! On the facts on the case, the pipe installed
was perfectly good, but just happened to be from the wrong manufacturer. There would be a lot of economic waste involved
in tearing out the old pipe. So even if
you try to write the contract to force the builder to perform in a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perfect</i> fashion, you may not be able to.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But in most states, you could condition a builder's right to
be paid on an architect's certificate that says that the building meets the
plans and specifications. Recall how we
talked about conditions of personal satisfaction. The "architect's certificate" condition is an
analogue in the realm of "professional" opinion. But note that this doesn't work in <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State>! But the
builder's price might go up if you require the approval of an architect,
especially a particularly "finicky" architect. So you can get what you want as an owner, but you're going to have to
pay for it.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Reynolds v. <span
class=SpellE>Armstead</span></i> – You can get restitution to disgorge unjust
enrichment if we're confident that otherwise the owner would be unjustly
enriched. But if the performance is bad
enough, you might be able to take the position that there is no unjust
enrichment because by deviating so far from the contract, the builder has
become a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>volunteer</i> or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>officious intermeddler </i>who deserves no
restitution. There will be significant
flexibility and vagueness in determining whether someone who has performed less
than substantially is entitled to restitution.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Suppose that the contractor deviates from the contract
intentionally? Does the contractor get
nothing? Cardozo says yes. He says that the "willful transgressor" must
accept the consequences of his sins. If
he willfully deviates from the contract, it will usually prevent his
performance from being substantial and it won't be unjust for the owner to keep
the value of the work. Is that bad
law? <st1:City><st1:place>Clovis</st1:place></st1:City>
says yes, and we're getting away from it.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Recall, however, that we're arguing about the last payment
in an installment contract. It will
probably be something like the last 5% of the contract price.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What if the defendant in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Jacob
&amp; <span class=SpellE>Youngs</span></i> willfully uses the wrong kind of
pipe and then tries to get away with it? Does that make that person so bad that they shouldn't get paid? Not according to the Second Restatement in §
374.</p>

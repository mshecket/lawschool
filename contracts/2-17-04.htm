          with no consideration at all and have it stand up. A completed gift of
          land will be upheld even though there�s no consideration, as long as
          there�s no undue influence or anything bad like that. You can also
          convey land for what looks like inadequate consideration (�a

          you�ll be able to �plant houses� on the land, which has increased the
          land�s value. It�s not too hard to predict that this land will be
          developed soon. Farmer Brown is getting ready to retire and decides to
          sell his farm. He negotiates with various purchasers, and eventually
          sells the land to a developer at a price that is significantly more
          than it would be worth if the land were further from the town, yet
          significantly less than it would be if the land were closer to the
          town such that it�s ready for development immediately. The land is
          sold for $500,000. Shortly after the contract is made and performed,
          oil is discovered under the land. It will now be worth $50,000,000.
          Can Farmer Brown do anything about it? How might this situation differ

          Can the result of this case be justified merely on the basis of
          mistake? The sister trusts the brother to advise her in her business
          affairs. Neither of them knew that there was merchantable timber on
          the land. Both of them thought that $275 was an appropriate price for
          the land. But the brother cuts down the trees and gets $2500. What�s

          >Restatement Second � 151 says that �A mistake is a belief that is not
          in accord with the facts.� There is a mistake in this case, because
          both sides shared the belief that there was no merchantable timber on
          the land and that it was just pasture. That was not in accord with the
          facts: there <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">were</i> valuable
          trees on the land. It�s a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">shared</i> or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">mutual</i> mistake. Is that
          enough reason, by itself, to undo the contract, or do we also need a

          That would be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">actual</i> fraud,
          and she would be able to rescind on that basis. Notice that an
          ordinary garden-variety fraud case also involves a mistake. The
          frauder induces a mistake on the part of the victim. The frauder says,
          for example: �There is no valuable timber there.� That causes a
          mistaken belief on the part of the victim. It�s easier to give relief
          when one party is reprehensible and has caused the other party to be

          When he doesn�t, he�s breaking an implicit promise to pay fair value
          for the land. You don�t have a constructive fraud case against an
          outsider or anyone dealing at arm�s length, because there is no basis
          for implying a promise that such a person is going to treat you

          possible to make hard-edged deals in fiduciary situations or
          confidential situations, but these are situations where the courts are
          going to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">police the bargain</i>. To make

          Suppose that the Walkers, frustrated with the fact that Rose hasn�t
          gotten pregnant, agree to sell her to a butcher shop or beef packer
          for 5.5 cents per pound. After the contract is made, but before she�s
          been packed, it is discovered that she is pregnant. The Walkers say
          that they want her back. The buyer doesn�t want to give her back, but
          instead will sell her.</span

          thinks that the assumption was: �Probably barren, but might be able to
          breed.� That was mistaken because she was already pregnant! You
          couldn�t rescind if she hadn�t been pregnant, but then Sherwood took
          her home and got her pregnant later. The risk that Rose was pregnant
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">now</i> was not considered or

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Hodgkin wrote a letter to
her daughter and son-in-law saying that if they would come and take care of
her, that they would inherit her property. They came and started performing, but Hodgkin and the <span
class=SpellE>Brackenburys</span> started fighting. She wrote a deed to give her property to her
son Walter, who told the <span class=SpellE>Brackenburys</span> they had to get
out. The <span class=SpellE>Brackenburys</span>
sued in equity to force the son to give the property back to his mother and
keep Walter from kicking them out of the property. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The trial court found for the plaintiffs. <span class=GramE>The defendant appeals.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Was there a valid contract? Did the plaintiffs have an equitable interest
in the property? Did the plaintiffs breach
their duty under the contract?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> To accept an offer of a unilateral
contract, only performance is necessary. A trust concerning land must be created by a signed writing.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court finds that there
was a valid contract. They found that
Hodgkin made an offer for a unilateral contract which was accepted by the plaintiffs
by coming to take care of her.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court finds that this contract created an equitable interest in the land on the
part of the plaintiffs.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court finds that the trial judge did not err in finding that the plaintiffs did
not breach the contract and that Hodgkin was primarily responsible for things
going sour.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The appeal is dismissed.</span></p>

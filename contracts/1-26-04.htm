          bunch of money. For example, when a parent promises a child an

        ><span>

          implied-in-fact in this circumstances. Not everyone agrees. </span

        ><span>
          in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Marvin v. Marvin</i> will
          construe a contract implied-in-fact. But the </span

          ><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          view is the majority view in the country. In Meyer�s view, it�s too
          easy for someone to claim after a relationship ends that the other
          person should have paid them.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There�s a third approach that could be taken. Could the court find a
          quasi-contract on the basis of a contract implied-in-law? Was there
          unjust enrichment to disgorge even in the absence of an agreement to
          compensate? What�s the problem with that? Why is that unlikely to
          produce a positive result for a plaintiff? Has there been enrichment?
          But is it unjust? Probably not. If the services were rendered as gifts
          or as part of some informal arrangement to share services, then
          retaining the benefit of those services is not unjust.</span

          majority view? If you can show an express promise to pay for household
          services and form a partnership, then that�s going to work and
          possibly enable a recovery in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="moronevmorone.htm">Morone</a></i
          >. You would at least be able to state a cause of action. Meyer has
          doubts that the case can be proved, but if we accept the facts
          alleged, then a cause of action has been stated and there ought to be
          some relief.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the express contract? The woman alleges there was an
          express agreement to share in the benefits of the �joint venture� of
          the man going out into the world and getting a salary while the woman
          stays at home. What are the problems with an express contract on the
          facts of this case? The express contract was oral, and the man is
          almost certainly going to deny it. The contract was also vague. Even
          if she can prove it, it will be debatable just what the terms
          were.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court talks about
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gorden</i>, where they reversed
          because there wasn�t �clear and convincing� evidence to establish a
          contract against someone who died. It would be difficult and messy to
          prove an express contract!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But there is one good thing about having an express contract that
          would make it less difficult. Say the parties think it through, get a
          lawyer, draft it, sign it, and keep a copy in their respective safe
          deposit boxes. That�s an agreement that actually will be enforced.
          Educated, well-off people may tend to think through and write down an
          express agreement covering this kind of situation. On the other hand,
          less sophisticated people who don�t do this and rely on vague oral
          express agreements will have difficulties.</span

          statute of frauds. This one would have been okay because it could have

          get Mitchill to buy the house, Lath promised to tear down an ice house
          across the street on a different parcel of property. Mitchill didn�t
          like the ice house. The Laths didn�t tear down the ice house. Mitchill
          put a bunch of money into improving the farm and farmhouse. Mitchill
          sued for specific performance of the promise to tear down the ice
          house, and the trial court granted either that or, alternatively, Lath
          would have to pay $8,000 (which is pretty much everything they got for

          disagrees! Why should the Laths not have to perform their promise to
          remove the ice house? Is there any doubt that the Laths really did
          make that oral promise? Nope. Everyone agrees they really did promise
          that. There�s no doubt that they made and broke the promise. Mitchill
          is damaged to the tune of $8,000 by their breach. Why should the Laths
          get off scot-free? How can you justify the result of this case?</span

        <span

          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>No. The Laths promised to
          perform a service to remove an ice house from Lt. Governor Lunn�s land
          across from Mitchill�s house. They could have done that within a year.
          So it�s enforceable, event though the promise was oral. But why

      <br />

      <p>
        <span

          contract is a promise or set of promises that the law will enforce. So
          is the contract only the writing, or the writing plus the oral promise
          to remove the ice house? The majority says that the agreement in
          regard to the ice house is very closely
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">connected</i> to the written
          agreement for the purchase and sale of the farm. Since the ice house
          isn�t mentioned in the writing, you can�t prove the agreement about
          the ice house. Evidence about it should be kept out, and it�s not
          going to be part of the deal.</span

      <p>
        <span

          sometimes people win on the basis of lies. So part of what�s going on
          is an attempt to screen out liars. But we apply the rule in this case
          to Mitchill even though it seems clear she isn�t lying. Mitchill seems
          to get punished for not including everything in the writing that
          should be there. Writings are pretty objective. Witness testimony is
          messy and expensive to deal with.</span

          Another �virtue� of the rule is that is favors the party with the
          writing, which is the economically dominant party. Another
          justification is that if there were no parol evidence rule, it would
          be very difficult to decide any contract case on summary judgment.

          would admit a lot of extrinsic evidence, and others would keep out
          huge amounts of such evidence. Williston was an example of a
          �conservative� on this, while Corbin was an example of a �liberal�
          view on the rule. Corbin is more in the ascendancy right now, but
          there�s a little of both in every jurisdiction. Even within one

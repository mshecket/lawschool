      <p>
        <span
          >In order to decide whether to enforce a promise, we use the doctrine
          of consideration. That�s a powerful idea, but it�s not big enough to
          cover the entire world. There are some promises
          <i>without</i> consideration that we�ll enforce. For example, we�ll
          enforce promises that induced
          <i>foreseeable, justifiable reliance</i>. We have a preference for
          charitable organizations as promisees, and we�re more likely to
          enforce promises made to them.</span

          on the other side. Past consideration isn�t consideration, although
          once in a great while we want to enforce a promise because of
          something that happened before that promise was made.</span

          $2,000 a year running the sample department for McKittrick. That
          contract expires on December 15<sup>th</sup>. On December
          23<sup>rd</sup>, Embry goes to his boss to try to get his contract
          renewed for another year. Notice that Embry�s lawyer has to navigate
          around the statute of frauds, because we don�t enforce oral contracts
          not to be performed within a year. If this oral agreement had been
          made on December 13<sup>th</sup> to run until the following December
          15<sup>th</sup>, it would have been in the statute of frauds and would
          have been unenforceable. Instead, it is alleged that the new oral
          contract was formed on December 23<sup>rd</sup>. This is a contract to
          be performed within a year.</span

          �you�re all right, go get your men out and don�t let that worry you.�
          But that�s not the way McKittrick said it happened. McKittrick claimed

      <p>
        <span
          >Suppose the trial judge tells the jury that they must decide what
          words are spoken. The judge will charge them on the basis that if the
          jury credits the plaintiff�s version, they must do X, while if they
          credit the defendant�s version, they must do Y.<br />
          <br />
          However, in this case, the instruction that followed from �if you
          believe what Embry said� was held to be incorrect; this is the error
          on which the appellate court �hangs its hat�. Why are the instructions
          wrong? Embry has to believe he had a contract, <i>but</i> it doesn�t
          matter if McKittrick didn�t intend to reemploy him. Embry�s
          interpretation of what happened must be reasonable.<br />
          <br />
          It�s highly plausible, on the other hand, that McKittrick didn�t
          really intend to offer Embry a new contract. However, that
          <i>doesn�t matter</i>. The parties attach two different meanings to
          the same words. This court says that we will make a contract in this
          situation Embry�s understanding of McKittrick�s meaning is
          reasonable.</span

          They probably didn�t mean to. However, it is possible and perhaps even
          probable that the Geremias subjectively and sincerely believed that
          the communication from the credit union was a promise to pay the
          premiums. You could try to argue that the Geremias� view of the words
          of the credit union was more reasonable. Then you could well hold that
          there was a contract there.</span

          allowed to say so in court. The defendant objects that the bigwig�s
          subjective interpretation is irrelevant. The court rejects this
          argument and says it was no error for the trial court to admit the

          interpret subjectively that he had a contract. His interpretation also
          had to be reasonable. The same thing would be true if you apply the
          same rules to <i><a href="kabildevelopmentsvmignot.htm">Kabil</a></i

          He�s getting at the point made in <i>Robbins v. Lynch</i>, where we

        <span
          >At the time, cotton was the most important commercial commodity in
          the world. It was sort of the equivalent of how petroleum is
          today.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The court accepts the buyer�s defense. The buyer will not be held
          liable. The buyer argues that there was no meeting of the minds: �We
          didn�t agree�. The seller meant the later �Peerless�, while the buyer
          meant the earlier �Peerless�. The parties didn�t connect. They failed
          to really make an agreement; thus, there is no contract.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The whole idea of the law of contracts is to protect the justifiable
          expectations of the parties. By contrast, in
          <i>Ruffles v. Wichelhaus</i>, the court finds that the parties�
          meanings are equally reasonable. There�s no way to prefer one meaning
          over the other, and thus they rule that there was no contract. The
          factual basis on which this decision was made is that fact that the
          seller knew only of the later �Peerless�, while the buyer knew only of
          the earlier one. That makes the parties equally careful and
          responsible.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But what if both the buyer and the seller were aware of two different
          ships named �Peerless� sailing regularly from </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Bombay</span></st1:place
          ></st1:City
        ><span
          >? We could say that both parties were careless because each should
          have seen that there was some possibility of confusion, and thus
          clarify which �Peerless� they meant. In the real case, the parties
          were equally careful, while in this case they were equally careless.
          Therefore, in either case, we�ll say there was no contract.</span

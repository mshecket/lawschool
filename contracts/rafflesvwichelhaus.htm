        <b><span>Facts:</span></b

          on a ship called the �Peerless�. Little did they know that there were
          actually lots of ships with that name. When one of the �Peerlesses�
          arrived, the plaintiff was ready to sell, but the defendant
          repudiated. The defendant argued that the agreement had been to buy
          cotton from the <i>other</i> �Peerless� which arrived in October, and
          so the defendant wasn�t bound to buy cotton off of the �Peerless� that
          arrived in December. The plaintiffs argued that it didn�t matter what
          ship it was and that the point of naming the ship was that if the ship
          sunk while in transit, the contract would be void.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Should the defendant be bound by the agreement to buy the cotton from
          the <i>other</i> �Peerless�?</span
        >

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          There is no binding contract unless both sides agreed to the same
          thing.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          Apparently, the court accepts the argument of the defense that the
          contract was too ambiguous to uphold.</span

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          ProCD sold telephone directories on CD-ROM. Their product had a
          shrinkwrap license on the non-commercial version of their software
          that made the buyer agree not to resell the information. The defendant
          ignored this and resold the information. Zeidenberg argues that only
          the text written on the outside of the package counts as part of the
          contract offered by placing the product on the shelf and agreed to by
          purchasing the product. The district court agreed and found for
          Zeidenberg. ProCD appealed.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> Are shrinkwrap licenses enforceable upon software buyers?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Shrinkwrap licenses are just as enforceable as contracts in
          general.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court starts with the proposition that licenses are covered by the
          UCC and common law just like ordinary contracts. The court finds that
          one of the terms that the consumer agrees to upon purchase of this
          software is assent to a license. Some of the terms of that license may
          be inside the package.

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court ends up finding more or less that it can�t be the case that
          only the outside box can have the full license. The contract between
          ProCD and Zeidenberg wasn�t formed when he paid for the CD-ROM, but
          rather when he read and accepted the enclosed license terms. He had an
          opportunity to reject the terms once he had read them but he failed to
          do so. That effectively means he accepted the terms.</span

<p><b><span>More on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="cohenvkranz.htm">Cohen v. Krantz</a></i></span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
we have an ordinary garden variety contract for the purchase and sale of real
estate. It’s contract to sell a house
for $40,000. The buyer pays $4,000 down
at contract formation. Closing was
originally going to be on November 15<sup>th</sup>, but it was delayed by
mutual agreement until December 15<sup>th</sup>. The purchaser will come to the closing table
with $24,500 in cash and will sign off on the assumption of an $11,500
mortgage. We have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>concurrent precedent conditions</i> at the closing. Each side has to tender its stuff in order to
switch on the duty of the other side.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Now
we have a squabble! It’s pretty easy to
figure out that the purchaser regrets getting into the deal. The case suggests that the market price of
the house was really $33,500, and the purchaser has agreed to pay $40,000. The purchaser probably thought it was worth
it at the time, but now she knows that she has a bad deal, and she wants
out. A lawyer helps her look for a breach
on the vendor’s part with which they can get out of the contract and get restitution. So this seems to be in quite bad faith.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It’s
not uncommon that someone will regret getting into a deal that will end up
costly. The purchaser looks for a legal “escape
hatch” to get out. But there really isn’t
much in terms of defaults or defects on the part of the vendor. There are two tiny, tiny defects: the
swimming pool doesn’t have a certificate of occupancy, and the fence goes a
little too far. The purchaser cites
these to try to get her money back. But
it doesn’t work! The purchaser loses not
just the down payment, but another $1500 in damages!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
vendor <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>was not</i> in default, but the
purchaser <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>was</i>. Why wasn’t the vendor in default? <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Because
the purchaser never put the vendor in default</i>. The purchaser could have tendered the money
and willingness to assume the existing mortgage on December 15<sup>th</sup>. If the vendor hadn’t been forthcoming with
his end of the deal at that point, the vendor might be in breach, or more
likely, the court will give the vendor maybe an extra week to come up with a
clear title. However, the purchaser didn’t
tender.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
purchaser sent a letter through her lawyer saying that “the title wasn’t legal,
so send us back our down payment money or else we’ll sue you!” The court finds that the demand in this
letter was unjustified and was actually an anticipatory repudiation of the contract! The purchaser put herself in breach, which
allowed the vendor to recover damages! The vendor gets to keep the $4,000 plus the other $1,500 the vendor
would have made in profit! Yow! So don’t get too “rambunctious”. Don’t grab onto something small when you’re
just trying to get out of a bad deal. If
you do so, you’ll run the risk that you’ll be the party in breach and you’ll be
liable for damages.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Just
for review, the vendor needs contract price minus market price to be put in the
position performance would have done. That’s $40,000 minus $33,500, or $5,500. The vendor already has $4,000, so the vendor needs $1,500 more.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
order for the vendor to be able to sue the purchaser, the vendor would have to
tender the deed to the property. That
switches on the purchaser’s duty and puts the purchaser in breach if she doesn’t
tender her payment and her signature. The vendor didn’t tender the deed! Why was the purchaser in default nevertheless? The purchaser <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>repudiated</i>! That <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>excuses</i> the vendor’s tender. It doesn’t make any sense to require the
vendor to tender performance if the purchaser has flatly and clearly repudiated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Don’t
forget what we already learned about repudiation. Repudiations can often be a lot fuzzier than
a flat, clear statement like: “I’m not going to perform.” Unless you have that statement, you should
think about tendering performance, demanding adequate assurances, or taking
other action to clarify whether or not you have a repudiation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
even if tender is excused, the vendor must show that he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>could have</i> performed. If the
vendor was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unable to perform</i>,
because, for example, the vendor had incurable title defects, then the idea is
that the vendor doesn’t deserve to recover damages even though the purchaser repudiated. The repudiation must be the “but-for” cause
of the vendor’s non-tender of performance. Here, the vendor could have tendered a clear title quite easily. If the purchaser had informed the vendor of
her problems, the vendor could have cured these ills and then performance could
have proceeded.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>At
closing, there is usually going to be a title defect: the mortgage against the property. That mortgage will get paid off by the
purchaser’s money.</span></p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><b><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Beecher</span></i></b></st1:place></st1:City><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span> v. Conradt</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
have already seen some of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Mansfield</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s ideas that we should do
what we can to minimize the extension of credit. To the extent that the transaction doesn’t
require the extension of credit, it shouldn’t be there. In this deal, credit <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>is</i> required. This is a contract
for the sale of land. The vendor’s
promise is to give a deed to Greenacre. The purchaser’s promise is to pay the agreed price in five equal annual
installments. When you have that kind of
a deal, since it’s impossible for all of the performances to occur at the same
time when the deal was made, the vendor is extending credit to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>somebody</i>. The parties could have contracted into
whatever they wanted, but they didn’t.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
in this situation, the court fills in the purchaser extending credit to the
vendor. The purchaser makes the five
annual payments, and then upon the final payment, the purchaser is entitled to
the deed. The purchaser’s obligation to
make the first four payments is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unconditional</i>,
but the tender of the last payment is conditioned upon the final delivery of
the deed. Notice how the court plugs in
constructive conditions that weren’t actually in the contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
look how things change: the purchaser misses all five payments! The vendor could have sued the purchaser for
each of the payments as soon as each one was due! Alternatively, the vendor could have waited
until the second payment was due and could have brought one suit for the first
two payments.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
what happened here, the vendor waited until all five payments were due, and
then sued. But upon the due date of the
fifth payment, the vendor must tender the deed in order to switch on the
purchaser’s duty! <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Things can change, creating constructive conditions that wouldn’t have
been there if the parties had acted earlier</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
purchaser hasn’t paid when he was supposed to, and the vendor hasn’t done what
he was supposed to do either.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
the remedy here? The remedy the vendor
is seeking is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>full payment of the price</i>. In most circumstances, certainly with goods
under Article 2, we don’t like “cram down” remedies where the buyer makes a contract
to buy goods and then decides: “I don’t want the goods.” Article 2 won’t make the buyer pay the full
price unless there’s a good reason. The
remedy will usually go more shallowly into the buyer’s pocket. The seller will keep the goods and the buyer
will have to pay out the contract price minus the market price, rather than the
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>full price</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may be</i> different with land. We may be more willing to have a “cram down”
remedy that forces the buyer to pay the full price and take the land even if he
doesn’t want it. How come? One reason is historical: when you have a contract
for the purchase and sale of land, it’s specifically enforceable for the
purchaser. Specific performance should
be available for the purchaser. But then
we have the weird “mutuality of remedy” doctrine, which says that for the sake
of fairness, we must allow the specific performance remedy to the vendor,
too. That doesn’t make much sense, but
that’s why we say that vendors can get specific performance of land contracts.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
remedy often makes sense, though not always. What are the virtues in favor of specific performance for the vendor of
land? Recall that when the contract is
formed, the purchaser gets equitable title to the land. When the purchaser defaults, the vendor needs
to clear the title so he can sell to someone else. The old-fashioned way to do that is to sue
the purchaser for specific performance. This amounts to foreclosure: you foreclose the purchaser’s interest in
the land. In court, the land is sold at
auction to whoever will buy it. In that
sale, the purchaser’s title to that land will evaporate and the vendor will get
the cash. Another advantage is that if
the purchaser is in possession but in hopeless default and the purchaser claims
title to the land, an action for specific performance can result in ejecting
the purchaser, clearing title, and cleaning up the mess. Why, if you can do it in equity, can’t you do
it at law? Do you need to be able to do
it both ways?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Over
time, we’ve been getting more stingy with equitable relief. Money damages will be enough for the vendor
more often. The purchaser can give the
vendor a quit-claim deed, which may result in a much faster and cheaper
solution. Specific performance is
cumbersome, and the purchaser may want to avoid that method of settlement. So occasionally, we’ll make the purchaser pay
the entire price of land.</span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Stewart v.
Newbury</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is another “who’s-in-default” case. It’s
a different type of contract: this is a construction (services) contract. Stewart agrees to build a foundry for the
Newburys. Stewart starts building, and
after he’s done a lot of building, he says: “Pay me.” They say no! So Stewart quits in the middle of building the foundry! Was Stewart justified in quitting because
they didn’t pay? Or were they justified
in not paying such that Stewart put himself in total breach when he quit?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
trial court wanted to know if it was understood that the payments were to be
made monthly. There was no express
agreement on when payments were to be made! If there was no such understanding, the Newburys were <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>obligated to make payments at “reasonable times”. Thus, the trial court would find for the plaintiff.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
what does the Court of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> do? They say “this is not the law”! But what is the law? In the absence of some other express
provision, substantial performance is required before payment can be
demanded. That’s the constructive
condition or off-the-rack rule here! When you have a performance on one side that takes time in exchange for
a performance on the other side that can be performed in an instant (like
paying money), the constructive order of performance is that the performance
that takes time goes first. Only when
that performance is completed is the obligation to pay triggered.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Recall
that substantial performance means “meets the essential purposes of the contract”. It’s a practical test and what it means in
particular circumstances can vary and be fuzzy. But nothing half-finished or less will constitute substantial
performance. Substantial performance is
based in part on the fact that construction of a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>perfect building</i> is impossible. If you meet the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>essential</i>
purposes of the contract, that will trigger the owner’s duty to pay the price. The owner is entitled to all of the plans and
specifications, and thus can recover any damages suffered by any small
shortfall between the actual performance rendered and what was promised.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
do we argue for the position of the Court of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>? In smaller service situations, the idea that
the servicor comes first and the payor comes around only when the servicor is
done makes sense, and in fact that’s how the world works! You go get your hair cut, and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>then</i> you pay. The plumber comes and fixes you pipe, and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>then</i> you pay. That’s a useful way to operate. When you take a job, you extend credit to
your employer. You work first, and then the
employer pays you later. In the old
days, you might have to extend a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>whole lot</i>
of credit to the employer.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> might be right for two big
reasons: it’s hard to draw a line between big and small performances. More importantly, in construction contracting,
it is the universal practice to contract out of this deal <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>expressly</i>. If you want
periodic payments, you must <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>say so</i> in
the contract. What if there was oral
evidence of an agreement to pay periodically?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
some situations, we reverse by agreement. Sometimes the payment comes first, and the performance comes last. For example, you pay for your ticket, and
then see the show afterwards. Another
example is law school tuition. If you
don’t like the show, it’s easier to get the money out of you before you find
out that you didn’t like it.</span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Kelly Contr.
Co. v. Hackensack Brick Co.</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is both a goods contract and a services contract. The services contract is between Kelly and the
school district. The goods contract is a
contract between Kelly and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Hackensack</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> to sell the brick needed to
build the school. In the construction
jargon, we would call </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Hackensack</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> a “material man” because
they are not furnishing any services. The terms of the goods contract are that the brick will be delivered bit
by bit. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Hackensack</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> delivers a bit of brick,
and then they ask for payment. But Kelly
says: no way! Not until you’re
done! Who’s in default?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
turns out that the construction company is right. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Hackensack</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> must deliver <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all </i>the brick before the obligation of
Kelly to pay is triggered. But…<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is this still law</i>? Consider the effect of § 2-307. Does this change the result in this case? Note that this case happened in 1918.</span></p>

<p><b><span>More on the battle of the
forms</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
previously talked about what <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>used</i> to
happen at common law and what happens today under the current version of §
2-207. Let's review some hypotheticals.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Under
§ 2-207, the buyer comes up with a purchase order offer for an expensive
voltage regulator. The buyer is a big
and sophisticated business buyer. The
buyer fills out one of their own purchase order forms with dickered terms on
the front and boilerplate on the back. If the seller simply signed and returned the form, then both parties
would have signed off on the same agreement and it would be no sweat. But here, what usually happens actually
happens. The seller responds with his
own acknowledgement form which has the seller's own boilerplate on the back.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
on the back side of the seller's acknowledgement form is an arbitration clause,
but otherwise the two forms agree. How
does § 2-207 handle it?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Under
§ 2-207 (1), we view the seller's acknowledge as a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>definite and seasonable </i>expression of acceptance (looks, acts,
quacks like an acceptance). Even though
the seller's acknowledgement states an additional term, it acts as an
acceptance. So what happens to the
additional term?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Under
§ 2-207 (2), the additional term shall be treated as a proposal for an addition
to the contract. The seller is, in
effect, proposing that the agreement should be covered by arbitration instead
of litigation. It's a deviant acceptance
of the offer, but it still operates as an acceptance. We deal with the proposal for an addition
under § 2-207 (2)(b). You get the contract
early on when the acknowledgement is dispatched, and in this case it will be on
the buyer's terms, with no arbitration.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Take
a different case: let's say the seller's acknowledgement has a big difference
in the dickered terms, namely price. The
key is that the seller's acknowledgement is treated as a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>counteroffer</i> and not a "definite and seasonable expression of
acceptance". The answer ought to be: no contract
at this point. If they both walk away
now, they haven't reached an agreement and that's the end of it. On the other hand, if the buyer ships the
goods and the seller accepts them, you may be able to treat that as an
acceptance of the seller's counteroffer. In this hypothetical, however, we would suppose that the two sides would
realize they hadn't come together and that they have more haggling to do.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Consider
a third variation on this. Suppose that
the buyer, a sizeable merchant, wants to buy this expensive voltage regulator
and again the buyer sends the seller its purchase order, which has
fill-in-the-blanks dickered terms on the front and lots of boilerplate on the
back. The buyer fills it in with the
price and delivery date. But now the
buyer has carefully "lawyered" its form such that the purchase order makes use
of the defensive opportunities provided by § 2-207 (2)(a) and (2)(c). It will do so with boldface, all-caps
language tracking the language of the statute.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
will say that "l'>THIS PURCHASE ORDER OFFER
EXPRESSLY LIMITS ITS ACCEPTANCE TO THE TERMS OF THIS OFFER.</b>"</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It will
say that "l'>THIS BUYER OBJECTS TO ANY
TERMS VARYING FROM ANY TERMS IN THIS OFFER.</b>"</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Additionally,
the terms in the buyer's purchase order are strongly pro-buyer. Among other things, the seller is to provide
a panoply of warranties and no limitation of liability.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
seller replies with a mirror image of the dickered terms. But the boilerplate expressly and
conspicuously disclaims warranties and limits liability. This form also uses the defensive "unless"
clause from § 2-207 (1). They'll do this
in all-caps and boldface. "<b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY MADE CONDITIONAL ON
ASENT TO ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT TERMS THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS.</b>"</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
buyer and seller want to do a deal! They
disregard these terms that the lawyers have drafted for them. Usually, there's no big deal. But let's say the voltage regulator blows
up! The buyer wants to recover from the seller,
but the seller claims that they've disclaimed liabilities and limited
warranties. What do we do?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It's
hard to find an offer and acceptance given all the boldface, all-caps
disclaimers. The buyer has said that you
have to accept <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all our terms</i>, and the
seller has said that they expressly <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>refuse
</i>to accept the buyer's terms. What
have we got? Do we have offer and
counteroffer? Are we back where the common
law has left us? Is there another way
out under § 2-207? Yes!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
suggestion: how about finding a contract when the seller's acknowledgement is
dispatched? We could include terms upon
which the two sides coincide, and if the boilerplate differs, we'll disregard
both and fill in gaps with off-the-shelf provisions. Under what authority can we do this? We can do it under § 2-207 (3).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
writings of the parties in this case don't seem to establish a contract, but a
lot of courts will follow the suggest that the parties' conduct treating this
as a made deal as soon as the acknowledgement is dispatched and the product is
shipped means that a contract is formed. The only problem is figuring out what the terms are.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here's
some jargon: we're going to have what's referred to in the case law as the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knock-out rule</i>. Each party <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>knocks out</i> the other party's terms, and we're going to fill-in with
off-the-rack generic terms. That means
the buyer wins! When there is no express
agreement otherwise, this Act is going to provide for full warranties and full
remedies. In this case, we knock out the
seller's efforts to disclaim warranties and limit liability.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But…is
this giving the buyer something they'd like to have but they're unwilling to
pay for? What can the seller do? You can say "damn!" But what else can the seller do? On warranties, the buyer wins. What can the seller do? They can put "COUNTEROFFER" in big letters
when they respond to the purchase order.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Not
only do we have a battle going on between the buyer and the seller, we also
have internal battles in each organization. The seller's salespeople want to make a deal and they don't want to tick
off the customer. They don't like the
lawyers and accountants who want to put "COUNTEROFFER" on there.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
businesspeople might be forgiven for disregarding the pathological case, and
the lawyers might be forgiven for wanting to avoid major liability.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>You
could also instruct the seller not to ship until they get the buyer to agree to
their terms.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
will sometimes happen and sometimes work? You can respond: "You're asking for warranties at our non-warranty
price. If you want warranties, you'll
have to pay more." That's more likely to
succeed legally and is somewhat more palatable to the seller's businesspeople.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
actually happens in most of these cases? The situation is not as strong in the buyer's favor as you might
think. Think about the case of repeat
customers. The buyer has a lot of reason
to know before he orders that the seller wants to limit remedies and exclude
warranties. Under those circumstances,
whose expectations should be protected?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Prior
course of dealing between parties will have a lot to do with what the parties
have agreed upon. This may have a big
influence on just what terms are taken to be part of the contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>§
2-207 is considered to be a very good friend of lawyers. That's also a serious criticism of how the
thing works. There's a lot of litigation
that can spring up around it. Many
people believe that § 2-207 hasn't done the job right.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The new Article 2</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>The
new § 2-206 (3) codifies much of the current § 2-207, but there's no grand
defensive clause at the end. There's
also a stylistic difference: the current version has a lot of mechanical things
that haven't worked well. The new
version is much more general principles rather than mechanical specifics.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the new § 2-207, course of dealing and custom becomes more important. An awful lot of effort has gone into fixing
this problem and this is where they finally ended up. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> thinks this is going to
result in an improvement, but it's going to depend on how the case law goes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
this introduced to the idea of using printed forms to make agreements when you
have two merchants, each with their own printed writing. But what happens in the case where only one
party has a form? Typically, there's a
business that is the strong party economically and a consumer or small business
with no form. These are sometimes called
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contracts of adhesion</i>, meaning the
more powerful party says: "Here's the deal. If you want to take the deal, sign it, and you're bound by what you
sign." It's called a contract of
adhesion because the only choice of the little guy is to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>adhere</i> or walk away from the deal. This has caused a lot of problems for a lot of people.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Allied Van
Lines, Inc. v. Bratton</span></i></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Mrs.
Bratton is going to move to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and she picks Allied for
her moving company. They pick up her
stuff and put it on the truck. They give
her a bill of lading to sign and she signs it without looking at it. One of the terms in the bill of lading was
that if the goods were stolen (which they later were) Bratton would get $1.50
per pound. When the goods were stolen,
Allied paid out $3,000, while Bratton wanted the full value of her goods, which
was more like $10,000.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> says "Never sign anything
without reading it" is not good advice unless you're being paid for it and paid
well. The real idea is that Bratton knew
it was a contractual document, and Bratton knew or ought to have known that when
she signed a bill of lading on a moving van company's terms she would be bound
by those terms.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Look
at § 211: in this situation, when you're offered a deal by a business party and
they say "here's where you sign", courts will say that you're bound by what you
sign. That's at least where we <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>start</i>, though maybe not where we <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stop</i>. This section says that when the adherent is being asked to enter into a
deal on the seller, carrier, or creditor's terms, the adherent knows, or at
least ought to know, that the deal is on the merchant's terms. The adherent will be bound to this <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless</i> one or more of the terms is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>surprising, oppressive</i> or otherwise
wouldn't be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fair</i> to the
adherent. But if the terms are not
outrageous or unreasonable, the adherent assents to deal on the seller's terms.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Note
that Allied lost another case where they actually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>lied</i> about the terms of an agreement.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Agricultural
Ins. Co. v. </span></i></b><st1:City><st1:place><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
  normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Constantine</span></i></b></st1:place></st1:City><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
how do you distinguish the adventures of Bova from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Allied</i>?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Bova
parked her car, leaving the keys in the ignition. It got stolen. Mrs. Bova's insurance company paid her for
the damage, and then turns around and sues the parking lot. The parking lot says there can't be liability
because the parking "ticket" disclaims liability for theft of the car. What's the difference? The "ticket" was taken to be no more than a "claim
check". It's not considered a
contractual document. It's the same
thing in…</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><b><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Sharon</span></i></b></st1:place></st1:City><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span> v. City of </span></i></b><st1:City><st1:place><b
 ><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
 >Newton</span></i></b></st1:place></st1:City><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
parent signs a release, and had time to take it home and think about it. When you just take a claim check for your car
or hat or anything, you rarely even read it. People don't consider claim checks important documents that need to be
read. There is a lot of law that says
this is so.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
Bova's case, the ticket was found not to be a contract, but furthermore, the court
says that the agreement would be against public policy. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> says this is wrong. The deal isn't whether the person who parks
the car gets paid, but rather whether the insurance company can get into the
parking lot's pocket. If there is an
agreement, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> argues that it makes sense
to enforce it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you want there to be an agreement, you would need to have a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big sign</i> with not a lot of words that
the parking customer will definitely see.</span></p>

          entered World War II, the plaintiffs leased some land to the defendant

          entered the war, the government ordered most new car sales
          discontinued. The defendant got an oral waiver of the contract�s
          conditions from one of the plaintiffs. However, the defendant left the
          premises and gave written notice that he was repudiating the contract.
          The plaintiffs first gave written notice to the defendant reaffirming
          their oral waiver, then they gave up and started renting the property
          to others. The plaintiffs sued for unpaid rent. The trial court found
          for the plaintiffs, saying that war conditions hadn�t relieved the
          defendant of his duty under the contract. The defendant
          appealed.</span

          Frustration arises when the �expected value of performance to the

        <b><span style="font-size: 14pt">Analysis:</span></b
        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          The court finds that both parties knew that war was coming and that
          the government�s action of stopping all car sales was not
          unforeseeable. Furthermore, the possibility for the defendant of
          selling new cars was not completely eliminated but merely
          restricted.</span

        <span style="font-size: 14pt"
          >The court also refuses to apply the doctrine of frustration to this
          case on public policy grounds. It would be expensive and wasteful for
          tenants to repudiate leases just because their businesses weren�t as
          successful as they expected. This doctrine is only meant to be used in
          extreme cases, the court says. The purpose of a lease must be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">totally destroyed</i> or must
          become really difficult to accomplish in order for a lessee to be
          excused from paying rent.</span

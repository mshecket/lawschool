          >Louise made a contract with Dix to build a nursing home. Though
          Louise fulfilled its contractual obligations, Dix didn�t complete
          construction in time. An auditor ruled that Louise suffered �no
          compensable damages�. Louise objected to the trial court�s application
          of the auditor�s rulings and said it was entitled to the difference in
          the value of the building as it was left uncompleted and the value the
          building would have had if it had been completed.</span

          >What is the general principle at work in this case? What could be its
          broader applications? If you can make up a breach by buying what you
          need from another vendor at the same price, then no harm was done to
          you and you ought not collect damages. I think <i>Crail </i>is
          consistent with <i>Louise</i> because both apply the general principle
          that damages need only be awarded that are sufficient to make the
          plaintiff as well off as if the contract had been performed.</span

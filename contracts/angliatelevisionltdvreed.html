          contracted with Reed to be in a TV movie. Reed breached after he found
          out he was double-booked. </span

        ><span>
          sued for reliance damages, including expenses incurred before the
          contract was made. At trial, the full measure of damages was
          awarded.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Can the plaintiff collect reliance damages for expenses incurred
          before making the contract on which the plaintiff relied?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          When lost profit can�t be proved, a plaintiff is entitled to recover
          reliance damages.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court is <i>wrong, wrong, wrong</i> when it says that �[t]he
          aggrieved party cannot recover both lost profits and wasted
          expenditures and must elect between them�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court argues that at the time of contract formation, the
          defendant knew that the plaintiff had already spent money setting up
          the production. Thus the defendant could have foreseen that breaching
          the contract would cause the plaintiff to lose out on the money they�d
          spent so far.</span

        <u><span>Question</span></u
        ><span></span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The evidence mentioned in the hypothetical would tend to show that
          the wages paid to secretaries were actually <i>fixed</i> rather than
          <i>variable</i> and thus would not contribute to reliance damages. In
          this factual pattern, the money for secretaries would have been spent
          anyway, and thus they wouldn�t have truly spent it in
          <i>reliance</i> on Dempsey�s performance.</span

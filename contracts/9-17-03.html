          there�s a windfall for the defendant, and there�s a hole in the

          state has detailed statutes dealing with employment. For example, all
          states have �periodic pay� statutes: you must get paid (in cash money
          or, more recently, with checks or, even more recently, by direct
          deposit) weekly, bi-weekly or at least monthly. Therefore, you

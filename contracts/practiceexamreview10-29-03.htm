<p><span>Do
we need to cite to all relevant UCC sections? If you’re dealing with a statute, it’s useful to apply its wording. You’ll rarely have to cite a statute other
than Article 2 of the UCC. That’s not to
say that it’s wrong to cite to the Restatement or a case, but it may not be
prudent. You might get the case wrong
and be better off without the citation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Including
the obvious doesn’t lose you points, nor does it gain you points.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>“Liquidated
damages” is a label applied to an agreed damages clause when a court will
enforce that clause. “Penalty” is applied
to clauses that go against public policy and will not be enforced.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Know
the important statutory provisions, like § 2-201, § 2-209(1), § 2-706, §
2-708(1), § 2-708(2), § 2-709, § 2-712 etc.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Learn
the statutes. Become comfortable with
them. Use them on the exam. It’s a bad mistake to waste your time leafing
through the statute book looking for something to cite.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Enforcement
of promises related to the sale of goods is generally more liberal than the
enforcement of other promises.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Clovis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> shall not bug us about
contracts in consideration of marriage under the statute of frauds, nor will he
bug us about contracts to answer for the debt of another. The latter is important, but complicated. The statute of frauds that we ought to learn
about are (1) contracts for the sale of goods, (2) contracts for the sale of
land, and (3) contracts not to be performed within a year. Those are the most important parts of the
statute.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Use
your judgment. Say what you really think
and not what you necessarily think the professor wants to hear.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>You
need to learn the material aggressively enough that you can apply it to a
different factual pattern than the one we applied it to here.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Don’t
try to defraud the teacher. If you’re
doubtful about something, it might be useful to state your doubts. You should spend at least half the time you
have on essay questions thinking about each question before you start to write.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
only section of the statute of frauds that applies to contracts for services is
the “not to be performed within a year” clause. “Not to be performed within a year” is interpreted by courts as “not
performable within a year”. A contract <i>for
life</i> can be performed within a life. Anybody could die in a good deal short of a year.</span></p>

review…it’s pretty okay to include extraneous stuff, but <i>don’t screw it up</i>. <i>Don’t be wrong</i>.</span></p>

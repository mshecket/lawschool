        <span
          >The plaintiff is the wife of the defendant�s brother, that is to say,
          the plaintiff is the sister-in-law of the defendant. The defendant
          wrote the plaintiff a note making a promise that if the plaintiff
          would come down and see him he would let her stay on his land.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The plaintiff had resided on public land, and on the basis of the
          promise, she decided to pull up her stakes and move to the defendant�s
          place. It was only a 60-70 mile move, but in 1845, it was a big deal.
          The defendant gives her a comfortable house for two years, but then he
          kicks her out for some unknown reason.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The plaintiff sues on his promise and recovers at trial. That�s
          reversed on appeal to the Supreme Court of Alabama. It�s a very short
          opinion, and it�s weird because it�s actually a dissent. The dissenter
          writes and says that the majority voted to send the plaintiff away
          with nothing.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There�s a promise. It�s written down in the letter. Also, after two
          years of performance, he threw her out, which appears to be a breach.
          However, there is no remedy against the defendant, which must imply
          that the court finds that the promise was not enforceable. It was
          found to be purely gratuitous and without consideration. Therefore,
          the brother-in-law is free to change his mind.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >When people promise to make gifts, they frequently define just what
          they�re promising to give. The defendant in this case basically said
          that he would give the plaintiff �the place�, but the defendant
          doesn�t say much else.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why do people promise to make gifts? It�s usually because they
          <i>like</i> the promisee and they want that person to �do well�, as
          the brother-in-law says in
          <i><a href="kirkseyvkirksey.htm">Kirksey</a></i
          >. There is no consideration for such promises.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Consider the �tramp case�. This hypothetical distinguishes a
          �condition of a gratuitous promise� from the �price of a promise�. A
          gift promise doesn�t turn into a contract just because you aren�t
          promising to do
          <i>every little thing involved in the giving of the gift</i>.</span

          would have come out differently if the plaintiff had been booted out
          of the house <i>immediately</i> upon arriving. Then she would have
          incurred a detriment, but <i>no </i>benefit at all. The facts as they
          are show that she got at least two years� worth of good livin�. That�s
          something, and that might be all that was really promised. The letter
          itself was pretty vague.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >It is easier to enforce a definite, clear promise like the one in
          <i>Ricketts</i> than the vague one in

      <p>
        <span
          >Another factor that goes against enforcement of this promise is the
          fact that there was no trade involved. The defendant probably wasn�t
          trading the plaintiff�s move for giving her a home.</span

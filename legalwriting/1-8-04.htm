          office memo and (2) the trial court brief. The issues invoked will be
          similar, but the brief will be more complex and will require more
          independent research. The memo will be less of an open assignment than
          the brief. In other words, we�ll have more latitude in looking up the
          case law in the second assignment that the first.</span

          likes the Redbook! It has grammar in it. When the heck was the last
          time we did grammar? It�s been a while! So this book has a little
          refresher course. �It�s like an adult grammar manual.� But it has oh
          so much more! So if you�re rusty on your writing skills, check it
          out!</span

        <span
          >What do lawyers really do when they write an office memo or trial
          brief? There are some basic types of reasoning they�ll use to try to
          persuade a judge or jury.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >When you use
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">rule-based reasoning</i>, you
          must first figure out just what the rule is. If the rule is a statute,
          for example, it will be easy to pick out. It�s harder to pick out the
          rule from case law. Once you know the rule, you can use the rule to
          solve the problem at hand. In a predictive memo you say: �If you do
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">this</i>, then based on
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">these </i>authorities
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">this</i> will probably
          happen.�</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
          ><span>Analogical reasoning</span></i
        ><span>
          is something we�ve done all our lives. You look for similarities
          between the authorities and the case at hand. You say: �The facts of
          this case are like the facts of the case where the rule comes from.�
          Notice how this is similar to rule-based reasoning.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
          ><span>Counter-analogical reasoning</span></i
        ><span>
          is just the opposite. You point out the differences between the facts
          of the case at hand and the facts the case where the rule comes from.
          This is something you will want to do if the rule is bad for your
          client. You say: �Sure, that was the rule in that case, and if it were
          applied to this case I would lose. But this case isn�t like that
          case.� This is what we do when we say that a certain case or
          hypothetical is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">distinguishable</i> from an
          authoritative case.</span

        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
          ><span>Policy-based reasoning</span></i
        ><span>
          goes along with counter-analogical reasoning. �Say the rule is X.
          Let�s also say that the rule was created to eliminate behavior Y. But
          what we have in the present case is behavior Z, which is not the
          behavior we were trying to prevent. In fact, it might be behavior
          society wants to encourage. Therefore, we should not enforce rule X in
          the case of behavior Z.�</span

          ><span>Narrative reasoning</span></i
        ><span>
          is frequently seen in closing arguments on TV trials. You persuade the
          listener by telling a story in a compelling way so that your story has
          a gut appeal. You have the chance to color your case and client with
          whatever characteristics they have which are most appealing or
          favorable. Take
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Hawkins v. McGee</i> for
          example: you could spin the story to make the grafting doctor a right
          bastard. But that doesn�t have much to do with a particular rule of
          law. But it does have persuasive value. The doctor has encouraged
          activity that turns out to be harmful to someone else.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">objectivity</i> and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">honesty</i>. It wouldn�t be
          right to spin the memo towards your client. You don�t want to pursue a
          case when there�s no chance to win.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Think out of the box! Use diligence! Do research to determine if you
          can make a case in a certain way. Figure out if it�s worthwhile to
          even bring the suit: are there actual damages? There might be a
          wrongdoer, but if there are no damages or slim damages it might not be
          worthwhile to bring a suit. Is it worth suing City Hall if you�re a
          contractor and half your business comes from the city?
          <span class="GramE">Maybe not.</span> You may not want to bite the
          hand that feeds you.</span

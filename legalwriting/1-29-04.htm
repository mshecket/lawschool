          >Okay! It�s time for class! There are some hard assignments. Maybe
          we�ll be getting out early today.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s do two exercises. The exercise in Chapter Five, Question Three,
          is to synthesize the rule from several cases. There are four cases.
          Let�s pull the law out of the fact patterns and decide what general
          rule we�re going to use when we have a case before us. It might be
          easier to do if there�s a specific case at hand.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In Chapter 7, we�ll do a rule explanation. We�ll do a set of facts.
          We�ll be given a case to use and we�ll try to pull the rule out of the
          case and just explain the rule of law. Then we�ll apply it to
          particular facts.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We�re building one layer on top of another as to what constitutes a
          memo: How do you get the rule of one case? How do you get the rule of
          several cases? How do you explain that rule? How do you apply the
          rule?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The expectation is that there will be different syntheses of the law.
          It�s not exactly but we have to do it. We take a bunch of cases and
          pull out those that are pertinent to a particular case.</span

          >Next week, we�ll get our writing assignment. We were trying to get
          through the material on how to do the writing assignment before we got

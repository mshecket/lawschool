        Former employee's complaint that he was discharged for refusing to
        participate in his former employer's scheme to defraud federal
        government by providing government with helicopters that were
        constructed using substandard and defective parts in violation of
        federal law adequately stated cause of action for wrongful discharge
        under public policy exception to employment at-will doctrine; former

        Quality control director and operations manager for producer of frozen
        food products brought action for damages arising out of his discharge
        from employment. The Superior Court, Judicial District of Hartford-New
        Britain at <st1:City><st1:place>Hartford</st1:place></st1:City
        >, O'Connell, J., granted employer's motion to strike complaint and
        rendered judgment for defendant, and employee appealed. The Supreme
        Court, Peters, J., held that director who was hired at will and who
        alleged that he had been dismissed in retaliation for his insistence
        that his employer comply with requirements of Food, Drug, and Cosmetics
        Act sufficiently alleged cause of action in tort for wrongful discharge

        Physician employed in research by pharmaceutical company filed complaint
        for alleged wrongful discharge. The Superior Court, Law Division,
        granted defendant's motion for summary judgment, and plaintiff appealed.
        The Superior Court, Appellate Division,
        <span class="GramE">166 <span class="SpellE">N.J.Super</span></span
        >. 335, 399 A.2d 1023, reversed and remanded, and defendant's petition
        for certification was granted. The Supreme Court, Pollock, J., held
        that: (1) employee at will has a cause of action for wrongful discharge
        when the discharge is contrary to a clear mandate of public policy;
        however, unless an employee identifies a specific expression of public
        policy, he may be discharged with or without cause, and (2) physician
        did not have a cause of action for wrongful discharge in opposing
        continued research on particular formulation of drug, where employee did
        not contend that ingredient in drug was harmful, but that it was
        controversial, where employee alleged that current controversy made
        continued investigation an unnecessary risk, but stopped work on the
        drug when there was no imminent risk, as human testing had not yet been
        approved by the FDA, and where, under the circumstances, the Hippocratic
        oath did not contain a clear mandate of public policy which prevented
        physician from continuing research.
      </p>

      <p>
        Judgment of Appellate Division reversed, and cause remanded to trial
        court for entry of judgment for defendant.

        Discharged airline mechanic brought two state court actions in
        <st1:State><st1:place>Hawaii</st1:place></st1:State
        >'s Circuit Court, one against airline and another against officials,
        alleging in part violation of public policy and state whistleblower act.
        The Circuit Court dismissed complaints in both actions and appeal was
        taken. The <st1:State><st1:place>Hawaii</st1:place></st1:State> Supreme
        Court, 74 <span class="GramE">Haw</span>. 235, 842 P.2d 634, 74 Haw.
        648, 847 P.2d 263, reversed in both cases. Certiorari was granted and
        cases were consolidated. The Supreme Court, Justice
        <span class="SpellE">Blackmun</span>, held that: (1) term
        &quot;grievances,&quot; as used in Railway Labor Act provision defining
        minor disputes subject to exclusive dispute resolution provisions of Act
        as disputes growing out of &quot;grievances&quot; or of interpretation
        or application of collection of collective bargaining agreements,
        referred to disagreements over how to give effect to bargained for
        agreement, and did not have broader preclusive effect; (2) state law
        cause of action is not preempted by Railway Labor Act if it involves
        rights and obligations existing independent of collective bargaining
        agreement; and (3) public policy and whistleblower claims of mechanic
        were independent of bargaining agreement and were not preempted by
        Railway Labor Act.

        Neither the Connecticut Family and Medical Leave Law nor the federal
        Family and Medical Leave Act gave rise to clear public policy mandate in
        favor of family friendly workplace policies, and as such, at-will

        criticizing employer's failure to implement its family policies, did not
        establish wrongful discharge claim under public policy exception to
        at-will employment doctrine.

        In determining whether a clear mandate of public policy has been
        violated such that an employer may be held liable in tort for his
        discharge of an at-will employee, court should inquire whether the
        employer's conduct contravenes the letter or purpose of a
        constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provision or scheme; prior
        judicial decisions may also establish the relevant public policy.

      <p>My free notes:</p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>
        Dr. Russo might be a little confused here. He has a few problems with
        his case that make it not fit in so well with the established categories
        <span class="GramE">that are</span> exceptions to the employment at-will
        doctrine. First of all, Russo didn�t really do anything. He didn�t
        really blow the whistle or alert anyone outside of his company of any
        illegal or improper actions. He simply refused to perform a particular
        action because he apparently thought it was wrong. Also, the guideline
        that his employer was asking him to break is not mandated by any
        statute, constitutional provision, or judicial opinion as far as we
        know. The guideline came from a private organization, not from the
        government. There is no political control over this organization.
        Instead, it is apparently overseen by the drug industry. So there�s no
        way that their procedures for human testing have any force of law unless
        a statute says so. But that�s unlikely because statutes that give up
        legislative responsibilities to other legislatures or private groups
        have been deemed unconstitutional in the past. But I don�t know if
        that�s a point that I�m supposed to talk about.
      </p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>
        If I were going to do this right, I would really have to search
        <st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State
        >�s statutes and regulations and see if Russo would have broken any
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">established</i> public policy by
        following orders.
      </p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>
        What is the effect of Russo�s past squabbles with his boss? I figure
        they are probably important or else they wouldn�t have been included in
        the facts of the case. Then again, maybe it�s a red herring to see if we
        can draw out just the important facts.
      </p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>
        The important cases are obviously
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Sheets</i> �and its progeny�. I
        think we�re supposed to explain how the later cases refine the rather
        vague endorsement of a cause of action for wrongful discharge that
        appears in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Sheets</i>.
      </p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>
        Should the law protect Russo if he doesn�t want to expose himself to a
        negligence suit later because he didn�t follow accepted research
        procedures?
      </p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>
        It may have been unwise to fire Russo, but are we really going to punish
        Empire Falls Pharmaceuticals? We�re not going to get entangled in the
        employer-employee relationship if we don�t have to. The public policy
        exception is narrow. We won�t make the company subject to liability that
        is unexpected.
      </p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>
        There is an exception to the doctrine of at-will employment. The
        question is whether Dr. Russo�s termination fits into that exception.

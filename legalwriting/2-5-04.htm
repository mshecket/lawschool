          >Okay! For today, on our syllabus, we�re doing the assignment for
          1/29, not 2/5. We�ll look at rule explanation and then rule
          application. These are the meatiest parts of the office memo. You ask
          yourself a question, figure out what the rule is from a case, explain
          the rule, and analyze the rule. We have a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">single-issue problem</i>, so we
          won�t have to deal with the kind of outlining that�s in the
          book.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So what we�ll do today, we�ll do what we were going to do next
          time.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Next week, we�ll talk about the status of our research. We should all
          have the cases before we do the final memo. Next week, she�ll bring in
          someone from Lexis-Nexis. She�ll have the problem and she�ll discuss
          how to research it. Between now and two weeks from now, we�ll need to
          have the working draft of our office memo. Then we�ll have individual
          conferences the following week to go over those drafts.</span

        <b><span>Explaining the rule</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Assume we�ve read Chapter 7 and that we�re ready to work on what we
          read. We have a rule explanation in the book. Throughout the rule
          explanation, the writer wants the reader to understand the key
          components of the rule. While you explain the rule, you do not talk
          about the case at hand. This is different than what we do on law
          school exams. We state the rule, but we don�t explain it on the exam.
          We go immediately into the analysis. It is assumed that our
          understanding of the rule will come out in our analysis.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s look at the exercises! One exercise is an outline of the rule
          explanation. First we outline the rule.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>Then we provide a description
          of the rule. That�s where the outline comes in. If we have a good rule
          outline, then we know what we need to use in order to explain the rule
          to the reader. The attorney needs to know the rule of law.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Don�t write an explanation together in our groups. Instead, decide
          what should be included in the explanation of the rule of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lucy v. Zimmer</i> given the
          facts of the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Ryan v. Kaplan</i> case.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We will use our rule explanation and outline as the foundation. So we
          have a rule in our example. We start out with the rule in general,
          then we fill it in which stuff specific to the case at hand. The
          analysis comes from comparing the facts of the case at hand with the
          facts in the case the rule comes from. You reason by analogy.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So let�s do the similarities and differences between the Kane hypo
          and the </span

          ><st1:place><span>Berry</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          case. Compare the facts! See what�s the same and what�s
          different!</span

      <br />

      <p><span>This is a learn-by-doing kind of thing!</span></p>

      <br />

      <p><span>Now we�re going to get ready to write a memo.</span></p>

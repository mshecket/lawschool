          proposing a persuasive question as opposed to a more objective
          question? We weren�t assigned the material on formulating a favorable
          rule. We <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">do </i>need to draft a
          persuasive work, though. We have to take the rule we�ve drafted and
          think about it from the client�s perspective. What questions will we

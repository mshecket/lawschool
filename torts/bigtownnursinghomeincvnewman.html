<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Facts: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Newman was admitted to the defendant’s nursing
home. Newman decided he wanted to leave
and made several attempts to do so. He
was forcibly restrained by the defendants. There was no court order for him to be restrained.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Issue:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> Did the nursing home falsely imprison Newman? If so, is the nursing home liable for
exemplary (punitive) damages?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Rule:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> False imprisonment occurs when one person directly
restrains another person’s physical freedom without legal justification. Punitive damages can be awarded if the
defendant intentionally violates the rights of the plaintiff.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Analysis: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>This is pretty cut and dried. If the plaintiff was crazy or had agreed to
be committed somehow, the nursing home could argue that they had some legal
justification.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Conclusion: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>The court upheld the verdict, but declared the damages
excessive and reduced them through a process called a <i>remittitur</i>.</span></p>

defendant has legal justification if his race track is private property. You ought to be able to choose who gets on
your property and who doesn’t. I guess
it would make a difference whether or not the ticket had the typical fine print
saying “we reserve the right to deny entry anytime to anybody for any
reason”. If the exclusion is on the
basis of race, it might be false imprisonment because you’re physically keeping
the person from getting into the race track but your justification is no longer
legal. Then again, you still might be
able to say that the racial discrimination plus the legitimate power to keep
people off your private property equates to “<i>adequate</i> legal
justification”.</span></span></p>

seems like based on the letter of the law there is no distinction made between
forcibly keeping someone <i>out</i> of a place versus forcibly keeping them <i>in</i>. Common sense would suggest, however, that
when we talk about <i>imprisonment</i> we mean you’re being locked in
somewhere.</span></span></p>

think there certainly could be false imprisonment in a moving automobile. If you get in a cab and the cab driver
refuses to let you out even though you paid and everything, it would be false
imprisonment even if you were moving. I
suppose false imprisonment would be possible in an entire city, but I don’t see
how it would be possible for a defendant to physically keep the plaintiff in
the city while allowing them to move around the city. Same with a whole state, because there aren’t
border guards at state borders. If it
were the whole country, it would be more realistic, since to get in or out of
this country you have to pass through some kind of security.</span></span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Custom can cut both ways: the judge will decide whether custom
          evidence comes in. If it gets in, it will usually resolve the case
          against the defendant if it shows that the defendant did not comply
          with custom. If the defendant <i>did</i> comply with custom, the
          defendant may not get off the hook if the custom itself is negligent.
          <i>Custom does not set the standard of care.</i></span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If there is a custom, we shall assume it is relatively easy and cheap
          to comply with; that is, we assume that customs don�t arise unless
          there are substantial dangers to be avoided.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Generally, children are judged against other children of like age.
          The only time we don�t follow that rule is when a child engages in an
          adult activity. Some courts will hold children engaged in an adult
          activity must satisfy the standard of care of a reasonable adult.
          Other courts find that children only must satisfy this standard when
          they participate in an inherently dangerous activity.</span

        <span
          >For example, if a nine-year-old drives a car and gets into an
          accident, to what standard shall we hold him to? You may argue that
          driving is an inherently dangerous activity because we can�t tell who
          is driving the car. You also may argue that the child should be held
          to a child�s standard.</span

          you can�t prove that you had a sudden bout of insanity, and we don�t
          want to have to sort out the truth of insanity pleas. We leave that to
          the criminal courts. It�s hard to distinguish

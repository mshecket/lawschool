        <b>Facts:</b> <st1:place>Western Union</st1:place> was appealing a
        decision in favor of Hill. Hill alleged that his wife was assaulted by
        Sapp, who worked for <st1:place>Western Union</st1:place>. Mrs. Hill
        came to the office where Sapp was working, and he made lewd remarks and
        allegedly tried to touch Mrs. Hill. Photos of the office show that the
        counter was too high and wide for Sapp to reach Hill unless Sapp stood
        on something or Mrs. Hill leaned over the counter.
      </p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p><b>Issue:</b> Did Sapp commit assault?</p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>
        <b>Rule:</b> An assault takes place when someone makes �an unlawful
        attempt to commit a battery�. The court says that �there must be an
        intentional, unlawful, offer to touch the person of another� and that
        the other person must have �a well-founded fear of an imminent battery�.
        Finally, the perpetrator must possess �the apparent present ability to
        effectuate the attempt�.
      </p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>
        <b>Analysis:</b> The court seems to find that it�s an open question for
        the jury whether or not it was physically possible to commit the
        threatened battery.
      </p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>
        <b>Conclusion:</b> The court finds there�s enough evidence to �justify
        an action for damages�. The court reverses the ruling against
        <st1:place>Western Union</st1:place> on the ground that Sapp wasn�t
        acting within the scope of his employment.

          On <i>Fuller v. State</i>, based on the rule in the present case, I
          think it would depend on whether the plaintiff interpreted the gesture
          as an offer to touch her. In the KKK case, I think the family members
          would have to prove they had a reasonable fear that the KKK members
          would actually shoot them and that they had the means to do so. Maybe
          they would have to prove the guns were loaded.
        </li>
        <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0.5in">
          The stone throwing running bastard: It would depend on what distance
          the guy could reasonably be expected to hit the other person.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>The test might be when the
          plaintiff is actually scared of getting hit. The interesting thing is
          that whether it was an assault would partly depend on how good a stone
          thrower the bastard is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>If
          this dude is Joe Montana, it would be assault a lot closer than if it
          was, say, an old lady.
        </li>
        <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0.5in">
          Bringing a gun to an interview: I think it would depend on the mores
          of the society at the time. Maybe in 1901 in
          <st1:country-region
            ><st1:place>Georgia</st1:place></st1:country-region
          >
          it was reasonable to carry guns around everywhere at all times, and
          carrying a gun didn�t necessarily mean you planned to use it soon, or
          ever. In today�s society, if you�re seen with a gun pretty much
          anywhere, people will be scared that you�re planning to shoot them
          <i>immediately</i>.
        </li>
        <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0.5in">
          Fear: I�m not sure how the court meant to use it here.<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes"
            >� </span
          >Sometimes fear can just mean suspicion. It�s hard to say someone
          hasn�t done something wrong just because the victim wasn�t
          afraid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>In terms of social
          policy, we want a potential assailant to be deterred from attacking
          <i>anybody</i>, even if they don�t know if they have a black belt or
          not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>But let�s say Mrs. Hill
          did have a black belt. If you use the court�s first definition of
          assault��an unlawful attempt to commit a battery, incomplete by reason
          of some intervening cause��then despite the black belt, assault
          certainly occurred. It�s just that the black belt was the intervening
          cause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>A lawyer might try to
          prove fear anyway because that might influence the jury in its
          decision about who wins and how much money they get.

          <i>Allen v. Hannaford</i>: if the gun isn�t loaded, that doesn�t mean
          there isn�t still the <i>apparent</i> present ability to batter.<span

            >� </span
          >I suppose it would be different if the target of the alleged assault
          knew that the gun was unloaded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"

          >Even so, if you brandish an unloaded gun at someone, that person
          might reasonably conclude you�re out to hurt them somehow, even if not

          >If a reasonable person would conclude that leaving a gun in your lap
          suggests you�re going to use it to blow somebody�s brains out, then
          that�s assault.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>If people
          leave guns on their lap all the time and no one thinks anything of it,
          then I think it�s not assault.

        <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0.5in">
          OK!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>That�s weird and

          This makes the distinction between criminal assault and the civil tort

        <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0.5in">
          I think the case references imply that if there is not an immediate
          threat, there�s no assault. �I�m going to blow you up with my mega
          super laser blaster that I haven�t invented yet!�<span
            style="mso-spacerun: yes"
            >� </span
          >I don�t think this would constitute assault even if you built the
          mega super blaster later and brandished it at the other person.

        <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0.5in">
          Okay, are these assault?

        <ol style="margin-top: 0in" start="1" type="A">
          <li style="mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: list 1in">
            I don�t think anything where you say �if it weren�t for this, I
            would do this� could be assault. You�re clearly implying to the
            person that you�re not planning on beating them up now.
          </li>
          <li style="mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: list 1in">
            Same deal. �If you weren�t an old man��<span

              >� </span
            >But apparently I am.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>So how
            I can reasonably fear being knocked down? I guess the thing with
            these first two cases is: how can you tell if the alleged assailant
            is being sincere?
          </li>
          <li style="mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: list 1in">
            Same deal again, but getting closer to the line.
          </li>
          <li style="mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: list 1in">
            This is tantamount to �I�m going to hit you�, I think.<span
              style="mso-spacerun: yes"
              >� </span
            >It would depend on how people interpreted this language at that
            time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>I think this would be
            assault though because it�s not a �If this were true than I�d hit
            you�.
          </li>
          <li style="mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1; tab-stops: list 1in">
            This is certainly another crime, but I don�t think it�s assault
            because it seems clearly implied that if you do pay the guy his
            money he will not take your life.
            <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>This sounds like robbery,
            though, but that�s not a tort, I don�t think.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0.5in">
          �Blow your brains out� vs. �hanky�: as far as the standard for assault
          speaks to the mental state of the plaintiff, the words here make a big
          difference. I have nothing to fear from a handkerchief, but a gun is
          going to make me quite reasonably scared.
        </li>
        <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 0.5in">
          No way! If I say these words, it�s not <i>me</i> that has the ability
          to carry out the potential battery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"
            >� </span
          >This certainly falls short.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span
          >From a policy standpoint, we certainly don�t want to forbid people
          from warning others of imminent danger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"
            >� </span
          >Then again, maybe the implication is that there really is no
          rattlesnake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Of course, if
          there is no assault, then all that�s left is words, and we already
          know from Note 8 that words can�t make an assault all by themselves.

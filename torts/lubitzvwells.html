      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Wells left a golf club sitting in his yard. His son picked it up and
          used it to hit a stone. He hit Lubitz with the club. Lubitz sued the
          elder Wells for leaving the club in his yard. The defendant demurred
          and said that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action against
          Wells.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> Is it negligence to leave a golf club lying in a yard?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          It is only negligence to leave an object lying around if it is
          �obviously and intrinsically dangerous�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court says that it is common sense that the golf club is not
          dangerous in and of itself.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The court sustains the demurrer.</span>

            the club is independent of his father�s rejected duty to not leave
            golf clubs on his lawn. If the son is found (1) to have such a duty,
            (2) to have breached it, (3) to have caused harm, and (4) to have
            caused actual damages, then the son could be found negligent
            independent of the father. If the plaintiff had tripped over the
            golf club, she would have alleged the breach of a different duty,
            namely, the duty to keep one�s lawn free from debris that someone
            could trip over. If such an obligation is recognized by law, the
            plaintiff could have a cause of action.</span

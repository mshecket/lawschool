        <span>Supreme Court of </span
        ><st1:State

        ><span>, 1998.</span>
      </p>

      <p><span>716 So.2d 783.</span></p>

      <p><span>Prosser, pp. 232-236</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The plaintiff was driving behind a tractor-trailer driven by the
          defendant when its spare tire came off and hit the plaintiff�s
          windshield. The plaintiff sued and won at trial when the judge
          instructed the jury on res ipsa loquitor. The defendant appealed and
          had the judgment overturned. Then the plaintiff appealed.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> Does res ipsa loquitor apply to the facts of this case?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Res ipsa loquitor applies when (1) the thing that caused the injury
          was in the exclusive control of the defendant, and (2) the accident
          wouldn�t have happened without someone being negligent.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that the spare tire coming loose is the sort of
          accident that can only be caused by negligence and that the person who
          was in charge of keeping the spare tire from flying off was the
          defendant.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court vacates the judgment of the appeals court and orders that
          the trial court verdict be reinstated.</span

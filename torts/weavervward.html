      <p>Prosser, p. 5</p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>
        Facts: Weaver and Ward were soldiers involved in an exercise.&nbsp; Ward
        shot his musket and hurt Weaver.&nbsp; Weaver is suing for trespass of
        assault and battery.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        Issue: Can a plaintiff collect damages if a defendant hurt him or her by
        accident?
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        Rule: As long as you were hurt or experienced a loss, you can collect on
        a trespass action, <i>except</i> if the defendant is found to be
        <i>utterly without fault</i>.&nbsp; The defendant has the burden to
        prove that he or she wasn�t at fault, for example, that the accident was
        <i>inevitable</i>.&nbsp; (I don�t know how this comes out of the ruling,
        but it�s in the notes.)
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        Analysis: The court makes the distinction between whether an act is a
        crime (felony) and whether it can be considered trespass. The court also
        gets into some kind of distinction between excuse and justification that
        I don�t understand at all.
      </p>

      <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

      <p>Conclusion: The defendant was found to be liable.</p>

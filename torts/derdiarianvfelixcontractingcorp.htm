<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Dickens lost consciousness while
driving and hit the plaintiff, a subcontractor at a construction site. The plaintiff sued Dickens and the
construction company, the latter on the theory that they negligently failed to maintain
a safe work site. The plaintiff
prevailed at trial. The defendant appealed,
claiming that the accident was unforeseeable and thus that they should bear no liability.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Was the conduct of the
construction company the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s harm?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> The defendant will not be
held liable if the intervening act of the third party is not a foreseeable
consequence of the defendant’s negligence.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court finds that it is
not unforeseeable that negligently failing to secure a work site near a road
might result in a driver entering the site and hurting someone. The court says that the question was properly
left up to a jury.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The judgment of the lower court
is affirmed.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Prosser, p. 32-33</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Facts: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>The plaintiff was approached while standing with a
plate. One of the defendant’s employees
snatched the plate out of his hand and made a racist remark. The plaintiff was not touched and didn’t
suffer physical injury, but was hurt emotionally.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Procedural Posture: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>The jury in the trial found for the plaintiff and
awarded damages. The trial court set
aside the verdict and found for the defendants. The Court of Civil Appeals upheld the ruling, and the plaintiff appealed
to the Texas Supreme Court.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Issue: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Can a plaintiff have a cause for battery if he or she
was neither touched nor in apprehension of physical injury?</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Rule: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>The basis of an action for battery is the “unpermitted
and intentional invasion of the plaintiff’s <i>person</i> and not the actual <i>harm
</i>done to the plaintiff’s <i>body</i>”.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Analysis: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>The court appeals to other cases where similar
situations arose in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, as well as the Restatement of Torts §18. The rule as given in <i>Morgan v. Loyacomo</i>
is clear in saying that “it is not necessary to touch the plaintiff’s body or
even his clothing; knocking or snatching anything from the plaintiff’s body or
touching anything connected with his person, when done in an offensive manner,
is sufficient.”</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The court says that “<i>personal
indignity</i>” is the <i>essence</i> of battery, so it doesn’t matter whether
or not there was physical contact or injury.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Conclusion: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>The court held that snatching the plate away from the
plaintiff constituted battery and that the plaintiff was entitled to damages
for mental suffering, “even in the absence of any physical injury”. The court reversed the judgments of the lower
courts and awarded damages to the plaintiff.</span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span dir=LTR><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Even
if there hadn’t been a racial epithet used, the plaintiff still would have
prevailed under this court’s reasoning. It didn’t matter that something mean or offensive was said while the
action was performed. The action <i>in
itself</i> was offensive. If there had
only been the racial epithet, battery would not lie because there would be no
contact whatsoever and thus no invasion of the plaintiff’s <i>person</i>. In the case of the doorman kicking the
plaintiff’s car, it depends on whether one’s car is “customarily regarded as
part of the other’s person” (according to Restatement). It would be hard to argue that your car is
part of your person when you’re not inside it or standing near it.</span></span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span dir=LTR><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Using
the tort of battery does seem to dilute the meaning of that tort. The plaintiff’s attorney might have chosen to
attempt to sue for battery because he or she thought the plaintiff could get
more money that way. Is this
“imaginative lawyering”? That’s kind of
a loaded term. If the plaintiff deserved
compensation, then you could argue the lawyer was just doing his or her best to
get that compensation. I don’t know what
other remedies would be available because we have not studied them yet. Maybe <a href="assault.html">assault</a>?</span></span></p>

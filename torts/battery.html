<p><b>Case: </b><i><a href="colevturner.html">Cole v. Turner</a></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965)</b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>This restatement is different from what Chief Justice Holt
said. Here, battery is defined as action
with intent to touch someone and cause harm or offense <i>or</i> the
apprehension of harmful or offensive contact; <i>plus</i>, the harmful contact
actually happens, but <i>not necessarily</i> as a direct result of that
action. Wacky!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Oh wait, there’s more. If the batterer acts intending to cause…the same stuff as before…and <i>offensive</i>
contact directly or indirectly results, then you have battery. <i>But</i>, if the act was done without
intent, you’re not liable for battery just for offensive contact. It says you might be negligent or reckless,
though.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Oh crap, I almost missed it…if the intent was to cause harm
or offense to a <i>third person</i>, and the person misses and hits somebody
else…still battery!</p>

<p><u>Notes and Questions</u></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>One
     big change is that it’s not merely <i>any</i> contact, but harmful or
     offensive contact that counts toward battery.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, there can be somewhat of a
     disconnect between the intent of the act and the result of the act.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>E.g. if you were attempting to touch the
     person in touch a way as to <i>harm</i> them, but ended up merely touching
     them in an <i>offensive</i> way, that’s still battery.</li>
 <li style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>The
     idea here is if you give someone a noogie and fracture their skull in the
     process, you’re liable for fracturing their skull even if there was no
     reasonable expectation of that level of harm.</li>
 <li style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>I don’t
     think this would qualify as battery because there was no intent to cause
     harmful or offensive contact or apprehension of the same.</li>
 <li style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Sure,
     if the defendant is trying to help the plaintiff, then again, there is no
     intent to cause harmful or offensive contact, etc.</li>
 <li style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>I
     understand why this is an open question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
     </span>The Restatement doesn’t say who should be the judge of what is
     harmful or offensive. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>If the
     defendant acted to cause contact that he/she <i>knew</i> the plaintiff
     considered offensive or harmful, you could argue that it is battery
     because the defendant is doing something that he/she <i>knows</i> will
     cause the plaintiff psychic discomfort.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
     </span>On the other hand, if I sincerely believe that I am causing <i>non-harmful,
     non-offensive</i> contact, maybe I would argue the prohibition is not
     reasonable.</li>
 <li style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Based
     on the Restatement, it appears that such a battery is possible because the
     plaintiff’s awareness never enters into it.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If their being unaware makes the contact
     not offensive or not harmful, it could make a difference.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if Sleeping Beauty found being kissed
     by Prince Charming to be offensive after the fact, I think she would have
     a cause of action (if it’s the plaintiff who determines what’s offensive).<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If she didn’t find it harmful or
     offensive (including the sheer fact it was done while she was out of it),
     then the Prince wouldn’t be liable for battery…assuming <i>he</i> meant
     well. As far as the unauthorized
     operation goes, again, the difference seems to be whether the plaintiff
     finds the operation offensive, and if it was meant to be offensive.</li>
 <li style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>I
     think this one rests on intent. It
     would matter whether or not you knew you were infected and
     contagious. Sexual activity when
     you’re contagious with an STD could well be considered harmful
     contact. I don’t know whether it
     would matter if you had sex <i>because</i> you wanted to harm the other
     person. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>You can say with sexual
     activity that you intended to act to cause <i>a</i> contact, and on top of
     that the contact <i>was harmful</i>, but I don’t know if that adds up to <i>harmful
     contact</i> as in the Restatement.</li>
 <li style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Ooooh…hmmm.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don’t think a dead body can intend
     anything. I suppose the executor of
     the estate of the deceased or whoever it is that got the body into the
     mortician’s hands without telling him or her it was infected might intend
     to cause harm. Or again, <i>to
     cause some contact</i> which incidentally <i>is harmful</i>.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s probably a bunch of cases that
     make these distinctions. The action
     could only be against someone capable of the intention of causing contact
     with the body. I don’t know if
     there is a cause for action only if the mortician <i>contracts</i> HIV, or
     if the Mortician is merely <i>exposed</i> to HIV, <i>risks </i>contracting
     it. As for the dentist, I think you’d
     have a much better case for negligence, but if you wanted to go for
     battery, it would again hinge on whether it was that the dentist intended
     to cause contact (he certainly did) that was harmful or offensive (maybe)…versus
     the dentist <i>intended</i> to cause <i>harm through the contact</i>.</li>

        ><span></span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Supreme Court of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Iowa</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>, 1971.</span>
      </p>

      <p><span>183 N.W.2d 657.</span></p>

      <p><span>Prosser, p. 105-108</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Brineys set up a spring-loaded gun to protect against trespassers.
          It blew Katko�s leg off. Katko sued for personal injury and won. The
          defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new
          trial and were refused. They appealed to the Iowa Supreme Court.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Does an owner have the privilege of protecting personal property with
          a spring gun?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          You do not have the privilege to use force that may cause death or
          serious injury against trespassers unless the trespass itself
          threatens death or serious injury.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court reasons that the Brineys knew the power of the shotgun and
          gave no notice to any potential trespasser that the gun was there or
          where exactly on the property it was located. Furthermore, the
          property was unoccupied and neither death nor serious injury was
          threatened by any trespasser.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The court upheld the verdict.</span>

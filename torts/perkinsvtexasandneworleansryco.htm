        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          There was a train-car accident where both parties were negligent. The
          train was going too fast and the car was negligent in driving the car
          in front of the train. The decedent of the passenger of the car sued
          the railroad and won at trial. The appellate court affirmed. The
          railroad appealed to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.</span

        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          The court says that the negligence of the railroad was an actual cause
          of the accident if the accident would not have happened �<i>but for</i
          >� that negligence. The negligent conduct in question was running the
          train at 37 mph as opposed to the 25 mph prescribed by the railroad�s
          own rules.</span

          found to be the actual cause of the collision if the collision
          <i>would not have happened</i> if the train had been going the proper
          speed of 25 mph.</span

          >The court weighs the evidence and finds that if the train had been
          going the proper speed, the collision would have happened anyway.

          cause-in-fact of the collision.</span

          that claims that if the train had been going slower, the driver of the
          car <i>might</i> have had enough time to get away. The court says that
          this is not supported by evidence, and is in fact �pure
          conjecture�.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Bacon and Gentry were at a ranch. Bacon was carrying his rifle around
          when he stumbled near (or on) some steps and accidentally fired and
          killed Gentry. Gentry�s decedent sued Bacon, but he went bankrupt. The
          plaintiff also sued the ranch for negligence in maintaining the
          stairs.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> Were the defendants negligent as a matter of law?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          There must be proof of causation in order for a negligence action to
          lie. Furthermore, mere speculation or suspicion is not enough to
          �sustain an action or to defeat a motion for summary judgment�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that there is insufficient evidence in the record for
          the theory that Bacon accidentally fired the gun because he tripped on
          the stairs. The court says this is mere speculation, and thus it�s not
          enough to overcome the motion for summary judgment. The court finds
          that the lower court was correct in ruling that as a matter of law the
          ranch owners were not negligent based on the facts presented.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The motion for summary judgment is upheld.</span>
      </p>

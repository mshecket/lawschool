A paper would identify the issues correctly, would identify the elements of

something isn’t there if it really isn’t there. Judgment is very important on law school exams.</span></p>

your common sense. Interpret everything

<p><b><span>Medical
malpractice</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Custom
is important to the determination of a medical malpractice case. It’s almost dispositive in such cases. In most areas, custom alone is not evidence,
but in medical malpractice, it is feared that juries don’t know enough to decide
if malpractice happened. We’re not sure
if this is a fair result.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Outside
of the medical profession, custom is not controlling or necessarily even
admissible.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
it logical to think that doctors get a slightly better standard for themselves
because they have professional obligations that prevent them from setting a
lower standard to serve other interests?<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2'

<br/>

<p><span>Do
doctors have an incentive to collectively lower their standards to keep from
being liable?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
other professions, we do not allow their own custom to state the standard. Why don’t we do that with doctors? Should doctors be given more freedom?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Should
we judge doctors against other doctors from their own community or against <i>national</i>
standards? If we judge rural doctors
against rural doctors in the same community, who will we be able to get to
testify against Doctor #1 if there are only two doctors in town? Is there the threat of a “conspiracy of
silence”?</span></p>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="morrisonvmacnamara.htm">Morrison v. MacNamara</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Morrison
went to a medical laboratory for a urethral smear test. The test was done while he was standing up,
and during the test he had an adverse reaction and got injured. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Morrison sued, arguing that the lab should be
held to a national standard of care. The
defendants argued that they should be held to a local standard of care.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court rules that nationally certified medical professionals should be held to
the national standard of care.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="scottvbradford.htm">Scott v. Bradford</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Scott
is claiming that if she had been given the right information she would not have
consented to the surgery.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
do we judge whether the doctor failed in his duty to provide information? Is it enough in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> for me to say “if I had
known what I know now I wouldn’t have gone through with it”?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
is the so called “reasonable doctor” standard and the “reasonable patient”
standard. Who testifies in a “reasonable
doctor” jurisdiction? A doctor testifies
as to what doctors would do.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
a “reasonable patient” jurisdiction, it’s a little trickier because it’s hard
to contemplate such a thing as a “patient expert”. In this case, you use a “reasonable man” or “reasonable
person” standard.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Are
there any other tests?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
would seem that the patient loses his right to self-determination if he would
have declined where a reasonable patient would have consented. The court adopts the so-called “subjective
patient standard”. The court says that
the patient can say what they would have said and it’s up to the jury to
consider the credibility of the plaintiff.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Next
time, we will consider what the best standard is.</span></p>

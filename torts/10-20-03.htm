          of the least likely. The plaintiff would argue that it is a very

          cancer. He was negligently misdiagnosed. It is assumed that the
          failure to diagnose caused a 14 percent decrease in his chance of
          survival. The question is whether, more likely than not, you lost your

          It is fair to not allow anyone to collect if they have less than a 50
          percent chance of surviving overall? The court disagrees with this
          rule. It argues that the negligent misdiagnosis is a

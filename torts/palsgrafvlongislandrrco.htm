<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> A guy with a box was
rushing to get on a train. One of the railroad’s
employees gave him a shove, and he dropped a non-descript package which turned
out to be filled with fireworks. KERPLEWIE! Somehow, it is
alleged, the explosion knocked down a scale (like you use to weigh stuff) and
hit the plaintiff. The plaintiff sues
for her injuries based on the theory that the railroad’s employee was negligent.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Is there such a thing as
transferred negligence?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> There must be a wrong in
order for there to be liability for negligence.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> Justice Cardozo says that
this is <i>not</i> a causation issue.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
a dissenting opinion, Justice Andrews writes that this case is really an issue
of proximate cause. He finds that the
guard’s negligence actually <i>was</i> the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s
injury.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The judgment of the lower
courts was reversed and the plaintiff got nothing.</span></p>

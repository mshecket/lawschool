          >The defendants beat up the plaintiff�s father in front of the
          plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that this caused her severe emotional
          distress and sued. The defendants demurred and the suit was dismissed.
          The plaintiff appealed the dismissal.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b

          Can a witness to a battery state a cause of action for intentional
          infliction of mental distress?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          In order for the defendants to be liable for intentional infliction of
          mental distress, the beating must be done for the purpose of causing
          the plaintiff mental distress, or else the defendants must possess
          substantial certainty that the beating will cause the plaintiff
          substantial distress.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court found that the claim failed to allege that either condition
          for intentional infliction of mental distress was met.</span

      </p>

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b

        <b><span>Facts: </span></b
        ><span
          >The plaintiff owned land near the defendant�s copper smelter. Gases
          and particles from the smelter landed on the plaintiff�s land. The
          plaintiff sued for trespass to land as well as nuisance. Both parties
          filed for summary judgment.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue: </span></b
        ><span
          >Can trespass lie when it does not involve anything visible to the
          naked eye?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule: </span></b
        ><span
          >Even the slightest bit of harm, including �by the vibration of the
          soil or by the concussion of the air� constitutes trespass.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court says that modern science insists that little particles can
          land on other peoples� land, and that this is trespass. The court goes
          on to say that trespass and nuisance are not mutually exclusive. It is
          stated that a plaintiff must show �actual and substantial damages� in
          order to withstand a summary judgment motion.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion: </span></b
        ><span
          >The case was remanded to the United States District Court for the
          Western District of Washington, which granted American Smelting�s
          motion for summary judgment due to the low levels of pollutants found
          in the plaintiff�s soil.</span

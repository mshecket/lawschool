          ><st1:place><span>New Hampshire</span></st1:place></st1:State

      </p>

      <p><span>95 N.H. 318, 63 A.2d 233.</span></p>

      <p><span>Prosser, p. 72-73</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          A little girl, Elaine Glidden, played with a dog and pulled its ears.
          The dog snapped at her nose and she was injured. She sued for personal
          injury and won. The defendants argued that the girl was committing
          trespass to chattels at the time of the injury, and thus Elaine was
          barred from recovering damages for her injury.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue: </span></b
        ><span
          >Could Elaine Glidden be held liable for trespass to chattels against
          the defendants� dog?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Someone cannot be held liable for trespass to chattels unless some
          harm comes to the chattel.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds no evidence in the record to show that Elaine injured
          the dog. Therefore, the court concludes Elaine did not commit a tort
          at the time of her injury.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The court upheld the verdict against the defendants.</span>

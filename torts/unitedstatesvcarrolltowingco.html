>Co.</span></i></st1:place><span></span></p>

<p><span>United
States Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, 1947.</span></p>

<p><span>159
F.2d 169.</span></p>

<p><span>Prosser,
pp. 139-141</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Conners Co.’s workers were
absent from their barge, the <i>Anna C</i>. Carroll owned a tugboat whose workers caused the barge to come lose and
eventually sink. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> sought compensation for its
flour that was on board and Conners sought compensation for the barge. The trial court divided the damages between
Conners and Carroll because it found Conners was responsible for not having a
worker on the <i>Anna C</i> at the time.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> If no one is working on a
barge and the barge causes injuries to others, is the owner of the barge
liable?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> No rule! Just some general guidelines to determine the
bargee’s duty.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> Learned Hand says that the
owner’s duty depends on three variables:</span></p>

that the barge will break away from its moorings?</span></span></p>

injury did it cause?</span></span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span
dir=LTR><span>How expensive
would precautions be?</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the expense of precautions is less the expectation value of the injury, then
the court will conclude that the owner had a duty that was breached.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The court finds that there
should have been a bargee aboard during working hours. Thus, Conners is partly responsible for the
harm caused.</span></p>

case, Hand acts as though the three factors are quantifiable, and he actually
does the algebra and comes up with an answer. I actually think that in fact a judge is better equipped to make these
judgments than a jury.</span></span></p>

moderate and P is very small where L is fairly high. This wouldn’t be an easy case, but I think
the fact that the harm is very unlikely and unforeseeable wins out.</span></span></p>

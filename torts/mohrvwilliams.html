<p><span>Supreme
Court of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, 1905.</span></p>

<p><span>95 </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

<p><span>Prosser,
p. 91-94</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> A doctor examined the
plaintiff and found a problem with her right ear, requiring surgery, but
nothing wrong with the left ear. After
putting the plaintiff under anesthesia, the doctor found the right ear didn’t
need to be operated upon, while the left ear had a serious condition that
needed surgery, which he successfully performed. The plaintiff sued for battery and won. The trial court granted a motion for a new
trial on the basis of excessive damages, and both parties appealed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Can implied consent be
construed on the part of the plaintiff?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> Any unlawful touching of
the plaintiff constitutes battery unless it is necessary.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court finds that the
patient did not give implied consent for the surgery on the left ear, and that
even though there wasn’t wrongful intent, there was still technical battery.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The order for a new trial
was affirmed.</span></p>

the person is more or less nuts, I don’t think they have a legal duty to do the
thing they’re being told not to do. On
the other hand, they may be liable for a tort if they perform the operation
without consent.</span></span></p>

used. There probably shouldn’t be more
than two or at most three levels of consent.</span></span></p>

own minds at a younger age.</span></span></p>

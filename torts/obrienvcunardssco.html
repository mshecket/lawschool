        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          A passenger on a steamship got vaccinated. Subsequently, she suffered
          injuries that she claimed were related to the vaccination.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>She sued the steamship company
          for assault and negligence. The trial court gave a directed verdict
          for the defendants, and the plaintiff appealed.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Can a defendant be held liable for an intentional tort if the
          plaintiff consented to the contact?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          If the plaintiff�s behavior indicated that she consented, then the
          physician�s act was justified.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court says that the doctor was right to assume that he had the
          right to vaccinate unless there was a specific objection.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>The court reasons that since
          the woman never objected to the vaccination, the doctor could not have
          known that she didn�t want to be vaccinated.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court upheld the trial court�s ruling for a directed verdict for
          the defendant.</span

            the nose. In the present case, there are a lot of circumstances to
            support implied consent, while in the case of getting punched in the
            nose, there are none, unless you are engaged in a
            getting-punched-in-the-nose contest.</span

            >If the woman is his fianc�e, I think it is typical, at least in our
            culture, that consent to kiss (if nothing else) is implied. If it�s
            the first date, I think evidence would have to be presented to the
            jury in regard to the events of the evening and the state of mind of
            the man and woman. For example, if he had already kissed her with
            consent 50 times that night, it would be hard to imagine that
            consent did not exist for kiss #51. On the other hand, if the date
            had just started, or hadn�t gone so well, battery might be more
            likely to lie. In the case of the stranger, battery would be easier
            to prove, however, it would be most surprising if the plaintiff did
            not object in any way.</span

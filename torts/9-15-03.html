          ><a href="9-10-03.html">Last time</a>, we talked about
          <a href="defenseofproperty.html">defense of property</a> and mentioned
          that people can�t do <i>indirectly </i>what they�re not allowed to do
          <i>directly</i>. Thus, spring guns and the like are <i>illegal</i>, or
          more properly, if someone is hurt by one <i>you will be liable</i>.
          The problem is that machines do not have discretion like people do.
          The goal is to have safe ways to protect your property that provide
          notice of their danger, for example, barbed wire.</span

          a circumstantial decision made case-by-case by a defendant and judged

          Amendment only applies to the federal government and not the states.

          who is trespassing on your property. Therefore, the defendant can�t
          put the plaintiff in great danger. On the other hand, if it was just a
          boat moored to a dock and the defendant pushed it out to sea, we are
          weighing harm to one person�s property against the harm to another
          person�s property. How could you assess whether or not the plaintiff
          in this case had a necessity defense? Are there any instances in which
          the defendant would be justified in pushing the plaintiff�s boat off
          the dock?</span

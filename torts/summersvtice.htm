        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Two guys were trying to shoot a quail but missed and one of them hit
          the plaintiff. Nobody knows which one, but one and only one defendant
          hit the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued and won verdicts at trial
          against both defendants.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Can both defendants be held liable when only one was in fact
          responsible?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Both defendants may be held liable if both were negligent.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          As a matter of policy, confusion over who dunnit should not bar
          recovery by the plaintiff. Since the court finds that both defendants
          were negligent and thus both in the wrong, it is not considered unfair
          to make them both pay. The court argues that if one was more
          responsible than the other, they should fight it out amongst
          themselves.</span

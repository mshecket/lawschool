Court of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Vermont</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, 1846.</span></p>

<p><span lang=FR style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The plaintiff bought a
stove on credit and started taking it away. The defendants found out that the plaintiff had bad credit and went to
take back the stove. They took it back
by force and, in the course of doing so, the plaintiff pulled a knife on
them. The plaintiff sued for assault and
battery and conversion of the stove. The
trial court found for the plaintiff for $1. The defendants appealed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Do property owners have the
privilege of taking back their property by force when it is taken from them
fraudulently?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> Property owners have the
right to recover chattel if it can be done “without unnecessary violence to the
person, or without breach of the peace”. Furthermore, “there is no privilege on the part of the wrongdoer to
resist”.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court focuses on the
fact that the plaintiff drew a knife, at which point he became the aggressor. The plaintiff should not have resisted the defendants’
repossessing of the ill-gotten goods. If
the plaintiff hadn’t resisted, there would have been no force necessary to
recapture the chattel. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Therefore, the defendants’
contact was privileged.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The judgment of the trial
court is reversed.</span></p>

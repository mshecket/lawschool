        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Morrison went in to a medical laboratory have a urethral smear test.
          It was done with him standing up, and he fainted and seriously hurt
          himself. At trial, the plaintiff presented expert testimony from out
          of town that suggested that having the test done standing up did not
          meet the <i>national</i> standard of care of having the patient seated
          or prone, as evinced by expert witnesses. The defendant medical
          laboratory had its own expert witnesses who was local and who said
          that the <i>local</i> standard of care was to have the patient
          standing up. The plaintiff�s expert testimony was disallowed in court.
          The jury found for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Should the defendant be subject to the local standard of care or the
          national standard of care?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          NEW RULE! The defendant must exercise the �degree of reasonable care
          and skill expected of members of the medical profession under the same
          or similar circumstances�. The locality rule says that doctors should
          only be measured against other doctors in their community. This court
          abandons the locality rule for the first time in this
          jurisdiction.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The locality rule came about because it was reasonable to expect that
          doctors in big cities would be able to provide a higher standard of
          care than rural doctors.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court says that the locality rule is outdated because medical
          standards have been nationalized and there is no longer any reason to
          expect that health care in rural areas as a matter of course will be
          inferior to health care in big cities.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court concludes that the defendant medical laboratory must be
          held to a national standard of care.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court vacated the judgment for the defendants and ordered a new
          trial.</span

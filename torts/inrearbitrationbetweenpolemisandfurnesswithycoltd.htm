        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The plaintiffs� boat was destroyed and they sued the defendants for
          the entire value of the boat. The defendants claimed that the damages
          were too remote to be foreseeable and thus that the defendants were
          not the proximate cause of the damages. The arbitrators found that the
          plaintiff�s ship was destroyed by fire, that the fire was caused by a
          spark igniting gasoline vapor, and that in turn the spark was caused
          by a falling board. The arbitrators found that damage of this
          magnitude was not reasonably foreseeable, though the falling board was
          the result of the defendants� negligence and at least
          <i>some</i> damage was foreseeable. The arbitrators awarded heavy
          damages to the plaintiffs. The defendants appealed.</span

        <b><span>Rule:</span></b

          The defendants will only be held responsible for the proximate (i.e.
          not too remote) results of their negligence.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The judges find that the damage was not too remote from the negligence
          to bar recovery by the plaintiff.</span

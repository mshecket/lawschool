          Former staffers of Senator Dodd secretly took files from his office,
          photocopied them, and then replaced them. Dodd sues the newspaper
          columnists who published articles based on those files for conversion
          and invasion of privacy. The District Court granted partial summary
          judgment to Dodd on the conversion theory. The case went to the DC
          Circuit on interlocutory appeal.</span

          The court says that the documents themselves couldn�t have been
          converted, because they were returned in useable condition. The court
          then considers whether the documents could be considered intellectual
          property that could be compromised by being merely seen and then
          returned. The court decides that the records that were copied,
          consisting of letters from constituents and office documents, are not
          intellectual property.</span

            conversion. Either way, the doctors are completely depriving the
            plaintiff of the use of the spleen, such as it is. We might suppose,
            however, that if the spleen were being removed as part of treatment
            for a disease, it had no value to the plaintiff or even negative
            value. I don�t think the plaintiff would have a case under the tort
            of conversion, but they might be able to sue for something else. On
            the other hand, I suppose the plaintiff could argue that the doctors
            and commercial developer deprived the patient of the use of the
            cells that turned out to be valuable. The defendants could then
            argue that if they had to pay for the patient�s cells, they would
            have used someone else�s cells. What about next of kin�s property
            interest in body parts of a corpse? In a way, the corpse of someone
            is a chattel that is useful to the decedent�s family. For many
            people, burying the body intact is helpful to put closure on the
            person�s death. Therefore, for the same reason that you could
            convert a coffin, I think conversion could lie with a corpse.</span

<p><i><span>Slocum
v. Food Fair Stores of </span></i><st1:State><st1:place><i><span
 >Florida</span></i></st1:place></st1:State><i><span></span></i></p>

<p><span>Supreme
Court of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, 1958.</span></p>

<p><span>100
So.2d 396.</span></p>

<p><span>Prosser,
p. 51-53</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:
</span></b><span>An employee
of the defendant insulted the plaintiff while she was inquiring about a price
of an item in the defendant’s store. The
plaintiff claimed that the language caused her to suffer a heart attack and
other injuries. The defendant moved to
dismiss the suit based on failure to state a cause of action. The motion was granted, and the plaintiff
appealed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Does insulting language
constitute a violation of a legally protected right? In other words, does it constitute a tort <i>in
itself</i>?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> An action for intentional
infliction of mental distress may lie if the distress is severe, or if an
insult is suffered by a patron of a common carrier such as an employee of a
hotel, theater, or telegraph office.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court asserts that a
line should be drawn between emotional distress that is severe and distress
that is not severe. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The line that the court
chooses is that “there is liability only for conduct exceeding all bounds which
could be tolerated by society”. The court
further determines that mere vulgar insults do not exceed such bounds.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The motion to dismiss is affirmed.</span></p>

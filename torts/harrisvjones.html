<p><i><span>Harris
v. Jones</span></i></p>

<p><span>Court
of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, 1977.</span></p>

<p><span>281
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Md.</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> 560, 380 A.2d 611.</span></p>

<p><span>Prosser,
p. 54-57</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Harris was teased by Jones
for his stuttering. Harris claimed that
the teasing worsened the condition and caused him emotional distress. The jury found for the plaintiff, but was
overruled in the Court of Special Appeals. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Was the emotional distress
suffered by the plaintiff “severe”?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> An action for intentional
infliction of mental distress must contain four elements: (1) intentional or
reckless conduct, (2) extreme and outrageous conduct, (3) a causal connection
between the conduct and the distress, (4) distress that can be considered severe.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court argues that in
deciding whether the distress was severe, the situation can’t be studied in a
vacuum. Because the plaintiff had
problems that preceded his employment and the place of employment was kind of a
rough place, there hadn’t been enough evidence introduced that the distress
could be considered severe.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:
</span></b><span>The court affirmed
the reversal of the Court of Special Appeals.</span></p>

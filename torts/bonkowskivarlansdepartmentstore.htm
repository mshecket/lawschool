<p><span>Court
of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, 1968.</span></p>

<p><span>12
Mich.App. 88, 162 N.W.2d 347.</span></p>

<p><span>Prosser,
pp. 113-115</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The plaintiff sued a store
where she had been detained on suspicion of shoplifting. </span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> </span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> NEW RULE! A shopkeeper is privileged to detain a
customer for a “reasonable investigation of the facts” if the shopkeeper has a
reasonable belief that the customer has unlawfully taken goods from the store.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court decides to extend
the rule of the Restatement Second §120 A because a shopkeeper may not have
enough time to form a “reasonable belief” to start a “reasonable investigation”
before the customer has left the store. The court says that more information should be gathered about whether
the store security guard had a <i>reasonable</i> belief that the plaintiff had
stolen from the store.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The court reversed and
remanded the case for a new trial.</span></p>

dir=LTR><span>There is a
cost-benefit analysis here that the court seems to ignore. It seems as though the extent of the
shopkeeper’s privilege should be relative to the value of the goods taken. If a pack of gum is stolen from Meijer, there
is very little harm to the shopkeeper or to other customers. If jewelry or fancy golf clubs are stolen,
the loss to the shopkeeper and to customers may be great. The extent of the privilege should also
depend on how frequently shoplifting occurs.</span></span></p>

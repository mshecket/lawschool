<p><i><span>Talmage
v. Smith</span></i><span></span></p>

<p><span>Supreme
Court of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, 1894.</span></p>

<p><span>101
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Mich.</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> 370, 59 N.W. 656.</span></p>

<p><span>Prosser,
p. 28-29</span></p>

<p><span><br>
<b>Facts:</b> Smith found some boys sitting on several sheds on his
property. He went up to one of the sheds
and saw two boys on the roof. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He told
them to get down, and the two boys he saw started to climb down. The defendant then threw a stick in the
direction of these boys, and it hit Talmage, whom the defendant did not see,
injuring his eye severely.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Can Smith be held liable
for trespass against Talmage if he intended to hit someone else?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> If the defendant intends to
hit somebody, the defendant will be liable for hitting anybody.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:
</span></b><span>The court
evaluates the propriety of the trial court’s instructions to the jury and finds
them to be acceptable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:
</span></b><span>The
appellate court upheld the trial court’s judgment.</span></p>

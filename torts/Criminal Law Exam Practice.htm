     style='font-size:12.0pt'>Voluntary act</span></u><span style='font-size:
     12.0pt'> – Under the Model Penal Code § 2.01, a person is not guilty of an
     offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary
     act. In this case, <span
     class=SpellE>Eulo’s</span> willed bodily movement in pulling the trigger

     style='font-size:12.0pt'>Social harm</span></u><span style='font-size:
     12.0pt'> – The social harm in this case is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
     normal'>death</i> of the victim, but it is in dispute what constitutes
     death in this case. The Model Penal
     Code is silent on the definition of “death”.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The defendant, citing common law
     precedent, claims that the social harm envisioned by the Model Penal Code
     is the cessation of circulatory and respiratory activity.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The People, on the other hand, argue
     that “brain death” is, or should be, the social harm.</span></li>

     style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mens
     rea</span></u></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> – In order to be
     convicted of criminal homicide under the Model Penal Code § 210.1(1), the defendant
     must have caused the victim’s death <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purposely,
     knowingly, recklessly, </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>negligently</i>.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no evidence in the record on
     this appeal of the state of mind of the defendant at the time of the
     killing. However, because the defendant
     does not raise this issue on appeal and the record describes the defendant
     as having “shot his victim in the head”, it can be inferred that the <i
     style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mens rea</i> of purpose was proven at trial
     such that it is not at issue now. The
     Model Penal Code § 210.2(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>a) would classify the
     defendant’s offense as murder, which is a felony of the first degree (§
     210.2(2)).</span></li>
 <li style='mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><u><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt'>Actual causation</span></u><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt'> – Under the Model Penal Code § 2.03(1<span
     class=GramE>)(</span>a), the defendant’s conduct is the cause of the
     resulting offense when “it is an antecedent but for which the result in
     question would not have occurred”. To
     determine whether the defendant is an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual
     cause</i> of the social harm in this case, we ask, more specifically: “But
     for the voluntary act of the defendant, would the social harm have
     occurred <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>when it did</i>?”<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the defendant had not shot the victim,
     the victim would not have become <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>brain
     dead</i> when he did, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>,
     alternatively, would not have ceased respiration and circulation when he
     did. Therefore, the defendant is an
     actual cause of the death of the victim.<br>
     <br>
     There are no additional causal requirements in the Code as contemplated in
     § 2.03(1<span class=GramE>)(</span>b).</span></li>
 <li style='mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><u><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt'>Proximate causation </span></u><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt'>– The Model Penal Code disposes of the proximate
     causation issue in short order. Because
     purposely causing a certain result (the death of the victim) was an
     element of the defendant’s offense, and because the actual result
     involves, arguably, the same kind of injury or harm as that contemplated
     by the defendant, we consult § 2.03(2<span class=GramE>)(</span>b).<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This section tells us that because the
     actual result (death under the traditional definition) is not too remote
     or accidental from the contemplated result that the defendant alleges
     (brain death) to have an effect on the defendant’s liability.</span></li>

returned home one day and, to his shock, observed his wife in bed with
Victor. Enraged, Bob stalked out of the
house, walked next door, and angrily asked Ann, his neighbor, for a gun that he
knew that she lawfully kept for self-protection. When she asked him why he needed it, he
angrily stated, “I need a gun to kill someone.” Ann gave him her gun, saying, “Go get him.”</span></p>

instantly. Because of his rage, Bob had
not seen the knife in Victor’s hand when he shot him.</span></p>

     Code, in order to be guilty of criminal homicide, a person must commit the
     <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actus reus</i> of killing another human
     being purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, § 210.1.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is evidence that Bob acted with
     purpose in killing Victor. Bob told
     Ann that he was planning to kill someone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
     </span>[Bob also had the motive to kill Victor: he was angry at him for
     sleeping with his wife.] This would
     make Bob guilty of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>murder</i>, §
     210.2(1)(a), unless a jury can be persuaded that Bob was acting under the
     influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable
     explanation or excuse, § 210.3(1)(b), in which case Bob’s crime would be <i
     style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>manslaughter</i>.<br>
     <br>
     Bob could argue that witnessing his wife in an apparent act of adultery
     enraged him so much that he experienced extreme emotional distress that
     continued through the time of the actual killing.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This would be a threshold question of
     law for the judge. If the judge
     allowed this argument to go before a jury, Bob would further need to
     persuade the jury that the disturbance was reasonable.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In doing this, Bob needs to try to get
     the jury to sympathize with his position and imagine being in his shoes.<br>
     <br>
     The State would argue, however, that Bob had adequate time in the course
     of going to his neighbor’s house and back that he either no longer was under
     the influence of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extreme </i>distress
     or that such distress was no longer <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable
     </i>at the time of the killing. It
     could be argued that, in essence, no one could stay <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
     normal'>that mad </i>for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that long </i>(a
     question for the judge), or that, alternatively, no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
     normal'>reasonable person</i> could stay that mad for that long (a
     question for the jury).<br>
     <br>
     If the fact is conceded that Bob was so enraged that he did not see the
     knife in Victor’s hand, Bob could argue that this is evidence that his
     extreme emotional disturbance continued to the moment of the killing.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bob could claim that no one could fail
     to perceive the danger of another person holding a knife unless they were experiencing
     extreme distress of the nature contemplated by the Model Penal Code.<br>
     <br>
     [The purpose of allowing the partial defense of extreme emotional or
     mental disturbance is to recognize that society sees an actor as less at
     fault if they are not in full control of their actions due to a
     disturbance with an understandable or reasonable cause.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, a retributivist would
     find that Bob did not act fully by choice, and thus his culpability is
     limited by his ability to freely choose not to commit the offense.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From a utilitarian perspective, on the
     other hand, someone in a rage like Bob may not be deterred from committing
     murder, and therefore it serves no purpose to punish him for murder
     because, arguably, no net social gain will result.]</span></li>
 <li style='mso-list:l7 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'><u><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt'>Actual causation</span></u><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt'> – Under the Model Penal Code, Bob’s conduct was

     – Bob’s killing of Victor was justified for self-protection if Bob
     believed that such force was immediately necessary to protect himself
     against the use of unlawful force by Victor, § 3.04(1).<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because Bob used deadly force, Bob is
     not justified unless he believed that deadly force was necessary to
     protect himself from being killed or seriously injured by Victor, § 3.04(2<span
     class=GramE>)(</span>b). Bob’s case
     for justification by self-protection is weak for several reasons: first,
     he did not see the knife in Victor’s hand, which makes the use of deadly
     force unjustifiable given the circumstances as Bob believed them to
     be. Furthermore, because Victor was
     10 feet away, Bob will have a hard time proving that he <i

      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, 1994.</span>
      </p>

      <p><span>276 N.J. Super. 142, 647 A.2d 841.</span></p>

      <p><span>Prosser, pp. 314-319</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The spare tire fell off of Yun�s van and rolled to the left side of
          the highway. Chang got out of Yun�s car and ran across the highway to
          get the spare tire. While running back, he got hit by a car and died.
          Yun sued a whole bunch of people. All of them got summary judgment
          except for the driver and owner of the car that hit Chang.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>Yun appealed the
          judgment.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the defendants� negligence constitute the proximate cause of the
          harm to Chang?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          The defendant shall not be found liable when a superseding cause other
          than the defendant�s negligence is responsible for the harm.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court basically says that Chang was really stupid and shouldn�t
          have gone running across the street. The court says that this
          unforeseeable conduct basically breaks the chain of proximate
          causation that might otherwise hold at least some of the defendants
          liable.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The dissent says that the case is not such a slam dunk that it should
          be taken away from a jury. The minority says it is debatable whether
          the defective spare tire assembly caused the plaintiff�s death. The
          judge makes the point that judges in general are more conservative
          than the public at large, and what seems unreasonable and imprudent to
          a judge might seem like reasonable behavior to the average
          person.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The dismissal of the suit was upheld, but the New Jersey Supreme Court
          later overturned the ruling of this court and reinstated the
          suit.</span

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The plaintiff was giving birth and a doctor came to help out. He
          brought another man who was not a doctor with him. The plaintiff
          believed he was a doctor. He touched her, and she sued for battery.
          She won, and the defendants appealed.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Is the plaintiff�s consent valid if she was misled about one of the
          defendants being a doctor?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          The plaintiff had a legal right to privacy. Her consent is not valid
          if obtained by deceit.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court says the non-doctor�s presence was not necessary, so there
          was no excuse for him being there. If she didn�t know he wasn�t a
          doctor, she can�t give consent.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The court upheld the verdicts.</span>

            >This sure seems like a battery. It doesn�t seem like anyone would
            consent to eating poison. One would reasonably assume under the
            circumstances of the second case that the person representing
            himself as a doctor is a doctor of medicine. Again, consent is
            obtained through deceit and it�s no good.</span

            if B knew he was infected. In the second case, consent is definitely
            obtained fraudulently. In the case of the cheating husband, I think
            it might make a difference if the wife directly asked the husband if
            he was having an affair, or if he explicitly represented that he
            wasn�t having sex with anyone else.</span

v. Boadle</span></i></p>

<p><span>Court
of Exchequer, 1863.</span></p>

<p><span>2
H. &amp; C. 722, 159 Eng.Rep. 299.</span></p>

<p><span>Prosser,
pp. 229-231</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Byrne was walking past
Boadle's shop and suddenly a barrel of flour hit him in the head. Byrne sued for negligence. He gets nonsuited (dismissed) for failing to
make a prima facie case for negligence, but the court says that if the Court of
Exchequer will buy the plaintiff's case, the plaintiff can get £50.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Can the defendant be found
negligent without any other evidence?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> NEW RULE!!! <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>RES IPSA LOQUITUR! The thing speaks for itself.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> Pollock basically says:
"Well, what the hell else could have happened? Barrels of flour don't just fall out of the sky! Somebody did something stupid, and someone
got hurt! What more do you need???"</span></p>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> I think the plaintiff got
his quid.</span></p>

dir=LTR><span>The only thing
that the plaintiff has offered as evidence is the sheer fact that a barrel of
flour fell out of the window. The rule
is that the plaintiff doesn't need to eliminate all other possibilities, but
rather the plaintiff only needs to show that it was more likely than not that
the defendant was the one responsible. If the defendant was a deliverer of flour, it might be easier to argue
that "it wasn't me, it was him!"</span></span></p>

said that "<i>Res ipsa loquitur, sed quid in infernos dicet?</i>" is a phrase
Prosser made up that means "The thing speaks for itself, but what the hell is
it saying???" I think what Pollock means
is that this was such a crazy, weird thing to happen that the sheer fact that
it happened, without more, shows that <i>somebody</i> was negligent.</span></span></p>

negligent). In some jurisdictions,
contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff is considered (this is
true in the Restatement).</span></span></p>

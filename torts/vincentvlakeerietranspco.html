<p><i><span>Vincent
v. Lake Eric Transp. Co.</span></i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<p><span>Supreme
Court of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, 1910.</span></p>

<p><span>109
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Minn.</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> 456, 124 N.W. 221.</span></p>

<p><span>Prosser,
pp. 120-121</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> A steamship was moored to a
dock when a storm came in. If the ship
had been cut loose from the dock, it would have been blown away and might have
caused damage to something else. Instead, the ship was tied to the dock, but because of the storm, it
kept hitting the dock, damaging it. The
owner of the dock sued the owner of the steamship. The trial court found for the plaintiffs and
the defendant appealed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Does the defendant have the
privilege by necessity to moor the ship such that the defendant is not liable?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> The defendant has a <i>partial
</i>privilege to protect its private property from serious harm. The defendant will be subject to liability to
anyone who is injured.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court basically says to
the defendant that what it did was right under the circumstances, but that
doesn’t mean it doesn’t have to pay the plaintiff for the damage done. The court implicitly distinguishes this case
from <i><a href="suroccovgeary.html">Surocco</a></i> in that the former case
dealt with <i>public</i> necessity.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The court affirmed the
order denying a new trial.</span></p>

good economic argument for this rule. We
want to encourage an actor like </span></span><st1:place><span
>Lake Erie</span></st1:place><span> in this case to make an
efficient decision about whether to moor its ship or not. Society’s goal should be to minimize the <i>total</i>
loss to <i>society</i>. $500 in damage
to the dock is probably nothing compared to the cost of the destruction of the
steamship. However, we do want to
equitably distribute this loss. Vincent
really had no interest in the steamship, so Vincent shouldn’t have to pay to
maintain it or preserve it from damage. It is appropriate in this case to shift the cost to </span><st1:place><span
>Lake Erie</span></st1:place><span> not only for the present
case, but for subsequent cases. We want
to encourage actors like Vincent to allow the economically efficient use of
their facilities by assuring them that they will be compensated for any damage.</span></p>

different because the safety of persons would be at stake and the law values
the protection of human life more highly than property. I think the ship’s owner would not be liable
for any damages that occurred during the period the crewmen were escaping. However, once all the crewmen are safe, I
think the ship’s owner could be liable for any damages that followed.</span></span></p>

dir=LTR><span>It is not
clear from the description here, but it is clear from the record of the case,
that the plaintiff and the extortioner were not one and the same. It does not seem at all just that you should
substitute your safety for that of an innocent bystander. The case is rather lengthy, but the defendant
seems to get off scot-free because the court finds that the extortioner was the
proximate cause of the harm to the plaintiff rather than the act of the defendant. But didn’t the defendant have a duty to the plaintiff
to warn him that a bomb was about to go off and that he should take cover? I guess the court says that when you’re under
duress, to act out of self-preservation and anything you do is either
involuntary or can be otherwise excused. I wonder if the court ruled the way it did because it was bribed by the
wealthy defendant.</span></span></p>

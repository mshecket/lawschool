        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Two men fought in a prize fight. One was killed in the course of the
          fight. His estate sued the other fighter. The action was dismissed and
          the plaintiff appealed.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Can an action for wrongful death be brought when both parties
          consented to the fight even though it was unlawful?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court considers and rejects two rules for liability arising from
          injuries in a fight. The �majority rule� says that both parties should
          be liable to each other even though they consented to the fight. The
          �minority rule� says that the combat is unlawful and thus neither
          party can recover damages except in the case of �excessive force or
          malicious intent�. The court <span class="GramE">decides</span> that
          neither rule holds because the fight was not entered into in anger nor
          was there malicious intent to cause serious injury. The court settles
          on its own rule, and reasons that you don�t need to reward the guy
          that got hurt more in the fight to enforce the criminal statute
          against prize fighting.</span

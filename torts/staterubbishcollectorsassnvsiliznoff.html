<p><i><span>State
Rubbish Collectors Ass’n v. Siliznoff</span></i><span></span></p>

<p><span>Supreme
Court of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, 1952.</span></p>

<p><span>38
Cal.2d 330, 240 P.2d 282.</span></p>

<p><span>Prosser,
p. 47-50</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:
</span></b><span>Siliznoff
was intimidated into signing notes by the threat of future physical force. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The plaintiffs sued Siliznoff for collection
of the debts, but Siliznoff said that he was not liable for them because he
signed under duress. Furthermore,
Siliznoff filed a counterclaim saying that he had been assaulted after a
fashion. The defendant prevailed on the
claim and counterclaim, and the plaintiffs appealed on the basis that there was
no evidence of assault. They argued that
assault involves only threats of immediate force rather than threats of future
force.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:
</span></b><span>Can someone
be liable for an intentional tort if they violate only the mental and emotional
well-being of another person?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:
</span></b><span>The old
rules state that the law will not protect individuals from invasions of their
emotional and mental well-being. However, the court cites a change in the law reflected in the
Restatement of Torts that says there may be an action for infliction of severe
emotional distress.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:
</span></b><span>The court
recognizes a change in the direction of the law. It makes analogies to other well-recognized
torts, saying that in the case of assault, battery, false imprisonment and
defamation, mental distress will be the primary component of the injury. The court also counters arguments that
allowing mental distress claims will lead to a flood of litigation. The court says that it is up to juries to
decide if the mental distress was serious enough to be actionable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The court upheld the verdicts
for the defendant.</span></p>

not lie because there was no threat of immediate harm. False imprisonment does not lie because the plaintiffs

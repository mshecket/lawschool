        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Almy was an insane person under the care of McGuire. The plaintiff
          entered a room where the defendant was having a fit and tried to grab
          a leg of a chair from her. The defendant hit her with the leg. The
          plaintiff sued for battery.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> Is an insane person liable for their torts?</span>

        <b><span>Rule: </span></b
        ><span>Though there wasn�t an established rule in </span

          ><st1:place><span>Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >, other courts had found that broadly speaking, insane people are
          liable. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>The court establishes
          the rule that an insane person is as liable as a normal person when he
          does intentional damage to people or property.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis: </span></b
        ><span
          >The court reasons that if children can be liable for torts, insane
          people ought to be liable as well. As a policy matter, the court says
          that if insane persons are liable for torts, it will make those caring
          for them more careful to keep them from hurting others.</span

            and instead hit Aunt Nellie. The doctrine of transferred intent will
            say that they�re liable for hitting Aunt Nellie even though they
            didn�t form the intent to hit her in particular. Intent seems to be
            different from fault, and fault isn�t necessary for an intentional
            tort, but fault is harder to argue for.</span

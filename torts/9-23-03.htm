          <i>foreseeable </i>harm. The first question, therefore, is:
          <i>ex ante</i>, was there foreseeable harm? Even if there was
          foreseeable harm, there still may be a finding of no negligence. If we
          feel that it�s not feasible to take the precaution and thus protect
          against the harm, we may let you off the hook. This is both a cost
          question and a technology question.</span

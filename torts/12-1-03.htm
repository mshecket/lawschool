        <span
          >If we had more classes, the next topic we�d do would be products
          liability. If you�re interested in strict liability, you can take
          Advanced Torts. Basically, the strict liability regime operates in a
          limited way in Torts, but there are certain categories in which strict
          liability has been viewed as appropriate. Strict liability doesn�t
          achieve greater compliance or more reasonable behavior from
          defendants. You�ll always get the same behavior from the defendants,
          but it forces the defendants to weigh whether they should engage in
          that activity in that place at all. You force them to try to figure
          out whether they should do that activity in that place at all.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >With strict liability for animals, the whole notion of treating
          domestic animals differently than wild animals forces the owner to
          consider whether it is reasonable or smart to keep wild animals at
          all.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Is this just negligence in disguise? We have an activity with low
          value relative to the risk it creates and the harm caused if that risk
          came to fruition. Keeping a dangerous domestic animal is not a
          valuable activity to society, while it is has a high risk of a great
          harm. That�s why we�ll just shorthand it in some sense and make it an
          activity for which we impose strict liability.</span

        <span
          >This is the origin of the �ultrahazardous activities� rule. A guy
          built a water reservoir that ended up flooding his neighbor�s coal
          mine. Prior to building the reservoir, what did he do? Did he do
          anything in preparation? They�re building a reservoir and fail to
          notify the defendant that there�s a problem. They continue to dig the
          reservoir. Water leaked slowly into the mine and eventually flooded
          the mine. Why does it matter that water seeped into the mine rather
          than rushing into the mine? Was this direct harm?</span

          doesn�t like this rationale. It doesn�t seem fair to go after an
          entity which didn�t do anything wrong in itself. Also, the employer is
          benefiting from the activities of the employee. Therefore, it is
          argued, the employer should bear some responsibility for the
          employee�s actions. The employer can buy insurance and spread the cost
          by raising prices. The employer also has control of the employee.
          These are some rationales for imposing vicarious liability on the

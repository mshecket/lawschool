        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Knell was driving a car and got into an accident with a taxi owned by
          Feltman. Knell�s passengers sued Feltman for negligence, and Feltman
          in turn sued Knell, saying that his negligence caused the accident.
          The jury awarded damages to Knell�s passengers, and then awarded
          Feltman half of those damages from Knell. Knell appealed on the basis
          that his passengers never tried to get a judgment against him.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Shall Feltman be denied contribution from Knell because Knell wasn�t a
          target of the plaintiffs� litigation?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          NEW RULE (at least for D.C.)! There doesn�t need to be a joint
          judgment against two people who are negligent in order to enforce
          contribution. (There is no contribution between
          <i>intentional</i> tortfeasors, though.)</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court says that the right to get contribution lies with the person
          who has been forced to pay. In this case, that�s Feltman. The
          plaintiff has no right to decide who should pay for a wrong.
          Otherwise, the plaintiff might sue one person and not another just
          because they like them less as opposed to because they factually were
          more responsible for the harm done.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There used to be a rule that there was no contribution between joint
          or concurrent tortfeasors, but this court finds that rule to be wrong
          all along.</span

        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</span>

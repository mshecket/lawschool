<br/>

<p><span>Which
is older: VMI or the Equal Protection Clause? VMI actually predated the Equal Protection Clause. The Equal Protection Clause came after the
Civil War. VMI came before the Civil
War. So the folks in Congress wrote the Fourteenth
Amendment and sent it to the states for ratification. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> originally refused to ratify
the Fourteenth Amendment, but they were coerced into doing so by making it a
precondition for getting back into the </span><st1:place><span
>Union</span></st1:place><span>. So let’s say it’s 1875 or so and the same
lawsuit is broad as in this case, challenging the legitimacy of VMI as a
male-only institution. At that time,
what would have happened? It would have
most certainly been dismissed!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court has adopted intermediate scrutiny for gender discrimination in part
because race discrimination, for which there is strict scrutiny, was more on
the mind of the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment. But if the drafters of the Fourteenth
Amendment didn’t even think they were addressing gender discrimination, why
should gender discrimination get elevated scrutiny at all? There have certainly been social changes
between then and now.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
could the level of scrutiny change under the Fourteenth Amendment? The Fourteenth Amendment hasn’t been <span
class=SpellE>reratified</span> or readopted since 1868. Can this be understood in terms of legality? There is a proposal to amendment the Constitution
with the Equal Rights Amendment. We felt
that the Constitution didn’t provide for gender equality. Many felt that the Nineteenth Amendment didn’t
go far enough. But the ERA didn’t get
ratified, and even had opposition from women. So how can the Court justify its result in finding that the Equal
Protection Clause is different in 1976 than in 1868? The Constitution isn’t necessarily perfect,
and there may be a lot that we don’t personally like about it. But legality says that we abide by it anyway. Just who should be allowed to say what the Constitution
is?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Maybe
we could say that the Court can say what the Equal Protection Clause means
until the people choose to amend it. What did the Equal Protection Clause mean originally? Some historical evidence suggests that it was
limited to certain basic rights like the right to make contracts or be a
witness in a trial or to own property.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Arguably,
the people who wrote the Fourteenth Amendment thought that discrimination on
any basis with regard to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>those particular
civil rights</i> would violate the amendment. But did they understand the Fourteenth Amendment to affect the existence
of VMI, or the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>University</span></st1:PlaceType><span
> of </span><st1:PlaceName><span
 >Virginia</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span> (which was all-male at the
time)? If the Equal Protection Clause
meant one thing when it was adopted and means something different now, then
when did its meaning change, and by what legal process did its meaning change?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Does
Congress have the power to say that there may not be any single-sex colleges in
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>? If so, why should the Court be able to usurp
that power? Isn’t Congress much more
able to respond to social change? The
Court is just supposed to enforce the law as it exists. Arguably, you can’t enforce rights that aren’t
there.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Should
there be a right to health care? Should
there be a right to education? Should there
be a right to literacy?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Bush Administration has proposed that the states should be allowed to engage in
single-sex education.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![endif]></span></p>

<p><span>Has
the meaning of the Constitution changed over time? How is that possible?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
is the significance of legislation being proposed in Congress but failing to be
adopted? Are there some proposals that
are so great that their failure is evidence of a flaw in the system? Or do we totally trust the system? If everyone in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> agreed to what the laws should
be, there would be no reason for debate at all. Maybe the country wasn’t ready for a national gender policy.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
there <span class=GramE>a disconnect</span> between Constitutional Law and
social policy? Here are two questions:
(1) <span class=GramE>How</span> do we figure out the meaning of the Fourteenth
Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause given that it was adopted in 1868 and
it hasn’t been changed or amended since? Can its meaning transform over time (c.f. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Brown v. Board of Education</i>)? (2) How can we understand these changes and know when they have
occurred? Is it wholly up to the Supreme
Court to decide when these changes will occur? Or is the Supreme Court not the agent of change but rather a reflection
of social change?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Even
if we accept the idea that the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment changes over
time, we’ll have to figure out just what it means. Say the VMI case is correctly decided. If we take it as a given, we need to figure
out whether single-sex classroom options in K-12 are allowed under the holding
of VMI. We take certain things as
given. For example, segregation on the
basis of race is presumptively unconstitutional. Perhaps segregation on the basis of gender
should be presumptively unconstitutional too.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
maybe there are acceptable forms of gender discrimination: we have separate men’s
and women’s sports. We tolerate separate
but equal in this area under Title IX. But we can’t have separate teams based on race.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
big fear at the time of the ERA was that it would supposedly eliminate
single-sex bathrooms. We actually did
formerly have single-race bathrooms in the South. So bathrooms were on people’s minds in the
1970s, according to Foley.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Then
how do we understand the relationship of social transformation to legal
transformation? We don’t know yet, but I
guess we will tomorrow.</span></p>

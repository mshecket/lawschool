          Sabri was charged under

            >18 U.S.C. � 666</a

          for bribing an agency that receives federal funds. Sabri moved to
          dismiss the indictment, claiming that � 666 was facially
          unconstitutional because it lacked a �jurisdictional hook� between the
          federal funds and the conduct. The district court accepted the
          argument and dismissed the indictment. The federal government appealed
          to the Eighth Circuit.</span

          be sustained on that basis. The court notes that � 666

          <span class="GramE">is</span> constitutional under a combination of
          the Necessary and Proper Clause and the Spending Clause. The statute
          doesn�t seem to hold up under the Spending Clause alone, so the court
          looks elsewhere in the Constitution. The court cites authority for the
          proposition that the Necessary and Proper Clause, among other things,
          allows Congress to pass laws that help it disburse federal funds. The
          court sees the Necessary and Proper Clause as an affirmation that
          Congress can use a wide range of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">means</i> to achieve
          constitutionally enumerated

          is an appropriate means to achieve a constitutional end under the
          Spending Clause. There are two questions to be answered: (1) Can
          Congress enact criminal legislation under the Necessary and Proper
          Clause? (2) Is the enactment of � 666 rationally related to the
          desired end?</span

          the federal government has the power to pass federal criminal laws to
          help enforce its constitutional powers. The majority further claims
          that � 666 is rationally related to its goal of protecting the
          integrity of federal funds and not so broad as to regulate purely
          state or local criminal conduct.

          conduct has no connection to federal interests, and thus the law
          oversteps the bounds of federal constitutional authority. Bye says
          that �necessary� and �proper� are separate requirements. Bye finds
          that some of the authority that would be given to Congress if � 666
          was upheld is not �proper�. Bye makes a big deal out of the fact that
          at oral argument the government disavowed the Necessary and Proper
          Clause as a basis for upholding � 666.</span

          according to the government is stare decisis. They say that the
          Supreme Court has already considered the basis of the defendant�s
          motion to dismiss and has already rejected it. The district court�s
          order is purported to conflict with the holding of

          >In that case, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that � 666 was
          not allowed under the Spending Clause without the requirement that
          government show an effect on federal funds. The government claims that
          the only way to distinguish the petitioner�s argument in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Salinas </i>and the defendant�s
          argument here is that while the petitioner in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Salinas</i> was asking for the
          statute to be declared unconstitutional as applied to him in
          particular, Sabri wants the district court to declare the statute
          unconstitutional as applied to everyone, including, the government
          points out, Salinas. But, the government says, the Supreme Court has
          already found that the statute

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span> Out-of-state milk producers challenged an amendment to a </span

          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          milk regulation program involving pricing and pooling. The petitioners
          claimed that </span

          was not authorized by Congress to restrict interstate commerce in the
          way they had. However, </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          urged that
          <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/7/7254.html"
            >7 U.S.C. �7254</a
          >
          authorized such restrictions. The petitioners also claimed that the
          amendment unlawfully discriminated against them simply for being from
          out-of-state, which is unconstitutional under the Privileges and
          Immunities Clause. </span

          officials argue that they were merely eliminating a loophole that
          created an unfair advantage for out-of-state producers. The district
          court dismissed the suit and the Ninth Circuit upheld the dismissal.
          The producers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> (1) Are the </span

          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          regulations an unconstitutional restriction on interstate commerce in
          violation of the Negative Commerce Clause? (2) Do the regulations

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          States can only pass laws that burden interstate commerce if they are
          authorized to do so by Congress. A regulation
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">may</i> violate the Privileges
          and Immunities Clause even if it doesn�t explicitly mention
          out-of-state citizens on its face.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The exemption carved out by Congress is found to only relate to
          composition and labeling but not pricing and pooling. Therefore,
          Congress has not acted to permit </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">California</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span> to pass those particular laws.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Thus </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >�s milk regulations are neither exempt from Commerce Clause scrutiny,
          nor are they exempt from a Privileges and Immunities Clause challenge
          just because the state statute doesn�t mention out-of-state residents
          explicitly.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is vacated and the case is
          remanded.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Padilla</i>? Is this case
          distinguishable? Padilla isn�t a member of al Qaeda. But Haupt, the
          American citizen in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Quirin</i>,
          was a uniformed, paid solider of the German army. That�s a factual
          distinction between Padilla and Haupt. Also, there is a question of
          whether or not there is congressional authorization for the detention
          of Padilla. The Court in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Quirin</i> says that there
          definitely <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">is</i> congressional
          authorization for subjecting Haupt to the military tribunal.</span

          hadn�t invented the three part analysis at the time this case was
          decided, but if we extrapolate backward to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Quirin</i>, the court says that
          Congress, through its Acts including promulgating the articles of war
          for the </span

          military, has authorized detentions and trials in these circumstances.
          But does the Constitution as a whole bar Congress and the president
          from trying an American citizen by a military entity as opposed to
          being tried by a civilian court?<br

          citizen. What�s the Court�s rationale for allowing him to be subjected
          to military jurisdiction?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Haupt was found to be an unlawful combatant under the Geneva
          Convention or Hague Convention. What if Haupt had been a lawful
          combatant of the German army? Would he be entitled to a criminal trial
          in a U.S. District Court? No, he would have prisoner of war status and
          would be subject to military jurisdiction, but of a different type
          than the jurisdiction he was submitted to in this case. POWs were
          simply treated differently. The procedures for POWs would be more in
          the nature of courts-martial. You get more rules of evidence and
          better access to counsel, among other things, in a court
          martial.</span

      <p>
        <span

          army, but had instead been a native-born American Nazi sympathizer
          without orders from the German government, and he had decided to blow
          up buildings in the United States, then under the reasoning of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Quirin</i>, could he have been
          subjected to the same military tribunal that he was in the present
          case? Does <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Quirin</i> establish
          the authority of Congress and the president to subject American Nazis
          to military tribunals as opposed to civil prosecution for treason? How
          could we determine whether Haupt was an unlawful combatant?</span

          enemy belligerent if you associate yourself with the military arm of
          an enemy government and use its aid to enter the country to try to
          commit hostile acts. For example, Haupt used a German submarine to

          they argue that Hamdi did renounce his </span

        ><span>
          But Padilla�s connection to al Qaeda seems more tenuous than the

        <span
          >We left off talking about
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i>. Now we will talk
          about the relationship of contraception to abortion. To understand
          that discussion, Foley will give us a bit of history: the history
          concerning the status of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i>.
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> was the main
          precedent relied upon in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe v. Wade</i> when the right
          to abortion was recognized under the substantive due process doctrine.
          Some of the intermediate precedents had expanded the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> precedent from
          married to unmarried couples. When, in the 1980s, the Reagan
          Administration and the Department of Justice under Attorney General
          <span class="SpellE">Meese</span> asked the Supreme Court to overrule
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i>, there was a lot of
          discussion about what is right or wrong in Constitutional Law. The
          question came up when President Reagan nominated Robert Bork for the
          U.S. Supreme Court when Justice Powell retired in 1986. Bork was known
          to be an opponent of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe v. Wade</i>. The Senate
          hearings discussed the extent of his opposition. Sen. Specter in
          particular asked Bork whether he disagreed with
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> also. Bork said
          that he did disagree, saying that the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">entire </i>doctrine of
          substantive due process was illegitimate, whether as articulated in
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lochner</i></span
          >
          or in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i>. Since
          neither contraception nor abortion is specified in the Constitution,
          Bork felt that there shouldn�t be any such rights. Bork was rejected
          by the Senate, and then Kennedy was nominated. He refused to take
          Bork�s position that substantive due process is wrong always and under
          all circumstances. With respect to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold v. Connecticut</i>, he
          clearly embraced the decision and accepted it as correct governing
          precedent.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Senate accepted Kennedy even though he didn�t say what he thought
          about <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i>. Kennedy�s vote
          is the crucial vote in reaffirming
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i> in the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Casey</i> decision. Kennedy
          changed his mind about overruling
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i> and joined a plurality
          opinion to sustain <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i>. So
          how do we understand the relationship of the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> decision to
          abortion? Kennedy changed his mind about this: can the Constitution
          protect the right to contraception as
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> holds, yet not
          protect a right to abortion as
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i> holds?
          <span class="SpellE">Meese</span> and others argued that the Court was
          not right to protect a right to abortion even though it was right to
          protect the right to contraception.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So what�s the difference between contraception and abortion?
          Contraception is preventative, while abortion terminates an existing
          pregnancy. However, it does prevent a birth.
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> prevented any form
          of birth control, including IUDs. IUDs are considered a contraceptive
          in common parlance, but they work by preventing implantation, rather
          than preventing fertilization. In some sense, that could be considered
          abortion rather than contraception depending on how you define things.
          Also, the �morning after pill� works up to 72 hours after
          fertilization. So some forms of birth control prevent fertilization
          and some do not. We will find that viability becomes an important
          turning point.</span

      <p>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span>Griswold</span></i
        ><span>
          did not decide the question of what should happen when a woman is 12
          weeks into a pregnancy. The
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i> and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Casey</i> decisions cover a
          woman who is 12 weeks pregnant, but
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> did not purport to
          cover such a factual pattern. As far as the morning-after pill and IUD
          go, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> explicitly
          covers at least the IUD, even though it is post-fertilization. But is
          RU-486 within <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> or
          beyond <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i>? Is it a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i>-covered case or a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i>-covered case? Does it
          make a difference when you take RU-486? Where do we draw the line?
          Should this be a purely legislative decision? Is the Court simply
          making value judgments?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We must address this as a constitutional issue as lawyers. If we
          suppose that the Court
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">had</i> overruled
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i> in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Casey</i>, or if it does so in
          the future, and thus abortion is no longer protected, then what is the
          legally correct scope of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i>? Most people
          today, partly because of the history of Bork losing his nomination,
          say that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> has to
          remain accepted as Constitutional Law. Purists like Scalia can no
          longer make it to the Court, and every nominee coming before the
          Senate must accept
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> as good law.
          <span class="SpellE">Souter</span> ducked the question. But the
          political compromise in the Senate is the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> must stand. If
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i> were overturned, we
          would still have to figure out what
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> would still mean.
          One argument made in favor of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i> as precedent is that
          these cases stand for a �zone of personal privacy� with respect to
          reproductive choices. As long as these decisions stand, it is argued,
          the </span

        ><span> where you may only have a certain number of children.</span>
      </p>

          because our legislatures would not adopt forced sterilization laws.
          However, they would argue that we don�t have protection in the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Constitution</i> against forced
          sterilization because that�s not in the Constitution. They would say
          that we could <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">amend</i> the
          Constitution if we wanted to. But the Constitution doesn�t dictate a
          specific answer!</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> meant to
          protect the use of IUDs, then it must protect contraception/abortion
          for up to 72 hours after fertilization, according to Foley. The
          language of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> focuses on privacy
          in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">home</i>, and in the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">bedroom</i> in particular. What
          is the impact of this precedent on the regulation of RU-486? One of
          the virtues of RU-486 is that it can be available in an emergency when
          the need for contraception was not anticipated.</span

          ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </i>was overruled, there is
          the chance for this branch of substantive due process to get overruled
          too. But if <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roe</i> gets
          overruled, does the whole modern substantive due process apparatus
          fall as well? Or will
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> stand? Does the
          Constitution protect sexual freedom on the one hand, or reproductive
          freedom on the other? In the old days, sex and reproduction went
          together. But with modern technology, we can have sex without
          reproduction and reproduction without sex. Constitutional Law has to
          try to think through how to deal with these issues.</span

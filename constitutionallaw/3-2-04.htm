<p><span>We
are moving from the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>structural </i>half
of the course to a focus on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>individual
rights</i>, especially those protected by the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Fourteenth Amendment</i>. We’ll
return to power questions at the end of the semester. We’ll also read the briefs for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a href="padillavrumsfeld.htm">Padilla</a></i>
when they come out.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Few
people volunteer when they don’t have to. Foley says that we should all chip in! Take the opportunity to benefit from Foley’s feedback!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Note
that class participation is part of your grades. It’s not just what you say when you get
called on, but also what you volunteer. But
don’t say dumb stuff! Make good points
and you’ll get points! That’s the
carrot.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
stick is that at some point we’ll have gone finished going on call. Foley is considering whether to have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>everyone</i> on call at that point. If Foley thinks that people aren’t
volunteering enough, he may push for the traditional method.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>In re Cheney</span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case, in many ways, is a perfect juxtaposition to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Nixon</i>. We’ll explore
differences between the two cases.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a difficult case because of the terminology involved and the complex rules
of suing the government. It’s hard to
sue the government! That might be good
or it might be bad, but being a plaintiff in a lawsuit when the defendant is a government
agency or government official raises many procedural questions. The course to take in order to best
understand this is Administrative Law. If there’s any one course that you take as an upper level student, Foley
encourages us to take this one course. He says that it’s the hardest area of law to teach <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>yourself</i> in practice. It may
not be on the bar, but if you don’t learn it in school, you’ll have a hard time
picking it up later. It’s a difficult
class because it’s not a traditional subject matter. You’re not so much learning a subject matter
as you’re learning a methodology or mode of analysis. This case gives us a flavor for just how
difficult it is.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
plaintiffs in this case are the Sierra Club and Judicial Watch. They are suing Vice President Cheney and
others. Why? They accuse Cheney and others of violating
FACA.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Isn’t
the concept of an advisory committee that you have people outside the government
giving the government advice? Wouldn’t
you want to bring in outside experts to clue you in on important topics? But if there are non-governmental personnel
involved with these meetings, the records of the meetings must be open to the
public. The Administration claims that
these meetings did not include any outsiders, and therefore the records should
not be made public. Cheney claims that
under the law they do not have to make the proceedings of the committee public.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
plaintiffs claim that there were outside officials who had a hand in the
drafting of the policy put out by the committee. But…so what? They issued a report, and you can read that report. Isn’t that the important thing? Shouldn’t the public only be concerned
whether the policy is good or bad? What’s
the counterargument?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Sierra Club wants to know who was at the meetings, what was said, and who is
really influencing the Administration’s policy. Does this energy policy favor “big oil”? Wasn’t “big oil” elected to the White House, Foley asks? What’s really going on? Why do the organizations want these
names? They want to know if Ken “Enron”
Lay was at the meeting. Why would we
want to know that? There are a couple of
reasons.</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>It would be politically embarrassing
to have an Enron person advising energy policy.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>More importantly, Enron was
Bush’s single largest campaign contributor in the 2000 campaign. That’s where the real allegation of
corruption comes in: Did Enron’s campaign contributions inappropriately buy the
company a seat at the table? Was there a
quid pro quo? Could this lawsuit <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>prove</i> a quid pro quo?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
lawsuits might expose what was said at the meeting and who was there. But it’s unlikely that any discussions during
the meetings would actually reference campaign contributions. All that these lawsuits could reveal would be
that campaign contributors were participating in the committee. But that’s all you can get! Is that a reason to not let the lawsuit go
forward?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Contrast
this with Nixon’s tapes. John Dean
claimed that he was in the Oval Office when there was a conspiracy to cover up
Watergate. The tapes could prove <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>whether there was a crime or not</i>. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The connections were very close!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Sierra Club and Judicial Watch don’t allege any particular crime. Even if the predicate allegation is that Lay
was at the meeting and that he was a campaign contributor, they can’t show that
airing these records would prove a crime of any kinds.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Presidents
are entitled to meet with CEOs of corporations. FACA covers advisory committees. Is FACA constitutional? Every
time the president decides to ask American citizens for advice, he has to jump
through certain hoops. Is that something
that Congress can force the president to do? Is this, in itself, a Separation of Powers issue?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Do
we have an equivalent parallel in this case to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Nixon</i>? Will this case feel
like Watergate to the Supreme Court? Is
this an evil president who we have to stop from subverting the system of government? According to Foley, this case isn’t going to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>feel</i> like Watergate. Foley believes that this will be
dispositive. The Court will find
doctrine that will support this conclusion. Foley thinks the Court will find it inappropriate to subject the Vice
President and cabinet-level officials to be subject to document requests like
the one at issue in this case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Even
if there is a real risk that Ken Lay improperly influenced the Bush
Administration, the FACA law wasn’t designed to prevent such influence. If you want to prove that something was done
improperly as far as campaign contributions, you’ll have to narrow your
target. To win a case under the terms of
FACA, you don’t have to prove anything about campaign contributions, because it
doesn’t matter who was meeting with the president and it doesn’t matter whether
they gave money or not.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
large has the potential to be hugely broad. Sierra Club and Judicial Watch have proffered no evidence that Ken Lay
was at the meeting. They just <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>think</i> he was there. Yet, on the face of the statute, high level government
officials could be exposed to a very expensive and time-consuming process. Foley thinks that the Court will not let Congress
do that with this law and will send them back to the drawing board.</span></p>

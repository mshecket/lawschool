<p><span>Yesterday
was great! Foley likes when people come
up after class to ask questions! There’s
a lot going on here, and we can’t get it all in within an hour.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Foley
says constitutional law is much more of an art than a science. You need to get your hands dirty and practice
this stuff in order to really get it!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Note
that all nine justices agree in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="unitedstatesvlopez.htm">Lopez</a></i> that the Constitution is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>incredibly imprecise</i>. “That’s just the nature of the beast.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>A bit of a history lesson</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>We
read a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ton</i> of history in
Chemerinsky. History isn’t important in
and of itself. This isn’t a history
class where we enjoy history for its own sake; instead, we study history as a
means to an end. The goal is to
understand current law and what future law might look like. The only reason we care about the past is to
help us understand the present and the future. Don’t worry about understanding the details of each stage of Commerce
Clause jurisprudence from the beginning of time to the present.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
we need to know, first off, is that there was a formative period under Chief
Justice Marshall, who issued the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McCulloch
v. Maryland </i>decision. That’s a
landmark decision that created a framework for talking about congressional
power as a whole. Also, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Marshall</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s reasoning interpreted the
Constitution <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in general</i>, rather than
any particular <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>phrase</i> or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>section</i>. He didn’t look at the word “necessary” or the word “proper” and
determine what those words mean. Instead, he looked at the Constitution <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>in general</i>. Why do we have a
Constitution? What function does the Constitution
have? These questions gave him the
guidelines for his understanding of, in particular, the Necessary and Proper
Clause.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>He
had a choice: he could have interpreted the Necessary and Proper Clause much
more narrowly and restrictively and found that the creation of the Bank of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> was outside of Congress’s
power. He didn’t choose the narrow path,
he chose the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>broad</i> path. This case is important today because we must
be aware that the concept of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general
reasoning</i> is available to the Court, if it so chooses, as a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>methodology</i> to think about constitutional
problems when they arise for the first time.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court doesn’t always take this approach, though. The Court will sometimes take a more “word-specific”
approach.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Marshall</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> also issued the first
opinion that interpreted the Commerce Clause: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Gibbons v. Ogden</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Today,
we’ll talk about four key decisions that set the stage prior to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a href="unitedstatesvlopez.htm">Lopez</a></i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Schecter
Poultry</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case was decided in 1935. It’s the “sick
chicken” case. This case occurred at the
time of the New Deal. The country is in
the midst of the Depression. The
unemployment rate is 25%. Congress and
President Roosevelt are trying to deal with what they see as an unprecedented
economic calamity. Congress passes a lot
of New Deal legislation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>One
key piece of legislation was the National Industrial Recovery Act, which
regulated the wages and hours of workers in many different industries.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Supreme Court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unanimously</i> held that
regulating the wages and hours of workers in a factory in </span><st1:place><span
>Brooklyn</span></st1:place><span> is beyond Congress’s
commerce power. The new law was
invalidated. The Supreme Court ruled
that even though the chickens moved in the stream of commerce, the workers only
worked in </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Brooklyn</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> and thus their wages and hours were a matter solely for the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to deal with.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Note
that this law applied to every slaughterhouse everywhere.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
did the people in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Philadelphia</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> in 1787 scrap the Articles
of Confederation and give the U.S. Congress more power with this Commerce
Clause? Compare this to NAFTA or the
current </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Summit</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Americas</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. Prior to the adoption of the Commerce Clause,
the states of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> were engaged in
protectionist measures against each other. The Commerce Clause, at least in one view, was originally a free trade
measure among the states. It was meant
to fight “economic Balkanization”. In
contemporary terms, we can compare this to the European Union.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
framers of the Constitution wanted to create a free-trade agreement between the
original thirteen states. That’s all the
Commerce Clause was originally designed to do.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Now
fast forward to 1935. If you were to ask
James Madison, who came up with the Commerce Clause, about a shop in </span><st1:place><span
>Brooklyn</span></st1:place><span>, he would say “that’s not
what we meant!” He would say that they
were only concerned with free trade between </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and, say, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New Jersey</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
addition, the Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate foreign trade.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
point is that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nothing</i> that we talk
about today would make <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any sense</i> to
the framers of the Constitution. “Congress
has the power to regulate WHAT??!!” They
wouldn’t even be able to understand our conversation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
going to be difficult to think about is when we get to the point where we can
start having a conversation like we did yesterday.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>James
Madison did not believe that Congress had the power to create a national
bank. He had a much narrower
understanding of the Commerce Clause than we do. In fact, he had a narrower understanding than
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Marshall</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> did in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McCulloch</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Our
sense of the Constitution is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>radically
different</i> from the conception of the people who originally wrote the
document.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Carter Coal</span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case is one year later. We’re still in
the Depression. Congress and Roosevelt adopt
a new law that regulates the coal industry <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in
particular</i>. They believe that coal
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>particularly</i> important to the
national economy. It’s important for
running the railroads and making steel. Congress
says: “We won’t do poultry, but let’s do coal.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>They
plan to regulate the wages and hours of coal workers because that affects the
price of coal. But by a 5-4 decision,
the Supreme Court says that Congress can’t do that! They reason that a coal mine is not <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>interstate</i> in nature because each mine
is located in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only one state</i>. Therefore, the wages that a mine worker gets
for working in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that particular mine</i>
is a local issue of the state where the mine is located. Each state controls the conditions within the
mines within that state. The Court
believes that it matters neither that the coal will enter the stream of interstate
commerce, nor that Carter Coal does business in many different states. The subsequent entry of the coal into interstate
commerce doesn’t matter. But notice that
now we’re starting to get a split.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Jones &amp;
Laughlin</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case comes up in 1937. This case
involves the National Labor Relations Board. Congress comes up with a new law to govern working conditions: hours,
wages, and so on in many different industries. The statute looks a lot like the NIRA above, but the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>case</i> looks more like <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Carter Coal</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
issue is: Can Congress regulate the rules of the employees of this company when
they work in the mines or in particular factories? If you considered <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Schecter Poultry </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Carter
Coal</i> as precedent, you might think the conclusion is obvious and the law
can’t stand.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
in a reversal, the Supreme Court by a 5-4 margin allows the law to stand <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as applied</i>. The Supreme Court argued that steel is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>essential</i> to the health of the national
economy, and thus steel worker strikes would cripple interstate commerce. This is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exactly
the reverse </i>of the reasoning in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Carter
Coal</i>, that is, it’s the reasoning of the dissenter. The same argument from the dissent in the
previous case becomes the prevailing argument in this case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
does the transformation happen here? </span><st1:place><span
>Roosevelt</span></st1:place><span> was going to pack the
court. But note that there are no
changes in appointments to the court between 1935 and 1937. The exact same nine individuals who decided <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Schecter Poultry</i> unanimously and then
decided <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Carter Coal</i> decided <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Jones &amp; Laughlin</i> entirely
differently.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Roosevelt
and Congress are losing cases. He won’t
accept what the Supreme Court says. Also
note that 1936 is an election year. </span><st1:place><span
>Roosevelt</span></st1:place><span> runs a campaign essentially
against the “old farts” on the Supreme Court. He claims they’re totally out of touch with reality and that it’s really
their fault that the Depression hasn’t abated. It was a pure political power move (I think).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Roosevelt</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> announced after a landslide victory that he’s going to pack the Court
(that’s not what he called it, of course). He was going to destroy the Supreme Court as an institutional of
American government as it had heretofore existed because it was getting in the
way. The President was going to more or
less sweep the Supreme Court into the “dustbin of history” because they were
getting in the way!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Supreme Court justices read the newspaper and they pay attention to what’s
going on. They realize that they can’t
win this fight! They act to save their
institution! Ain’t this exciting?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Justice
Roberts switched sides! It seems like
what he did was switched his vote to save the institution. That worked! That was enough to shut </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
 '>Roosevelt</span></st1:place><span> up. The
Senate stopped holding hearings on the court-packing plan. “This is power politics! This is reality!”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
was a huge transformation in the understanding of the Commerce Clause. It didn’t happen by way of a constitutional amendment. </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:
 14.0pt;'>Roosevelt</span></st1:place><span> considered this but
rejected it. </span><st1:place><span
>Roosevelt</span></st1:place><span> felt that the only way you
could trust the Court was by packing the court. Thus, a whole new way of understanding the Commerce Clause emerged.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Wickard v.
Filburn</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
have some more appointments, but we have more or less the consolidation of </span><st1:place><span
>Roosevelt</span></st1:place><span>’s power. The ethos is: Congress can do pretty much
whatever it wants in the name of protecting the economy. It is instructive to compare <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Schecter Poultry</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wickard</i>. The tomatoes or wheat being grown at home are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>agricultural</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>local</i> in
the way that chickens are also <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agricultural
</i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>local</i>. Seven years after <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Schecter Poultry</i>, they go from saying “no you can’t regulate it” to
“yes you can”!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>These
cases are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not consistent </i>doctrinally. They represent two <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>radically different ways</i> of understanding the Commerce Clause.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Now
fast-forward to right before <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="unitedstatesvlopez.htm">Lopez</a></i>: between <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Wickard </i>in 1942 and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="unitedstatesvlopez.htm">Lopez</a></i> in 1995, the prevailing ethos is
that Congress can do whatever it wanted in an era of believing in Big Government
and the power of the federal government.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>President
Johnson talked about the Great Society. One of the critical aspects of the Great Society was the Civil Rights
Act and the idea that Congress would have the authority to protect civil
rights. The Act was justified under the Commerce
Clause. Think of Ollie’s Barbeque, a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really local </i>restaurant in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Alabama</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Congress says there can’t be any
discrimination there because restaurants are a form of commercial activity that
receives its products through the stream of interstate commerce! By the 1960’s, Congress can do that because
there’s a whole change in the understanding of the Commerce Clause. We will give Congress broad latitude to do
what they think is in the national interest.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
changes dramatically when we get to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="unitedstatesvlopez.htm">Lopez</a></i>.</span></p>

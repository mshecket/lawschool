<p><span>This
is our very last class of our first year of law school!!!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>More on the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i> briefs</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
kinds of questions will the Court want to ask at oral argument of the
respondents? What constitutes express
authorization by Congress? That’s an
issue from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Youngstown Sheet</i>. The use of force statute doesn’t say anything
about detention specifically. Maybe we
have two different statutes that point in opposite directions, and we could
construe either one of them to be controlling if we wanted to. Both statutes can be interpreted to apply,
and they conflict. Maybe we’re in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Youngstown Sheet</i> twilight zone! Neither side wants to argue that we’re in the
“maybe” box. One side wants “yes”, and
one side wants “no”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Justice Department wanted extra powers to deal with terrorism in light of
9/11. The PATRIOT Act is a big law. The Act expires on its own terms. It provides the President a lot more ability
to investigate foreigners. How will the
PATRIOT Act come into play? It might put
us more in the “twilight zone”. What if
Padilla was a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>member</i> of al <span
class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>? Would that be
enough to give the President authority? What about <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quirin</i></span>? That person was a member of the German
Army. It’s different being the German
Army versus membership in al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span> because </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Germany</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> is a country with a real
army and al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span> is not a country. But if Congress has said that we’re at war
with this paramilitary organization, then it would be argued that membership is
enough. There is a lot of back-and-forth
that will go on. This would be a harder
case for Padilla if he were a member of al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>. The other tricky hypothetical would be if
Padilla had been captured with the equipment necessary to build a dirty bomb. There must be some inherent authority of the
executive branch to protect the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> from radioactive bombs
blowing up. It would justify some kind
of original, temporary detention.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are two big issues: the detention is of a unilateral and indefinite nature
based on whatever evidence he thinks is appropriate without any judicial
review. On the other hand, you must
wonder to what extent the Court would be comfortable saying that there is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no military jurisdiction at all</i>. If the military had no role to play, then
someone who was working for a military power in an effort to blow up buildings
and kill people and who was caught is not subject to military authority. What the Court may do is rest on the fact
that we have neither membership nor any overt sign of belligerence. Either one by itself would be enough, perhaps
even in the “twilight zone” if that’s where we are. <span class=GramE>If the government catches
someone who is a member of a military organization that we are at war with, or
if they’re caught red-handed engaged in a military operation pursuant to the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>orders</i> of that organization, then either
one of those facts might give the President sufficient authority.</span> Padilla wasn’t caught red handed. He also isn’t alleged to be a member. In the absence of either of those facts, the
Court may say that he has to be prosecuted in civilian courts.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court may be nervous about accepting the government’s position in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i> in terms of the unilateral
authority the President is said to assert. There are implications for this in terms of the idea of liberty in the Constitution. The Court is going to go back into history to
reach some judgments about what is the appropriate position it should
take. If the Court says no to the
President in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i>, that would be a
historically significant act for the Court to take. Foley says that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Padilla</i> feels like a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really
big case</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>By
1984, the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Warren Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> seemed like ancient
history. But the distance between the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
 >Warren Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> and 1984 is the same twenty
years between the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Burger Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> and today. In 1984, we had no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Lawrence</i>, no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i>, and no <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Printz</i></span>. Constitutional Law ebbs and flows in ways
that are difficult to notice at any one moment. In terms of Separation of Powers, these cases about being in war weren’t
important. When you get a case like <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i> that links back to the earlier
periods like 1944, you find that there are some big themes that stay constant
in Constitutional Law even though it ebbs and flows. Some cases strike at the core of what the
country is all about. There were two big
developments during World War II. <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Korematsu</i></span> is
thought to be a terrible mistake. <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Barnette</i></span> was a First
Amendment case that was a great victory for liberty. It was a decision that said that
schoolchildren can’t be kicked out of school for failing to salute the flag. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Initially, they were ordered to salute the
flag, but the Court said that the concept of liberty in Constitutional Law is
strong enough to allow that dissent. Robert Jackson wrote the majority opinion in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Barnette</i></span> and wrote the dissent in
<span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Korematsu</i></span>. He seems to write opinions with extra power
and insight.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
point of Jackson’s dissent in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Korematsu</i></span> was that the courts sometimes can’t stop armies
from doing what they need to do. In <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Barnette</i></span>, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Jackson</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> told us that the role of
the courts and the Constitution are to protect those things that are beyond
voting.</span></p>

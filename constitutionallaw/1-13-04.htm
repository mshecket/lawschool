          wheat in his state or any other state. So he argued that the federal
          government must not be regulating his �commerce� when all he is doing
          is growing wheat at home and using it at home. The Court, in that
          case, said that if you take the one farmer together with other similar
          farmers there will be a substantial effect on interstate

          on the open market, and thus you�ve reduced the demand for wheat and

          Important lesson: if you�re talking to another lawyer and you�re not
          sure if you�re both talking about the same thing or you�re not sure

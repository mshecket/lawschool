          the Fourteenth Amendment. We now have a handout explaining the history
          of this doctrine of substantive due process. Without some history,
          it�s hard to understand. We�ll go back-to-back on Monday. We�ll go

        <span>The holding is pretty clear: the undergraduate program at </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          had a different method for admitting students. There are a lot of
          complex fact, but basically the admissions program evolved into a �20
          point plus� plan. If you�re a member of one of the three
          underrepresented minority groups, then you get a bonus. The holding of
          the case is that the fixed assignment of 20 points for being of a
          certain racial background is unconstitutional, even in the context of
          a plan that assigns points for many other soft factors. Interestingly,
          the university offers the same justification as the law school did.
          They assert a diversity interest and a selectivity interest. The
          majority opinion in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gratz</i> doesn�t dispute that
          these interests are compelling, as admitted in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Grutter</i>, but the 20 point
          plus factor approach is not narrowly tailored enough to achieve these
          compelling interests. Justice O�Connor writes a concurrence which is
          the most important one. It helps you line up
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Grutter</i> and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gratz</i> and how what the law
          school was doing was permissible but what the undergraduate school was
          doing was not.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One of the justifications that the undergraduate school supplied was
          administrative necessity: the undergraduate college got so many
          applications and it was such a large school relative to the law school
          that it couldn�t do the kind of file-by-file review that the law
          school was doing, but instead had to adopt a more structured approach
          to undergraduate admissions, and therefore it made sense to come up
          with specified point factors for all of these �soft� considerations.
          They argued that they were doing the same thing the law school was
          doing, but had to use the point system out of necessity because of the
          volume of their applications. The Court rejects this claim of
          necessity: this administrative necessity is not a compelling interest
          in itself. It doesn�t count as narrowly tailored. The Court tells the
          undergraduate program that they must adopt something like what the law
          school was doing. After the case came out, the university announced
          that they would hire many more undergraduate admissions officers so
          they could process applications file-by-file. Their argument turned
          out to be more about money: it would just cost more to look at
          applications file-by-file.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How do we understand the constitutional distinction that the Court
          here is adopting between what is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">impermissible</i> (the 20 extra
          points) and on the other hand, the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">permissibility</i> of the
          individualized file-by-file review in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Grutter</i>? The law school
          asserts that what it�s looking for in the context of individualized
          review is �critical mass�. The minority argued that �critical mass�
          converted the purported file-by-file review into effectively a quota
          system. The Court rejects that. The assignment of 20 points is
          obviously different from what occurred in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bakke</i>, which was a set
          aside for minority medical students, and the holding in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bakke</i> was that you can�t
          have that set aside. In
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gratz</i>, you don�t have that
          set-aside. 20 points may or may not be enough to get you admitted. If
          you scored more, or got a higher score from other factors, you would
          get admitted over a minority applicant who got 20 points but didn�t
          get a greater number of points than the other applicant. </span

        ><span>
          argued that it was consistent with
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bakke</i> that they didn�t have
          a set-aside because all applicants were completing against each other.
          The Court says that�s no good, that�s unconstitutional, but the goal
          of seeking �critical mass� is permissible.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >20 points for all minority members does not differentiate among the
          diversity <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">within </i>those
          groups. Maybe some African Americans grow up in suburbia and some grow
          up in the inner city. Maybe some of them have parents who are doctors
          or lawyers, and others have parents who didn�t go to college. O�Connor
          is concerned about how insufficiently attentive this system is to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">true</i> diversity.
          Socioeconomic diversity and racial diversity aren�t the same
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">kind</i> of diversity.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But then to look at the same question from a different angle, Justice
          Powell in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bakke</i> did not use
          the term �critical mass�, and the Harvard plan did not use that term.
          The plaintiffs in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Grutter</i> say that when the
          law school searches for �critical mass�, they�re not using race as a
          �tiebreaker�. �Critical mass� seems to be different: from the
          beginning of the admissions process, you�re looking to make sure that
          the entering class has a certain proportion of entering students of a
          certain background. There is some notion of sufficiency. The
          plaintiffs say this is a quota. But the Court in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Grutter</i> rejects that
          argument. There has been variation from 12% to 20% in minority
          backgrounds at </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. This range is inconsistent with a quota, according to the
          Court.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >It�s not enough that you have a compelling interest here. It seems
          that it�s essential to the success of the law school�s claim in this
          case that it�s open to the possibility year to year that they
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">fail</i> to reach �critical
          mass�. That�s the difference between a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">quota</i> and a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">goal</i>, or a quota and a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">target</i>. Race cannot be
          outcome-determinative regardless of other considerations. Justice
          O�Connor thus ties the idea of fluctuation to flexibility.
          Fluctuation, in her mind, is a product of a process that is
          sufficiently flexible so race is never entitled to be mechanically or
          rigidly outcome-determinative. We�ll look at race as one factor, but
          if it turns out in our applicant pool in a given year that we�re not
          able to achieve �critical mass�, then we don�t, and we don�t let that
          factor override all other factors.</span

          >We may all have views on this stuff, but ultimately we need to know
          what the Court thinks about the issues so we can represent clients in
          Court. For example, are the LSATs inherently racist? But on the other
          hand, will the current U.S. Supreme Court pay attention to this?
          Probably not.</span

          did a good job, it seems. They got five votes for the law school
          program. It wasn�t obvious beforehand that the votes would be there.
          We knew O�Connor would cast the swing vote, but we didn�t know which
          way it would go. In this part of the class, much more so than with the
          Commerce Clause or executive privilege, figuring out the line between
          a policy argument and a legal argument is really tricky and not
          clear-cut.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One of the issues that we talked about yesterday, and one of the
          issues that�s lurking in this case is whether we can trust Boalt Hall
          and </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          to be honest about what they�re doing. We�d like to think we can trust
          them because they are law schools and law professors, but we should
          put that on the table. The majority opinion�s only response is the
          deference that is given to the university as a university, where the
          university tells us that they are looking at these reports in no rigid
          way and they don�t change what they�re doing based on the use of the
          reports. That�s not convincing to the dissenters, but that�s what the
          majority says.</span

          was an example of �rational basis with bite�. In this case, it seems
          like they�re applying a more relaxed version of strict scrutiny. It is
          debatable whether this scrutiny is as strict as it was in other
          cases.</span

        <span
          >What about this 25-year sunset thing? It may be an effort to narrow
          the ruling in a particular way. It seems to be O�Connor�s view that
          even considering diversity is a compelling interest because it goes to
          the legitimacy of our government, she seems to say that it has a time
          limit on it. The use of race cannot be unlimited and open-ended, not
          withstanding the necessity of the government being legitimate to its
          citizens. You would think it would be imperative to have diversity and
          the means to achieve it no matter what!

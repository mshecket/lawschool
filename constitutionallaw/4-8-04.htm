        <span
          >We�re going to look at the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Glucksberg</i>-related list.
          What if you refuse, while conscious, to be hooked up to artificial
          respiration? Do you have a constitutionally protected right to be
          hooked up in that sense? Yes! It�s just the same as refusing food and
          water. But where does that constitutional right come from? If you had
          to write a brief on this, what would you point to that shows that this
          right exists? You could cite to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Cruzan</i>. In that decision,
          we assumed that the United States Constitution would grant a
          constitutionally protected right to refuse life-saving hydration and
          nutrition. That case might not explicitly reference artificial
          respiration, but you can certainly draw the parallel. But there isn�t
          going to be anything on the face on the Constitution that says that
          there is any such right. This is a substantive due process right.
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Cruzan</i> is a Supreme Court
          precedent that acknowledges this right. But the Supreme Court hedges
          on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Cruzan</i> slightly. After
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Glucksberg</i>, though, the
          assumption is pretty strong.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >What gives the Supreme Court the power to say that substantive due
          process provides for this specific right? They point to history and
          tradition. The Court finds that tradition shows a recognized right to
          personal physical integrity. For example, the common law tort of
          battery shows that it is considered a wrong to touch someone in any
          way without their position. Then again, a battery statute could be
          passed to exclude doctors protecting life. The Court suggests,
          however, that this statute may be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">unconstitutional</i> under
          substantive due process. A common law idea that has been around from
          time immemorial may take on constitutional status! Wow�</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why should tradition and history be a guide in answering substantive
          due process questions? What is important about history and tradition?
          Slavery is part of our history and traditions!
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Dred Scott</i> was the first
          substantive due process case! The Due Process Clause of the Fifth
          Amendment was used to say that Congress had no right to disallow
          slavery in the new territories. A slaveholder claimed that slavery was
          protected by the Constitution under the Due Process Clause! So should
          tradition really be the benchmark for evaluating substantive due
          process claims??? Maybe it can be argued that the good parts of our
          country come from innovation rather than looking backwards.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Recall that the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Cruzan</i> case represented a
          situation where the patient was in a coma and she hadn�t given any
          advance directive. There was a debate over what her wishes and
          intentions were. If you�re unconscious and injured, emergency medical
          personnel will default to helping you out if they have no information
          to the contrary.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Scalia would say that if you could find the existence of a tradition
          at the most specific way you could articulate it, that was the
          tradition that the Court was bound to follow, even if you could
          articulate a more general tradition. The reason to adopt this approach
          would be to make justices more objective and less dependent on their
          own preferences. If they could choose to look at their judgments more
          broadly, it would be easier to find a tradition that fits your
          particular preferences.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Justice Brennan says that the right level of tradition shouldn�t be
          found just in terms of specifics, but in terms of the general idea
          that the Constitution is supposed to protect liberty and protect
          minorities against the majority. Thus, it would be argued, that we
          should look at the spirit and purpose of the Constitution when
          searching for tradition. Therefore, don�t worry about the narrow
          historical record.</span

      <p>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span>Casey</span></i
        ><span>
          rejects the notion of searching for tradition at the narrow level and
          instead says that the Court�s cases aren�t consistent with that. With
          respect to the right to marry, in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Loving v. Virginia</i>,
          involving interracial marriage, the Court said that if we look at
          tradition narrowly, American history supported a narrow conception of
          marriage and allowed the states to punish interracial marriages and
          make them crimes and that that tradition existed for long periods of
          time after even the Civil War and the Fourteenth Amendment. But in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Loving</i>, the Court didn�t
          look at tradition narrowly, but rather it adopted a more expansive
          view of tradition, allowing a broader understanding of reproductive
          freedom.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Scalia�s rejoinder on
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Loving</i> would be to say that
          it was true that the Court relied
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in part</i> on substantive due
          process, but the Court could have relied
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">just</i> on Equal Protection
          Clause and the fact that racial discrimination is unconstitutional.
          Scalia would deny that substantive due process was necessary to reach
          the decision! Therefore, he would say that you shouldn�t use that
          precedent to justify a more expansive interpretation.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Constitution expresses sets of competing values! The liberal
          justices argue that the Constitution is a document that advocates for
          liberty on its face. Souter, in particular, argues for a more
          philosophical and a less history or tradition-oriented approach. The
          �exercise of human reason�, it is claimed, can identify
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">objectively right answers</i>
          to these questions. The use of human reason can discern when liberty
          should be protected in a fundamental way. Justice Harlan talked about
          the use of �reasoned judgment�. But the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Glucksberg</i> majority rejects
          this approach. Several leading American moral philosophers wrote an
          amicus brief in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Glucksberg</i>.
          John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, and some other leading philosophers
          advocated the view that reason shows that physician-assisted suicide
          is no different morally than refusing treatment, as in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Cruzan</i>. The majority
          opinion in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Glucksberg</i> emphatically
          rejects the pure philosophical approach to substantive due process.
          They say that it doesn�t matter what the philosophers say, because
          they can�t use the concept of due process to override the judgment of
          legislatures. There is a great tension between the approach the Court
          takes in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Glucksberg</i> versus
          the approach the Court has taken in the abortion cases so far.</span

          allegedly fighting alongside the Taliban. He was caught in the zone of
          combat with an AK-47 in his hand. He was captured abroad, not on U.S.
          soil, and he was captured in a context where the government alleges
          that he was in a combat posture as a member of the Taliban militia, if
          not an enlisted member of their army. That case went up through the
          Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that the president has the
          authority to detain <span class="SpellE">Hamdi</span>.

          raised many of the same issues as Padilla. It is claimed that the

          <span class="SpellE">Qaeda</span>. Why is it important to find out if
          there was a judicial finding of fact? What evidence does the court
          have that Padilla has al <span class="SpellE">Qaeda</span> ties?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We haven�t taken Evidence, but we have taken Criminal Law. If this
          were a criminal trial, has the government presented any evidence
          against Padilla? There is a declaration by Michael
          <span class="SpellE">Mobbs</span>. He isn�t a witness before the
          court. He didn�t sign an affidavit. What about the hearsay rule?
          You�re not allowed to testify to what
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">someone else </i>said. You can
          only testify to what
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">you</i> know.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>From a legal standpoint,
          there�s nothing here that counts as evidence that Padilla has ties to
          al <span class="SpellE">Qaeda</span> or was involved in a plot to
          detonate a dirty bomb. The court can�t make any findings of fact
          because no facts have been presented. The government asserts that they
          need not provide any such evidence, but need only assert that the
          president has made this determination.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are sealed and unsealed declarations. The sealed declaration
          asserts that there is evidence, but that evidence hasn�t been
          presented judicially. Even the sealed version just says that people in
          the Justice Department have evidence. That evidence has not been
          presented in court. That doesn�t necessarily mean anything, but it�s
          just a fact about how the litigation is proceeding. This is a lot
          different from an ordinary criminal trial context. In that context,
          you couldn�t lock Padilla up indefinitely until he is convicted.
          Everything Padilla is accused of doing is a crime and he could have
          been prosecuted in an ordinary criminal proceeding.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The government doesn�t want a criminal trial in this context. They
          don�t want to have to expose who their secret witnesses are. So: Can
          the government lock someone up who they think is a bad guy without a
          criminal trial if they don�t want to have one?</span

          bombing. Suppose that was the work of a larger conspiracy than just
          Timothy McVeigh involving, for example, a militia-type organization.
          The government captures McVeigh but wants to prosecute the people he�s
          working for. If the government thinks that McVeigh is guilty, they
          must put him on trial!</span

          president <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">does</i> have the
          authority to impose such a transfer based on the president�s own
          determination that Padilla is an enemy combatant. We might ask
          whether, on the president�s theory of the case, he would have to do
          anything more than
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">assert </i>that Padilla is an
          enemy combatant. But that�s not what he did; he attached the

          agents from having their cover blown. But also, there are lots of
          evidentiary problems. The �evidence� in the military papers has
          nothing to do with �evidence as advocacy�, but only with �evidence as
          fact�.</span

          indefinitely, there is

          over this. The District Court and dissent don�t believe that this is a
          probably criminal trial. There may be a small fact-finding role to
          take place: a �some evidence� standard.</span

          the <span class="SpellE">Mobbs</span> declaration gets tested in court
          is important, but also rests on some basic legal questions that will
          soon be decided.</span

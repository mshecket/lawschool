          >So does the Federal Constitution require a state to extend the right
          to marry to homosexual couples on the same terms that it grants such
          rights to heterosexual couples? The majority isn�t explicitly ready to
          take such a step. The opinion suggests sort of the reverse of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Grutter</i>�s sunset provision.
          Maybe in 25 years, gay marriage will be allowed. How can this be
          justified as a legal judgment? The individuals who are on the Court
          now would vote to say that the Constitution doesn�t require equality
          of marriage as a matter of Con Law.</span

          majority, if a law is only motivated by a moral purpose with no
          constitutional standing, it flunks. As far as O�Connor goes, equal
          protection applies to civil law. O�Connor says that it�s a violation
          of the Equal Protection Clause to deny gay citizens of </span

          of intimate relations. Wouldn�t it be the exact same denial of
          equality to say that gays can�t marry? Is the Supreme Court really
          doing its job of interpreting and enforcing the Constitution? Did the

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i>? Here�s one way to
          understand <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i> and the
          concept of �unenumerated rights�. James Madison, when he wrote the
          list of rights in the Bill of Rights and submitted it to the states,
          did not include a right of marriage because he thought it was so
          obvious. The idea that Congress could take that right away was so far
          fetched that there was no reason to say anything. He talked about the
          things that people were afraid that the American government would do
          because tyrannical governments like the British government did them.
          He also said: �This isn�t a complete list of all the things that
          tyrannical governments do. The Ninth Amendment says that there are
          other rights that should be protected but aren�t listed.� If you asked
          James Madison whether the right to marry was fundamental, he would
          say: �Absolutely.� Once the right to marry is worthy of constitutional
          status, then a new aspect (contraception) comes along and you can
          argue that it must be protected as
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">part of</i> that essential
          right. That would be a way to understand
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Griswold</i>, at least
          narrowly. That�s a way to add a constitutional right even thought it�s
          not mentioned.</span

          would have said: �Of course we�re not protecting gay marriage. The
          right of heterosexual marriage is protected.� But what about

          would have said that miscegenation laws are okay. But we could argue
          that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment came
          along later. But then
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bowers</i> makes sense on its
          own terms when it refers to American history and tradition. The kind
          of move that you can make with respect to race discrimination in

          Foley predicted that the majority would go with O�Connor. The majority
          went out of their way to embrace the substantive due process issue.
          They wanted to go out of their way to show that laws like the </span

the district court deferred ruling on the government's separation of powers
claim, explaining that &quot;after discovery, the government may prevail on
summary judgment on statutory grounds without the need for this Court to
address the constitutionality of applying FACA [to the Vice President].&quot;

a motion for summary judgment based on the &quot;administrative record.&quot;
According to the government, the administrative record consists of the
President's memorandum creating the NEPDG, the <span class=SpellE>NEPDG's</span>

demonstrates the strictness of the mandamus standard, but also largely controls
the disposition of this case. There, <a name="SDU_31"></a>plaintiff alleged,
among other things, that President Clinton's personal staff and other White
House units that advise and assist the President were maintaining FBI files of
former political appointees in violation of the Privacy Act. The district court
denied the government's motion to dismiss, ordered discovery, and rejected the
White House's assertion of the attorney client, deliberative process, and work
product privileges. The government then sought a writ of mandamus to vacate the
district court's discovery order with respect to one particular interrogatory.
The government also argued that without mandamus relief &quot;the President's
interactions with his closest advisors will be irreparably damaged in the
future, because the District Court has sought to coerce the White House, on
threat of criminal sanction, into following a view of the Privacy Act to which
it does not subscribe.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

Noting that &quot;[a]<span class=SpellE>lmost</span> the entire thrust of [the
government's] petition is that the District Court erred in concluding that the
White House is subject to the Privacy Act,&quot; we explained that &quot;[e]<span
class=SpellE>ven</span> assuming, <span class=SpellE>arguendo</span>, that the
District Court's holding on the scope of the Privacy Act is clear error,
mandamus relief is not warranted in this case. This is so because, on the
record at hand, there has been no showing of harm of the sort required to
justify the drastic remedy of mandamus.&quot; Further, although acknowledging
that &quot; 'disclosure [of highly privileged material] followed by appeal
after final <a name="SDU_32"></a>judgment is obviously not adequate in such
cases--the cat is out of the bag,' &quot; (bracketed material in original), we
observed that &quot;[<span class=SpellE>i</span>]n the normal course, ...
mandamus is not available to review a discovery order,&quot; We then denied the
request for mandamus, explaining that the government &quot;offered ... no
argument that it is even entitled to the privileges,&quot; and that &quot;[a]<span
class=SpellE>bsent</span> a viable claim that some important privilege will be
infringed if discovery is allowed to proceed, this court has no jurisdiction to
review the interlocutory order on this ground.&quot; As to the government's
fear that the district court might hold White House staff in criminal contempt,
we explained, &quot;the District Court has no free- wheeling authority to run
the affairs of the White House with *1103 **281<a

participation in the work of the NEPDG, the district court has &quot;brought to

<p><span style='mso-bookmark:StarPage'><span style='font-size:
18.0pt'>First, as petitioners concede, plaintiffs' cause of action against the
Vice President arises not under the APA, but under the Mandamus Act. Moreover,
even if APA review standards apply to mandamus actions--a question we need not
resolve here--the rule that APA review is generally limited to the
administrative record has two exceptions: &quot;when there has been a 'strong
showing of bad faith or improper behavior' or when the record is so bare that
it prevents effective judicial review.&quot; <span style='background:red;
mso-highlight:red'>Petitioners argue that plaintiffs have not made the
&quot;strong showing&quot; required by the first exception.</span> This is
true, but plaintiffs do not invoke the first exception. Instead, they rely on
the second exception, arguing that the record is inadequate to resolve the
statutory issue pending before the district court. As they point out, the
President's memorandum establishing the NEPDG and the <span class=SpellE>NEPDG's</span>
final report tell us only that the <span class=SpellE>NEPDG's</span> members
were all federal employees. The two documents reveal nothing about whether,
notwithstanding the President's appointment of only federal officials,
non-federal personnel participated in the work of the NEPDG &quot;as if they were
members of the NEPDG.&quot; <a name="SDU_34"></a>Although the Knutson affidavit
does address this question, because the government submitted it during
litigation, it is not itself part of the administrative record.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

that &quot;in the circumstances of this case, ... extending the legislative and

court's discovery order, petitioners choose to invoke executive or any other
privilege, that court, keeping in mind the need to &quot;accord[ ] high respect

privilege, thus giving petitioners all the relief they seek here. On the other
hand, were the district court to reject a claim of executive privilege, thus
creating an imminent *1105 **283 risk of disclosure of allegedly protected
presidential communications, then mandamus might well be appropriate to avoid
letting &quot;the cat ... out of the bag.&quot; But so long as the separation

The second answer to petitioners' argument is that their worry about
&quot;unnecessarily broad&quot; discovery can be resolved in the district court.
<span style='background:red;mso-highlight:red'>According to petitioners,
discovery is excessive because (1) they have already produced some 36,000 pages

18.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><br>
<span style='background:lime;mso-highlight:lime'>The district court has already
addressed the first concern. In its order approving plaintiffs' discovery plan,
the district court expressly stated: &quot;[S]<span class=SpellE>hould</span>
defendants believe that documents or information that they have already
released to plaintiffs in different <span class=SpellE>fora</span> are
responsive to these discovery requests, defendants shall bear the burden of

taken.</span></span><span style='mso-bookmark:StarPage'><span style='font-size:

minutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, studies, agenda, or other
documents which were made available to or prepared for or by [the] ...
committee.&quot; Yet plaintiffs' discovery seeks far more than these limited
items. <span style='background:aqua;mso-highlight:aqua'>Their third
interrogatory, for example, asks for the names of &quot;all Task Force staff,
personnel, consultants, employees, and all other persons who participated, in
any manner, in the activities of the Task Force or the preparation of the
Report.&quot; The fourth interrogatory asks that &quot;[f]or each person listed
in response to Interrogatory <span class=GramE>3, ...</span> please provide ...
a description of the person's role in the activities of the Task Force and in
preparation of the Report.&quot;</span> The requests to produce also go well
beyond <span class=SpellE>FACA's</span> requirements. For example, the first
request seeks &quot;[a]<span class=SpellE>ll</span> documents identifying or
referring to any staff, personnel, contractors, consultants or employees of the
Task Force.&quot; As petitioners point out, if plaintiffs are entitled to
&quot;discovery ... roughly coextensive with the available remedies for a FACA
violation, then the textual exemption of advisory groups including only
government officials, which presumably was designed to protect against undue
interference with executive functions, has little practical effect.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bookmark:StarPage'><span style='font-size:

<a name="SDU_41"></a>Plaintiffs' discovery also goes well beyond what they need
to prove, as they allege, that FACA applies to the NEPDG, i.e., that
non-federal officials participated to the extent that they were effectively
NEPDG members. <span style='background:lime;mso-highlight:lime'>For example,
plaintiffs have no need for the names of &quot;all ... persons&quot; who

<p><span style='mso-bookmark:StarPage'><span style='font-size:

Although petitioners did raise the question of excessive discovery in the
district court, they did so in support of their plea for a &quot;protective
order relieving [defendants] of <i>any</i> obligation to respond to plaintiffs'

anything we have said here, on appeal following final judgment. In the
meantime, narrow, carefully focused discovery will fully protect the Vice
President: Either the Vice President will have no need to claim privilege, or
if he does, then the district court's express willingness to entertain
privilege claims and to review allegedly privileged documents in camera will
prevent any harm. Moreover, such measures will enable the district court to resolve
the statutory question--whether FACA applies to the NEPDG--without
&quot;sweeping intrusions into the Presidency and Vice Presidency.&quot; And if
after limited discovery, it turns out that no non-federal personnel
participated as de facto NEPDG members, the district court will never have to
face the serious constitutional issue lurking in this case--whether FACA can be
constitutionally applied to the President and Vice President. If, on the other
hand, the district court not only determines that FACA applies to the NEPDG,
but also rejects petitioners' constitutional challenge to the application of
the Act, both issues can be fully addressed on appeal following final judgment.<br>

that it ignores </span></span><a

has jurisdiction to entertain plaintiffs' mandamus action. Plaintiffs may or
may not prevail, but under the law of this circuit, the district court's
jurisdiction is not in doubt. According to the dissent's theory, moreover, all
statutory defenses to mandamus actions become jurisdictional, allowing
defendants who fail to prevail on motions to dismiss to seek immediate
appellate review. <span style='background:lime;mso-highlight:lime'>Nothing in

I suspect that, on remand, the Government may be able effectively to challenge
the breadth of the disputed discovery order. I also suspect that, once these
objections have been raised, the District Court will tailor the discovery
order. Until the Government voices its objections, however, this court has no
jurisdiction to meddle in a dispute over a discovery issue that <a name="SDU_51"></a>should

Rather, this case focuses principally on the Government's request for mandamus
relief. Mandamus &quot;is reserved for <i>extraordinary circumstances</i> in
which the petitioner demonstrates that his right to issuance of the writ is
clear and indisputable and that no other adequate means to obtain relief
exist.&quot; &quot;[O]<span class=SpellE>nly</span> exceptional circumstances

the invocation of this extraordinary remedy.&quot; Applying this
well-understood test, the Government can point to no basis for mandamus at this
juncture, because it can point to no harm. And it can point to no harm because
it has yet to specify any privileged materials or otherwise cite objections for
consideration by the District Court. It is not enough for the Government to
come to this court and claim that discovery <i>may</i> expose materials that
are protected by privilege or the deliberative process. It must first specify
its objections so that they may be addressed by the District Court.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

Finally, most of the arguments raised in the dissenting opinion have never been
presented to the District Court and they were not raised for consideration in
the Government's brief to this court or in the oral argument before this court.
In other words, the dissent's position rests on a view of FACA that has never
been urged by the Government. <span style='background:fuchsia;mso-highlight:

court is justified in resolving an issue not passed on below, as where the
proper resolution is beyond any doubt, or where 'injustice might otherwise
result.' Suffice it to say that this is not such a case.&quot;</span> The
reason that a federal appellate court normally does not consider an issue not
passed upon below is because parties, such as plaintiffs in this case,
&quot;should have the opportunity to present whatever legal arguments [they]
may have in defense of the statute.&quot; The dissent's theory of this case has
not been propounded by the Government; it runs counter to the law of the
circuit; and it relies on GSA regulations that the Supreme Court has said do
not carry the force of law. In these circumstances, I can see no reasonable

The case comes to us in a peculiar posture. We have mandamus on top of
mandamus. Both sides have invoked the All Writs Act. The federal officers have
petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus barring discovery. In the district

&quot;drastic&quot;; it is available only in &quot;extraordinary
situations&quot;; it is hardly ever granted; those invoking the court's
mandamus jurisdiction must have a &quot;clear and indisputable&quot; right to
relief. These words are directed at the federal officers' petition in this
court, but they apply equally to plaintiffs' suits in the district court. In my
view, the federal officers have a clear right to relief in the court of appeals
because the plaintiffs do not have a clear right to relief in the district
court. I would therefore grant the writ and order the district court not only
to bar discovery but to dismiss the actions.<a name="SDU_59"></a><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

create a cause of action. It is also clear that the Administrative Procedure
Act, which plaintiffs invoked, does not apply. The alleged FACA &quot;advisory
committee&quot; here was not an &quot;agency&quot; within the meaning of the
APA. It was part of the Executive Office of the President. The President is not
subject to the APA, and neither are units within the Executive Office whose

Bush sought advice on energy policy. To that end, he established, in the
Executive Office of the President, the National Energy Policy Development

Secretaries of Treasury, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Transportation, and
Energy; the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; the
Administrator of the Environment Protection Agency; and three Assistants to the
President. The President authorized the Vice President to invite &quot;as
appropriate, other officers of the Federal Government.&quot; The Group's mission
was to &quot;develop a national energy policy designed to help the private
sector&quot; and State and local governments, &quot;to gather information,
deliberate, and ... make recommendations to the President.&quot; In May 2001
the Group issued its recommendations to the President. The Group's final report

invites a comparative judgment. One cannot know whether a private individual
acted like a member of a Presidential committee unless one knows how the
members acted. And so plaintiffs proposed, and the district court approved,
free range discovery: interrogatories asking for descriptions of all the
activities of all individuals - members *1115 **293 and staff alike - who were
involved in the work of the Energy Policy Group, and requests for documents
detailing all communications between those working for the Group and their

no standards. And my colleagues never articulate their conception of <i>de

depositions, interrogatories, and document production. Consider just a few of
the possibilities. Suppose it turns out that a private individual attended 6 of
the Group's 12 meetings. Would that make him a <i>de <a name="SDU_64"></a>facto</i>
member? Would it matter if discovery revealed that some of the members the
President appointed attended the same number of, or even fewer, meetings? What
if the private individual attended all meetings but did not speak, or was
present only for a short period each time? Would it matter whether the private
individual had a place at the table or sat on the side with the Group's staff?
Or whether the private individual attended only a few meetings, but was quite
influential in the formulation of the final recommendations? Should there be
discovery into what impact the person's presence or statements had on the other
members, and how would that discovery proceed? Suppose the private individual
submitted memoranda or other documents. Is there to be discovery for the
purpose of determining whether the other members of the Group took those
documents into account in performing their information gathering function or in
formulating their view of energy policy? (One of the complaints alleges that a
corporate CEO handed the Vice President a three-page memorandum on the subject
of energy.) Would it be of any consequence that the private person met
individually with some of the members the President appointed? (There are also
allegations to this effect.) And if so, is there to be discovery of who said
what, and how this affected the work of the Group?<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

The majority also maintains that there is no &quot;harm&quot; to the <span

privilege that might be available. Maj. <span class=GramE>op</span>. <a

that the only potential harm would be in the revelation of privileged material
and that the federal officers are fully capable of making sure this does not
occur. If this *1117 **295<a name="citeas((Cite_as:_334_F.3d_1096,_*1117,__"> </a>were
an adequate answer, department heads and agency officials would regularly be
subject to discovery; they too could protect themselves by asserting
privileges.<br>
The majority's no-harm proposition is especially ill founded in this case. The
Energy Policy Group was part of the Executive Office of the President. If
executive privilege is to be asserted, it therefore appears that the President
must make the decision. &quot;There must be a formal claim of privilege, lodged
by the head of the department which has control over the matter, after actual
personal consideration by that officer.&quot; Already the government has
voluntarily produced some 36,000 pages of documents in this matter. How many
additional documents are potentially subject to discovery we do not know. But
it is obvious that decisions to assert privileges must be made document by
document and often line by line. With respect to interrogatories and
depositions, the decisions about privilege must be made question by question.
Each such assertion will trigger <a name="SDU_70"></a>yet another round of
proceedings in the district court, unless the plaintiffs acquiesce in the
President's judgment. In all of this the President will be distracted and
diverted from the performance of his constitutional duties and

If Congress, in order to ensure that outsiders did not have &quot;undue
influence,&quot; had passed a law requiring all groups within the Executive
Office of the President to disclose publicly not only their advice to the
President but also all their records, I am confident the law would be struck
down as a violation of the separation of powers. My confidence in the
unconstitutionality of such a law is not lessened by the prospect that the
President might resist some disclosure by invoking executive privilege.
Discovery on the basis of allegations of <i>de facto</i> membership cannot be
distinguished from <a name="SDU_71"></a>such a law. Any Presidential committee
that consults anyone outside of government, or is suspected to have done so, is
potentially subject to discovery into its inner workings. All a plaintiff has
to do is bring a mandamus action and allege that private individuals had some
ill-defined role in a committee of federal officers advising the President. And
according to the majority opinion, the court of appeals is powerless to prevent
this.<br>

target="_top"><i>Skidmore,</i></a> <a name="FN;B01010"></a>I would apply the
regulation to this case in light of the problems of adhering to the <i>de facto</i>
member doctrine of <a

target="_top"><i>AAPS</i></a>. The regulation has the added advantage of
enabling the President, at the time of formation of his committee, to determine
whether the committee must comply with the many requirements FACA imposes. The <i>de
facto</i> membership doctrine, in contrast, will almost invariably require an
after-the- <a name="SDU_76"></a>fact determination, contemplating as it does an
examination of what role a private individual played throughout the committee's
life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The Court gave several reasons, among which were that the regulation was not a
&quot;contemporaneous construction&quot; of FACA because it was not promulgated
until years after the statute came into effect, and that GSA's regulations did
&quot;carry the force of law.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:18.0pt'><br>
In short, I would issue the writ of mandamus and send the case back to the
district court with instructions to dismiss the complaints.<br>

          >States are trying, in general, to hide their protectionism. One of
          the early stages of the <span class="SpellE">lawyering</span> process
          in one of these cases is to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">expose</i> the hidden
          protectionism. In the real world, there is plenty of time to unearth
          all the relevant facts.</span

          >The question of the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >market participation exception </i
          >is whether the state is acting like a regulator, or whether the state
          is entering the marketplace as if it were just a business. If the
          state enters the marketplace as a business, then its activities that
          favor in-state businesses are exempt from Dormant Commerce Clause
          analysis. The state isn�t using its sovereign power to engage in
          protectionism. Instead, the state is simply operating as a
          company.</span

          ><st1:PlaceType><span>State</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place

        ><span>
          rule is a 10% limit and it is facially discriminatory. It�s not a
          subsidy. It�s a classic example of state coercion where there is a
          different rule for out-of-state hunters than in-state hunters. The
          state won in the district court, but the Court of Appeals reversed and
          remanded. They found that they district court was ridiculous for not
          finding a Commerce Clause issue.</span

        <span>How can the </span

        ><span>

          does it have for saying that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">our</i> citizens can hunt elk
          and deer but citizens from other states can�t? What is the legitimate
          interest that </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Arizona</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> asserts? </span

          ><st1:place><span>Arizona</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          says that they are worried about depleting their elk and deer
          population. They are afraid that if they have too much elk and deer
          hunting, they will disappear. They want to conserve the species.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>But is there a non-discriminatory way for the state of </span

          ><st1:place><span>Arizona</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          to protect this interest? The state has the burden of showing that
          there are no alternatives. It�s great if </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Arizona</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span>
          wants to protect their deer and elk. But can�t they do it without
          discrimination against out-of-<span class="SpellE">staters</span>?
          Sure they could! They could issue permits for such-and-such number of
          elk, and give them out without respect to what state you�re from. They
          could set limits that don�t discriminate!</span

          that exist in all the states: the importation of alcohol and the
          �three-tier� system (retail, wholesale, manufacturers). In some
          states, there can be direct sale to consumers of alcohol. But there is
          no direct sale to consumers from out-of-state wineries. Wineries want
          to sell wine on the Internet. They want to cut out the �middlemen�.
          The states are saying that they can�t do that. A lot of
          <span class="SpellE">lawyering</span> has gone into making arguments
          on both sides of the issue. A three-judge panel in the Sixth Circuit
          says, unanimously: �You can�t do it!� But a three-judge panel in the
          Second Circuit says, also unanimously, and before the same alcohol

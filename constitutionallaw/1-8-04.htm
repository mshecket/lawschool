        <span
          >We�re going to see a Commerce Clause question that Foley is giving to
          his Legal Writing students. This will serve as real-world
          constitutional question of the kind that we�ll be reading in this
          class. Think about this problem in light of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lopez</i> which we�ll be
          reading for Monday.</span

        <span
          >Foley�s exams are essay-based and sometimes take-home. What he�s
          looking for in exam answer is the same stuff he looks for as a Legal
          Writing instructor. He wants good writing! He wants clear arguments.
          You can use the knowledge you gain from Legal Writing to supplement
          what we do in this class.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Does Congress have the power to ban machine guns? It depends on how
          you interpret the Second Amendment. Some say it applies to
          individuals, while others say it only applies to militias.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Just who takes these opposing points of view? There are interest
          groups with strongly held political views and they don�t all
          agree.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Foley thinks there would be a way to read
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Miller</i> in a way that�s not
          so sweeping as the way Chemerinsky wants to read it. The gun in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Miller</i> was a sawed-off
          shotgun, not just any gun. The Court said that you have no right to
          own a gun that no real military could own. That�s actually a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">partial</i> acceptance of the
          view that the meaning of the Second Amendment is controlled by its
          militia function, but Foley says it�s not as sweeping as Chemerinsky
          claims. Maybe another kind of weapon that does have a military
          function could be the basis of an individual rights claim. You could
          claim that you have an individual right to own a weapon that has a
          militia function.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >One Circuit said that there�s no individual right to own a machine
          gun, but Foley sees this as an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">extension </i>of the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Miller </i>precedent, not
          necessarily as following that precedent.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >As lawyers trying to find out the answer to the question of whether
          the government has the power to ban machine guns, we look to judicial
          precedent. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Miller</i> is the
          most important precedent because it�s the most recent case to come out
          of the United States Supreme Court.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Assume for the basis of argument that the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Miller</i> precedent does not
          exist. The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Miller</i> case is
          old, and there has been an effort both inside and outside the judicial
          system to overturn <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Miller</i>.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>In fact, the current
          Department of Justice has informed the United States Supreme Court
          that the current government believes that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Miller</i> is wrong. The
          Supreme Court has neither accepted nor rejected this argument, but
          there is the sense that the Supreme Court might someday revisit this
          issue as a case of �first impression� as if
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Miller</i> didn�t exist at all.
          That would be a rejection of stare decisis. Let�s suppose this
          happens.</span

          government in all its agencies is represented in litigation by the
          Solicitor General, who works within the Department of Justice. There
          is a long history of the relationship between the Supreme Court as the
          representative of the judicial branch and the Solicitor General as the
          representative of the executive branch. By tradition, the Supreme
          Court has seen the Solicitor General as a member of the Supreme Court
          bar and thus having a close relationship with the United States
          Supreme Court.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">politics</i>? This is a big
          question we�ll need to consider. Is figuring out what the law is
          exclusively a political judgment, or is it independent of political
          judgments? Even if you think the judges are purely or partly
          political, you can�t behave in court as if you think so. You might
          have to tell your client that, but you can�t say it in court.</span

          mode. We use the language of the law and cite precedent. We do legal

      <p>
        <span
          >The �external� perspective is more of a critical appraisal of the
          situation. You look at the legal system from the outside and ask
          whether the judges are doing law or whether they�re just doing
          politics. This is the perspective where you get cynical and ask
          �what�s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">really</i> going

          categories correlate with objectivity/subjectivity or modern
          values/traditional values? Not necessarily. Even judges who reject

          to impose their own personal and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">subjective</i> values on their
          interpretation. Whatever the judges find, they must be objective, if

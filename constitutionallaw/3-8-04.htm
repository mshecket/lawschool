12.0pt'>On the other hand, government agents may be motivated by an animus
against a certain group. For example,
imagine a government official will not declare anyone who is gay “morally fit”
to practice law. We could call this a discriminatory
animus or discriminatory motive that gets you within the equal protection
analysis. Or consider police officers
who desire to pull over black drivers for speeding more often than white
drivers. But what if the police officers
are unaware of why they’re doing what they’re doing? What if they have a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>subconscious bias</i>? What if,
on the other hand, they are applying objective criteria with the result being a
discriminatory impact?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Levels of scrutiny</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are three levels of scrutiny that the Court employs to evaluate intentional discrimination
(either facial discrimination or discriminatory motive): (1) strict scrutiny,
(2) intermediate scrutiny, and (3) low-level scrutiny.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
should remind us of Justice Jackson’s three categories. These too are artificial boxes. Some justices want to blur the lines and look
at a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>spectrum</i> of scrutiny instead of
discrete boxes. But for the sake of
simplicity to start out, let’s assume that there exist these three well-defined
boxes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
approach will the Court take with respect to a particular kind of discrimination? How hard are they going to be on the government
initially? Some discriminations are
wrong and unjustified, while others are justified and permissible. But what is our initial presumption?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
choice of the level of scrutiny is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>predictor</i>
of whether the discrimination will be found to be proper.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>For
example, racial discrimination falls into the category of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>strict scrutiny</i>. Other forms
of discrimination don’t get that kind of presumption of hostility. For example, when the government discriminates
between optometrists, opticians, and ophthalmologists, it seems reasonable to
think there is a valid reason. Someone
attacking such a rule, though it is discriminatory, will face an initial
presumption against them. Each choice of
the level of scrutiny is an indicator of the judicial mindset as to the type of
discrimination at hand.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you’re in the zone of strict scrutiny, the discriminatory law must serve a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>compelling interest</i> and the law must be necessary. For example, in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, they have had a
long-standing practice of segregating prisoners on the basis of race for the
first 60 days until the prison officials determine how dangerous and violent
the prisoners are. This is a practice that
would usually demand strict scrutiny. However, there is a doctrine that says that discrimination in prison
will be treated differently and possibly considered with the rational basis test
instead of strict scrutiny. Maybe
segregating prisoners could be rationally related to the goal of preventing
prison violence. But on the other hand,
it may not be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>necessary</i>. Thus, the test chosen may be entirely
dispositive as to whether the practice violates the Equal Protection Clause or
not.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Notice
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>totally different </i>definition of
necessary here than in the Necessary and Proper Clause. “Necessary” is much more <span class=GramE>like</span>
“rational” in the Necessary and Proper Clause than here. In equal protection jurisprudence, necessary <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really means necessary</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
how does this play out in real life? <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Court doesn’t always follow its own
doctrine!</i> Consider <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Korematsu</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. United States</i>, where the Court
claimed that the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II demanded strict
scrutiny. In practice, the Court seemed
to only use the rational basis test.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the government defends a discriminatory classification in more than one way,
you must analyze <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>each interest</i> under
the appropriate level of scrutiny. Is
the classification appropriately related to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>each</i>
of the asserted interests? The government
wins if it can defend its classification under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>any</i> interest. The government
wins if it can assert an interest that meets the relevant test and show that
the law is sufficiently related to that interest. Thus, there is a kind of asymmetry here that
works in the government’s favor. What
about aggregation of interests? That’s a
tough question.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Also,
the government can be defeated one of two ways: either by showing that the
interest isn’t good enough, or the connection between the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>means</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ends</i> isn’t good
enough.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Under-inclusiveness versus
over-inclusiveness</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>Let’s
say the government wants to stop unsafe driving. People who are legally blind do not fit the
definition of safe drivers. If the government
only banned legally blind people from driving, that would be “woefully”
under-inclusive. If you want to go after
unsafe drivers, picking out blind drivers in particular is unfair. Why not go after drunk drivers? Why not go after speeding drivers?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>As
an example of over-inclusiveness, what if the government passed a law saying
that no one over the age of 80 can drive? This might be over-inclusive, because unsafe drivers only form some
proposition of older drivers. Not all
older drivers are unsafe! So targeting <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> old people and saying they can’t
drive just because you are concerned about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i>
of them who are unsafe <span class=GramE>represents</span> a case of
over-inclusiveness.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>You
can also have laws that are under- <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
over-inclusive <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at the same time</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>What
if the regulated category is “people driving over the speed limit”? You might get some <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>safe </i>drivers going over the speed limit (e.g. at 66 mph), plus you
might <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>miss</i> some <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>unsafe </i>drivers who are going <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>under</i>
the speed limit (e.g. swerving wildly between lanes at 45 mph or crawling at 5
mph in the middle of the highway).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
reality, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>most laws</i> are over-inclusive
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> under-inclusive to some
extent. The government will always regulate
with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some degree of imperfection</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
good is the fit between the group actually regulated and the group meant to be
regulated? If the fit is “pretty good”,
the law in question is more likely to be upheld. Foley thinks that <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Korematsu</i></span> is an example of a “loose
fit”. Strict scrutiny normally requires
an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extremely tight fit</i> to pass muster
under the Equal Protection Clause. In
that case, the group the government <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>wanted</i>
to regulate was “disloyal Americans”. Instead, the government <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actually</i>
regulated all Japanese-Americans. But
there were many people who were disloyal to the country in World War II, but <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>weren’t</i> Japanese-Americans. That particular law was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>somewhat</i> under-inclusive, but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hugely</i>
over-inclusive.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>“No
fit” is an extreme where there is no connection at all between the
categories. The purest way to understand
the rational basis test is that the case the government would lose would be in
this case of “no fit at all”. If there
was a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>total disconnect</i> between the
law the government adopts and the goal in adopting the <span class=GramE>law,
that</span> would be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>totally irrational</i>
and would fail the rational basis test.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Note
that virtually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all laws</i> will pass the
rational basis test because there is almost always <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>some overlap</i> between what the <span class=GramE>law</span> is doing
and what the law is trying to accomplish. But the Court isn’t always <span class=GramE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>complete</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> pure</i> with
respect to this test.</span></p>

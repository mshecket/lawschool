          had a law that said that bakers couldn�t work more than 10 hours a day
          or 60 hours a week. Why does that law present a constitutional
          question? The Supreme Court said that this law violated the Due
          Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But how does the
          regulation of the amount of hours that a bakery worker works raise an
          issue of due process? The question is whether the state is allowed to
          interfere with the freedom of contract. Who asserts the freedom of
          contract? It seems that the right was asserted by the owner of the
          bakery. The employer wants freedom of contract to hire his employees
          for more than 60 hours a week or more than 10 hours a day. Does the
          Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment say anything about the
          freedom of contract? No way!</span

        <span
          >How does <span class="SpellE">Lochner</span> assert, and how does the
          court accept, that this maximum hour law is a violation of the Due
          Process Clause when the claim is that it�s interfering with freedom of
          contract? The Fourteenth Amendment has a Privileges and Immunities
          Clause, but the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Slaughterhouse Cases</i> pretty
          much shoved this clause aside. There�s also the Due Process Clause, of
          course. The Court says that freedom of contract is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">kind of liberty</i>. They say

          of contract without due process of law?

          suggests�isn�t that due process? That�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">procedural</i> due process. But
          that may not be substantive due process. It�s like the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">process</i> itself is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">irrelevant</i>! We basically
          read it as: �No state shall deprive a person of liberty�period!� The
          notion is that you can�t take away certain liberties or certain
          people�s liberties. This is

        <span
          >There is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">separate doctrine</i> in
          Constitutional Law called �procedural due process�. That phrase would
          be redundant if it weren�t for �substantive due process�. Is this
          ridiculous? Why didn�t the Court just admit they were wrong and turn
          around and overrule their precedent?
          <span class="GramE"
            >There�s
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">stare decisis</i></span

          there such a sharp dichotomy between procedural and substantive due
          process? It may be hard to draw lines between substance and procedure!
          Smart lawyers, once the Privileges and Immunities Clause was taken
          away, did an end run around the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Slaughterhouse Cases</i> by
          coming up with substantive due process and using �rate-making
          proceedings� to attack the procedures first, and then the substance of
          the proceedings. They built up 30 years of precedent to get the Court
          comfortable enough to issue
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lochner</i></span
          >. But there was a lot of history that preceded
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lochner</i></span
          >. They had been doing a �fuzzy� version of substantive due process

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Speaking of the Due Process Clause, we have a separate clause in
          Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution which prohibits states from
          enacting laws that impairs the obligations of contracts (the
          �Contracts Clause�). Why didn�t the Court rely on this Clause to come
          to their conclusion in
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lochner</i></span
          >? It turns out that the actual Contracts Clause only applies to
          contracts that were previously entered into. (But, I wonder�how can we
          have bankruptcy laws?) In any case, that�s not what was going on in
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lochner</i></span
          >
          because the prohibition was
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">forward-looking</i>: you can�t
          enter into a bargain for 61 hours per week
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ever</i>. That�s why they
          couldn�t use this in

          made a public health argument: they argued that they needed to limit
          bakers� working hours to protect bread consumers from unhealthy bread.
          We want to look at every argument put forth by both sides! Parse out
          all the asserted reasons the government gives that the law should
          survive constitutional scrutiny. The second health reason was the
          health of the baker themselves. They put forth evidence to suggest
          that the dust from the flour causes lung disease and other ailments of
          the workers themselves. Why did the Court reject that argument? The
          Court said that in the case of mine workers, it makes sense that coal
          dust and other dangers constitute serious, pressing, and obvious
          safety concerns for the workers. In that case, the Court would let the
          government interfere with liberty of contract under a strict scrutiny
          analysis. But the Court finds a bakery too �run of the mill� to be
          interfered with. The Court finds that the </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State

        ><span>
          passed a law that capped the number of hours that a law firm could
          hire an associate for? People could disagree about whether that�s good
          policy. Should the Court get involved with this policy debate? Holmes
          argued that this is exactly what the Court was doing and that they
          shouldn�t get involved in the legislative process.</span

          is going to get repudiated in its entirety. So why do we still need to
          study it today? We need to look at the

          ><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          assert to justify the law? This is an early labor law. This is an era
          of industrialization and big corporations of the time had a lot of
          clout and power. Teddy Roosevelt came into office as a �trust-buster�.
          This was also an era of unionization among workers, especially in
          unskilled occupations. The state of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place

          said that working in a bakery is an industry with a disparity of
          bargaining power such that the employer has much more bargaining power
          than the employee. Thus, they argued, the freedom of bargaining power
          was somewhat illusory. They basically believed that Adam Smith didn�t
          apply to the modern industrial economy. So they attempted to justify
          the law as a labor law enhancing the economic bargaining power of the
          workers.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So the Court said that the first two purposes were plausible, but the
          means of pursuing them were not narrowly tailored enough. With respect
          to labor law, the Court said that it was not a legitimate purpose! The
          �labor law� goal of trying to level the playing field between
          employers and employees was called antithetical to the liberty of
          contract! The Court says that the labor law justification fails at the
          �goal� level. Holmes was famous for saying that labor laws are per se
          invalid and that the Constitution protects capitalism as such. Holmes
          though that the economic system was to be determined by the
          legislature. Holmes�s dissent was sort of on a more �philosophical�
          level.</span

          want to have your glasses fixed by putting old lenses in a new frame.
          You had to get a new prescription to put old lenses in a new frame.
          You had to go to the ophthalmologist or optometrist, not the optician.
          The optician could have done it just as well, though. This is an
          interference with the liberty of contract too! What was the claim
          under the Due Process Clause? Is this substantive due process or
          procedural due process? The optician isn�t complaining about a lack of
          notice, for example. They�re complaining that you shouldn�t be able to

            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lochner</i></span

          it then rejects in

          The Court has the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">opposite</i> judicial attitude,
          bending over backwards to sustain a much sillier-looking law than the

          law gets rejected even as a consumer health measure, this one should
          be rejected too because the consumer health and safety explanation is
          very slim. The Court uses the standard of being �rationally related to
          a legitimate purpose�. The judicial mindset is totally different with

          paychecks for workers! We want to constrain the supply of labor in

          Is the problem of excessive punitive damages a substantive problem or
          a procedural due process problem of poorly-instructed juries? That�s

          to say that Congress has no power to pass a law that outlaws birth
          control. Did they even have birth control in 1787? James Madison would

          Congress that they�re not allowed to do. Maybe marital privacy was

          >This is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">very, very, very, very</i>
          important point here. When James Madison sent the Bill of Rights to
          the states, he sent 12 provisions, only 10 of which were adopted. The
          First Amendment was actually number three on the list. Number two on
          James Madison�s list was adopted about 200 years later: the one about
          the compensation of congressmen. James Madison�s number one amendment
          was a provision that said no state shall interfere with the freedom of
          speech and some other rights among the Bill of Rights. The states said
          that the Federal Constitution shouldn�t tell states what they can and
          can�t do. They felt that those rights should be protected by the state
          constitutions. The structure of what got adopted in 1791 was a list of
          rights that Congress and the federal government can�t violate.
          Whatever else the Ninth Amendment <span class="GramE">means,</span> it
          only says that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Congress</i> can�t violate
          <span class="SpellE">unenumerated</span> rights. So where else can we
          look to force the states to not do stuff?</span

      <p>
        <span

          Ninth Amendment touch the states by its own force. But the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Fourteenth Amendment </i
          >incorporates the Bill of Rights! The Fourteenth Amendment was
          designed to constrain and subjugate states! The point is that the
          doctrine of substantive due process is used to take all the important
          rights of the Bill of Rights and funnel them into the Fourteenth
          Amendment to make them applicable against the states. Some of the
          rights of the Bill of Rights
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">are</i> procedural rights. But
          freedom of speech or freedom of religion are not procedural rights. So
          maybe �penumbra� parts of the Bill of Rights are incorporated through
          substantive due process too! But this is substantive due process! The
          only reason we can analyze this </span

          law against contraception is because of the substantive due process
          doctrine. There is no specific provision of the Constitution that
          applies. It�s a penumbra! There also was no �freedom of contract� in
          the Due Process Clause, but

          condoms, for example. They fill out a warrant saying that they have
          probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed, namely,
          the possession of contraceptives. So they get the warrant. Would the
          execution of that warrant be an unreasonable search and seizure in
          violation of the Fourth Amendment? Is the Court saying that this is a
          per se violation of the Fourth Amendment? They wouldn�t need to rely
          on the penumbra theory if the Fourth Amendment covered this situation.
          But the Fourth Amendment doesn�t apply. What if the married couple
          didn�t have birth control, but rather
          <span class="GramE">LSD.</span> They claimed that LSD improved their
          sex life. Does the

          we know whether LSD is in the �penumbra� along with condoms? Condoms
          are in the penumbra. What about Viagra? LSD doesn�t seem to be in the
          penumbra, though. This is what we must think about. Since the actual
          Constitution doesn�t tell us any of this, we need to reason it out to

<p><span>We’re
in 344 at </span><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="15"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
 '>3 PM</span></st1:time><span>. Foley will
stick around after the second session. What about the final exam? It
will be take-home. It hasn’t been
written yet. There’s not much to tell at
this point. It will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>likely</i> be a 24, 48, or 72 hour period. The start time of the Constitutional Law exam
could be as early as the moment that the Legislation exam is finished, or maybe
a little later. It will be completely
open books and open notes. We’ll turn in
a typed, word-processed product at the time that would have been the end time
of an in-class Constitutional Law exam. So instead of studying for a long time then cramming your knowledge into
3-4 hours, we’ll studying and write the exam at the same time. There will be word limits on all questions. It will be 100% essays based on fact
patterns.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Make
sure to staple each answer separately because they will be read
separately! Start each answer to a
question on a new page separately stapled. Foley emphasizes our reasoning and analysis as well as our writing
skills. We also won’t need to memorize
stuff as much. That’s much more like the
real world! Keep outlining, try to
understand the material, and try to phrase the constitutional question in each
case.</span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Stenberg v. <span
class=SpellE>Carhart</span></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
is this case important? This is a case
that could actually come up in practice. It’s also a hard case to read. It’s
the most recent abortion decision from the Supreme Court. This is a hot issue. There’s also a new statute that Congress has
enacted that purportedly bans “partial birth abortion”. Some see this as a direct challenge to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stenberg</i>. This statute is in trial in three different
districts, including </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Nebraska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Does Congress have the power to take a second
look at <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stenberg</i>? It’s likely that this current litigation will
work its way back to the Supreme Court. It’s sort of a <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marbury</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Madison</i> issue, too!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
why did the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Nebraska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law fail? It didn’t contain a health exception, but
only a life exception. Also, the Court
believed it might affect two different abortion procedures and not just
one. There’s D &amp; E and D &amp; X. D &amp; E is much more common. D &amp; X involves taking the fetus out and
then destroying it. D &amp; E basically
involves destroying it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>then</i> taking it
out.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Nebraska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law applied both pre- and post-viability. But you can’t ban all post-viability
abortions unless you have a life and health exception. To the extent that D &amp; X is necessary to
protect the health of the mother, it can’t be banned. To the extent that it’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not </i>necessary to protect the health of the mother, it <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> be constitutionally regulated or
banned.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Basically,
if <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anybody</i> thinks that D &amp; X is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ever</i> medically necessary, then you can’t
ban it. The dissent says that most
reputable doctors say that D &amp; X is never really necessary, and so states
should be able to outlaw it if they want, especially because D &amp; E is
another choice.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>O’Connor
sided with the liberals in this case. In
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Casey</i>, she upheld significant
provisions of the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law that the liberals
wanted out.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
do we make of all of this? How do we
know, under constitutional law, whether the majority or the dissent is
right? Is there an answer on the face of
the Constitution? No way! The Constitution is silent. What about the Court’s precedents? Kennedy and O’Connor <span class=GramE>part
company</span> and both claim that they are the “true follower” of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Casey</i>. Both O’Connor and Kennedy also claimed to be the true adherents to
Powell’s opinion in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bakke</i></span>. The two middle-of-the-road justices in the
current Court both claim the authority to be the moderate “voice of reason”
here. Is it possible for us as lawyers
to make a judgment on that debate in terms of which side is being more faithful
to the precedent? Does the precedent
provide an answer to the question, or is it sufficiently indeterminate so that both
sides can claim to be right?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
is the “undue burden” in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stenberg</i>? It’s an undue burden on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>reproductive rights</i>. One of
Scalia’s criticisms is the vague nature of the undue burden test. Some of the more liberal members don’t like
the undue burden test, but made the compromise to get the votes in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Casey</i>. They would prefer the strict scrutiny test.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:State><st1:place><b><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Washington</span></i></b></st1:place></st1:State><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span> v. <span class=SpellE>Glucksberg</span></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is an assisted suicide case. It’s
another sensitive, difficult issue. Here’s
a trick question: what does terminal sedation mean? If a patient is terminally ill and suffering
a lot of pain and needs painkillers, one medical practice is to give increasing
doses of painkillers to try to alleviate the pain. But if the pain is really, really bad and
there’s no other form of treatment, in order to give adequate pain medication
needed to relieve the pain actually causes the patient to go into a coma (to be
sedated). The only way to take the
patient out of the coma would be to withdraw the level of painkiller. That puts the doctor in a bind. Addressing pain means the patient must go
into a coma. What doctors will sometimes
do in those situations, if it’s according to the patient’s wishes, is that they’ll
administer the degree of pain killers necessary to avoid the pain and then
cause the coma. Since that’s
irreversible in the sense that the only way to reverse it would be to bring
back the pain, then the patient may authorize the doctor to withdraw life
support after the coma has been entered into. So it’s kind of a roundabout way to euthanasia. Is this the same or different from
physician-assisted suicide? How does
that factual question relate to the legal question of the right to
physician-assisted suicide and whether there’s no right to terminal
sedation? Can states outlaw terminal
sedation if they can outlaw physician-assisted suicide?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>With
terminal sedation, the patient dies of the original illness (or dehydration)
while in physician-assisted suicide death is caused by a drug overdose. Suicide is not considered acceptable, but
refusing treatment <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> considered
acceptable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It’s
hard to read this decision and figure out what the state of the law is in light
of this verdict. This is a 9-0
decision! But there are lots of different
concurrences. Rehnquist gets five votes,
but if you take O’Connor’s concurrence and add it to <span class=SpellE>Breyer’s</span>
separate concurrence and the other separate opinions, you’ll see that there are
five votes scattered about that go out of their way to address the pain killing
and terminal sedation idea. If you add
them up, they seem to say that they are sympathetic to the notion that there <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>would </i>be a constitutional right to receive
as much pain medication as you need to avoid pain even if the consequence is
that it causes sedation and thus the withdrawal of life support. However, they would only acknowledge that
this right exists for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>competent</i> patients.</span></p>

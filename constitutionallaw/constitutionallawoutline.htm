style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The Second Amendment</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does Congress have the power to ban machine guns?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It depends on how you interpret the Second
Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some say it applies to
individuals, while others say it only applies to militias.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just who takes these opposing points of
view?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are interest groups with
strongly held political views and they don’t all agree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley thinks there would be a way to read <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller</i> in a way that’s not so sweeping
as the way Chemerinsky wants to read it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The gun in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller</i> was a
sawed-off shotgun, not just any gun.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Court said that you have no right to own a gun that no real military could
own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s actually a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>partial</i> acceptance of the view that the
meaning of the Second Amendment is controlled by its militia function, but
Foley says it’s not as sweeping as Chemerinsky claims.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe another kind of weapon that does have a
military function could be the basis of an individual rights claim.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could claim that you have an individual
right to own a weapon that has a militia function.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One Circuit said that there’s no individual right to own a
machine gun, but Foley sees this as an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extension
</i>of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller </i>precedent, not
necessarily as following that precedent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As lawyers trying to find out the answer to the question of
whether the government has the power to ban machine guns, we look to judicial
precedent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Miller</i> is the most important precedent because it’s the most recent
case to come out of the United States Supreme Court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Assume for the basis of argument that the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller</i> precedent does not exist.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller</i>
case is old, and there has been an effort both inside and outside the judicial
system to overturn <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In fact, the current Department of Justice
has informed the United States Supreme Court that the current government
believes that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller</i> is wrong.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court has neither accepted nor
rejected this argument, but there is the sense that the Supreme Court might
someday revisit this issue as a case of “first impression” as if <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller</i> didn’t exist at all.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That would be a rejection of stare
decisis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s suppose this happens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
government in all its agencies is represented in litigation by the Solicitor
General, who works within the Department of Justice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a long history of the relationship
between the Supreme Court as the representative of the judicial branch and the
Solicitor General as the representative of the executive branch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By tradition, the Supreme Court has seen the
Solicitor General as a member of the Supreme Court bar and thus having a close
relationship with the United States Supreme Court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the relationship of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>law </i>to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>politics</i>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a big question we’ll need to
consider.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is figuring out what the law
is exclusively a political judgment, or is it independent of political
judgments?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if you think the judges
are purely or partly political, you can’t behave in court as if you think
so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You might have to tell your client
that, but you can’t say it in court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Being a good lawyer means being able to operate on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>different levels</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>planes</i> with respect to the same issue and take entirely different
perspectives on the same issue.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
is both an “internal” perspective and an “external” perspective.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we adopt the “internal” perspective, we <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>play the game</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We get into mode.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We use the language of the law and cite
precedent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We do legal reasoning that’s
independent of political judgment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
kind of “put on your lawyer hat”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “external” perspective is more of a critical appraisal
of the situation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You look at the legal
system from the outside and ask whether the judges are doing law or whether
they’re just doing politics.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the
perspective where you get cynical and ask “what’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>really</i> going on”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The machine gun case</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I have a strong subjective view of an issue, I can kind
of bend words around to make them mean what I want them to mean.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone is going to have a subjective
political view of these issues.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if
I’m a Supreme Court Justice and I can read the Second Amendment to support any
subjective view I want, is that how I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ought</i>
to carry on business as a Justice?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Begin with the stark contrast between <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>originalism </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nonoriginalism</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do these categories correlate with
objectivity/subjectivity or modern values/traditional values?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not necessarily.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even judges who reject original intent as a
guiding light would say that they’re not entitled to impose their own personal
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subjective</i> values on their
interpretation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whatever the judges
find, they must be objective, if only in a different way (looking at the will
of the people or the Constitution as a whole, for example).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The President, when deciding to sign or veto a law, can
legitimately say that because he was elected by the people he has been
empowered to exercise his own independent judgment of what is right or
wrong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the people don’t like the
President’s judgments, they can vote him out of office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A matter of

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we figure out the meaning of the Constitution,
then?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have these two completely
different ways of going about doing it, and it’s up to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>me</i> to make the choice of how to interpret it (original intent
versus contemporary values).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have an unclear document.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It would be a lot easier to deal with if we had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>clear directions</i> for dealing with it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we don’t have a clear method or rule to
follow in dealing with the document.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>radical</i> lack of
clarity!</p>

normal'>Lopez</i> is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>revolutionary
decision</i> in American jurisprudence!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Congress passed a statute (the “Gun-Free School Zones Act of
1990”) providing for federal criminal sanctions against people who went into a
“school zone” with a gun.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The defendant
was caught with a gun on school premises and was charged under the federal
law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The defendant challenged the
statute as unconstitutional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
particular, he argued that banning guns from schools wasn’t one of the powers
enumerated to the federal legislature in Article I of the Constitution.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district court didn’t buy the argument,
saying that the power of the statute was allowed under the Commerce Clause. The
defendant ultimately was convicted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
appealed his conviction to the Fifth Circuit, which overturned the conviction,
saying that the statute went beyond the bounds of the Commerce Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> appealed to the Supreme Court.<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>I</span>s Congress
given the power by the Constitution to regulate guns in schools under the
Commerce Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Constitution has
been interpreted by the Supreme Court such that Congress has three broad areas
of power under the Commerce Clause: (1) to “regulate the use of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>channels</i> of interstate commerce”, (2)
“to regulate and protect the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>instrumentalities</i>”
or “persons or things” in interstate commerce even if they only relate to
“intrastate activities”, and (3) to regulate activities “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>having a substantial relation</i> to interstate commerce”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The majority finds that if the Gun-Free School Zone statute
has a constitutional basis, it must be in the third area of power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the question is whether the statute
regulates activities that are related to interstate commerce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court sets down new precedent in
declaring that such activities must “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>substantially
affect</i>” interstate commerce and not just “affect” it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court finds that the statute has nothing to do with
commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is also no requirement
in the statute that the offense punished has some relationship to
commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if there was that
requirement, it would have to be proven in each case beyond a reasonable doubt
that there was sufficient connection between the offense and the regulation of
interstate commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court rejects the government’s argument that firearms in
schools are actually substantially related to interstate commerce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court reasons that if guns in schools are
related, then pretty much anything can be related, including stuff like
marriage, divorce, child custody, and “direct regulation of education”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court figures that the Framers couldn’t
have possibly meant for the Commerce Clause power to be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>this </i>broad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lopez was convicted of violating the Gun-Free School Zone
Act.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can’t carry a gun within 1000
feet of a school zone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This statute was
enacted by the U.S. Congress.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is it
significant that Congress passed this law versus, say, the <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>
legislature?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, what we’re concerned
about is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>congressional</i> power as
opposed to the power of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>state
legislatures</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How did the court get the Supreme Court?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Fifth Circuit vacated the conviction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no dispute about whether he had a
gun.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was caught red-handed and there
is no question whether he violated the law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The appeal was thus not on the basis of any reasonable doubt of fact or
anything like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do you know if you’re in a school zone under this
law?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A school zone is within 1,000 feet
of a school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is this important?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Someone’s violating the law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a person living in the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>,
would they know whether they were in violation of this law?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do people go around carrying tape measures
all the time?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there was no factual
dispute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lopez doesn’t claim he was
1,003 feet from the school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the basis for the appeal if there’s no factual
dispute?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only claim Lopez has on
appeal is that the law is unconstitutional because it’s beyond the scope of the
enumerated powers of Congress.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lopez
wins in the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court agrees to review the case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does the Supreme Court say after granting cert?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court decides that the law was
unconstitutional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court
says: “No, Congress, you lack this power.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>why?</i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does the phrase “piling inference on
inference” explain the holding of the case?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Possessing a gun <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in itself</i> is
not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directly</i> related to interstate
commerce. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But you could argue that
having a gun could cause violent crime which could cause increased insurance
rates and so on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The argument is in the
nature of A leads to B leads to C leads to D and D is related to interstate
commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s look at Article I, § 8 which is the big list of powers
of Congress.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a big list, but it’s a
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>finite</i> list.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don’t forget the last power, which is a
biggie: making laws that are “necessary and proper” to execute the listed
powers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Keep the “Necessary and Proper
Clause” in mind here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever there’s a challenge to a federal statute, the
government only has to show there’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one</i>
power to support the law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In order for
Lopez to prevail, he must show that Congress doesn’t have the power to pass
this law under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> of the enumerated
powers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a tough standard!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is important not only for questions of congressional
power, but also for any questions about who has what powers and who has the
burden of proof to show that something is within the power of a part of the
government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why doesn’t Lopez try to win this appeal on Second Amendment
grounds instead of Commerce Clause grounds?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Supreme Court hadn’t invalidated a statute on the basis of the

a heck of a long time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was this a

<p class=MsoNormal>Lopez has been around for almost a decade and people are
pretty comfortable with it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But when
Foley took this class 20 years ago, Foley learned from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

attempt to argue that something was out of the scope of the Commerce Clause was
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sure loser</i> under the Court’s
jurisprudence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, Congress
could pretty much do whatever it wanted and find some link to the Commerce
Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley’s professor turned out to
be completely wrong!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So keep in mind
that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the law can change!</i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress can’t just do whatever it wants
anymore.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If that was the accepted
wisdom, why the heck would Lopez’s lawyer have tried this appeal on Commerce
Clause grounds?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you don’t make the Second Amendment argument in trial
court you lose it on appeal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that
just means that the attorneys should have brought up both defenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By 1992, when Lopez gets caught red-handed, he’s got <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bad precedent</i> under the Second Amendment
(<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller</i> from 1939) because he’s not a
member of a militia and he gets caught with a gun near a school.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But moreover, most people in 1992 would say
he didn’t have a very good Commerce Clause argument <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Presumably Congress passed this law because they were
concerned about guns in schools.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breyer, in his dissent, says he will use three principles of
Commerce Clause interpretation to answer the question before the Court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) Congress may regulate local (intrastate)
activities so long as they “significantly affect” interstate commerce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) When determining whether an activity has
a “significant effect”, a court should consider the “cumulative effect of all
similar instances” of the activity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3)
Courts must judge the connection between an activity and interstate commerce
“at one remove”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, courts
should uphold actions of Congress for which there is a “rational basis” under
the Commerce Clause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breyer says the question boils down to Congress <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could have</i> had a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>rational basis</i> for finding a substantial connection between gun
related school violence and interstate commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Breyer’s</span> approach is to document
lots and lots of independent studies and congressional findings that indicate
that (1) the problem of guns in schools is serious and widespread, (2) guns in
schools have a “negative effect on classroom learning”, and (3) education has a
substantial impact on interstate commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breyer claims that holding this statute constitutional would
not expand the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause, but instead would
apply existing law to changing circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breyer claims that the majority’s approach has three legal
problems:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) The Court has upheld
statutes that have less of a relationship to interstate commerce than the one
under consideration.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) The Court makes
an improper distinction between commercial and non-commercial activities that
doesn’t adequately distinguish previous cases where the Court has upheld
statutes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In particular, the Court has
upheld civil rights statutes in cases where Breyer claims the conduct involved
was even less “commercial” than the conduct here.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) The Court will create upheaval in an area
of law that was previously well-settled: it will call into question the extent
of the power of Congress to enact all of the federal criminal statutes on the
books.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Breyer suggests that the
majority’s opinion offends <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stare decisis</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breyer does not see the “parade of <span class=SpellE>horribles</span>”
of the majority coming to pass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breyer asks: “How can we tell that having a gun near a
school is non-economic in nature?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lopez
didn’t make the gun.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He either had to
buy it, steal it or get it as a gift.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
he bought it, that’s economic.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If he
stole it, that’s kind of economic.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it
was given as a gift, someone else bought it, and that’s arguably economic.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do we draw the distinction?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What makes something economic?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about child-rearing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If growing wheat at home is economic, isn’t child-rearing economic
too?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It means the child care provider is
out of the labor force and also isn’t hiring a nanny or someone else to take
care of the kids.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breyer says it doesn’t matter whether a gun is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>economic in itself</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It doesn’t matter if wheat is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>economic in itself</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The issue is whether those guns near schools
have an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>economic effect</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Breyer believes that they do: guns near
schools leads to violence near schools.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That leads to bad schools and bad educational quality, which in turn
drains our economy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breyer believes that you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always
aggregate</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority believes you
only aggregate when you’re dealing with “something economic”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The majority cares about whether or not the local activity
that Congress is attempting to regulate is itself economic in nature or
not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority doesn’t explicitly
repudiate the aggregation principle with respect to non-economic activity, but
you can argue that they do this implicitly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There’s a lot going on here!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Even though we had relatively few pages to read, they are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very difficult</i> conceptually.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it’s our job to understand it!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don’t worry if you’re confused today.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Realize that there’s a lot going on here.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not transparent and we have to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really work</i> to figure out what’s really
going on here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc71448069"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The “rational basis” idea</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We looked at two questions that define the substantive test
as to how you know whether or not you have congressional power under the
Commerce Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The “substantial
effect” test is usually where the action is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In order to know whether there’s a “substantial effect”, you have to ask
whether the local activity in question is “economic” in nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But there’s a third question: Breyer says that all the past
precedents show that when the case comes to court, the issue isn’t simply “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is there an effect?</i>”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s the question for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Congress </i>to answer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Breyer
wants to claim that the court’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>own view</i>
on the substantial effect question doesn’t matter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court is only supposed to make sure that
Congress was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rational </i>or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i>, that is, that Congress had a
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rational basis</i> for finding a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>substantial effect</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Breyer thus claims that the court should be
making a somewhat different inquiry than the majority wants to make.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yesterday was great!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Foley likes when people come up after class to ask questions!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a lot going on here, and we can’t get
it all in within an hour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a formative period under Chief Justice Marshall,
who issued the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McCulloch v. Maryland </i>decision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a landmark decision that created a
framework for talking about congressional power as a whole.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, Marshall’s reasoning interpreted the
Constitution <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in general</i>, rather than
any particular <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>phrase</i> or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>section</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He didn’t look at the word “necessary” or the word “proper” and
determine what those words mean.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Instead, he looked at the Constitution <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>in general</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why do we have a
Constitution?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What function does the
Constitution have?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These questions gave
him the guidelines for his understanding of, in particular, the Necessary and
Proper Clause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He had a choice: he could have interpreted the Necessary and
Proper Clause much more narrowly and restrictively and found that the creation
of the Bank of the United States was outside of Congress’s power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He didn’t choose the narrow path, he chose
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>broad</i> path.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case is important today because we must
be aware that the concept of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general
reasoning</i> is available to the Court, if it so chooses, as a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>methodology</i> to think about constitutional
problems when they arise for the first time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court doesn’t always take this approach, though.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court will sometimes take a more
“word-specific” approach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marshall also issued the first opinion that interpreted the
Commerce Clause: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gibbons v. Ogden</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here are four key decisions that set the stage prior to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Schecter</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Poultry</i> – This case was decided in
1935.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s the “sick chicken” case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case occurred at the time of the New
Deal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The country is in the midst of the
Depression.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The unemployment rate is
25%.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress and President Roosevelt
are trying to deal with what they see as an unprecedented economic calamity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress passes a lot of New Deal
legislation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One key piece of legislation was the National Industrial
Recovery Act, which regulated the wages and hours of workers in many different
industries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Supreme Court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unanimously</i>
held that regulating the wages and hours of workers in a factory in Brooklyn is
beyond Congress’s commerce power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
new law was invalidated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme
Court ruled that even though the chickens moved in the stream of commerce, the
workers only worked in <st1:place>Brooklyn</st1:place> and thus their wages and
hours were a matter solely for the state of <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
to deal with.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that this law applied
to every slaughterhouse everywhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why did the people in Philadelphia in 1787 scrap the
Articles of Confederation and give the U.S. Congress more power with this
Commerce Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Compare this to NAFTA
or the current Summit of the Americas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Prior to the adoption of the Commerce Clause, the states of the United
States were engaged in protectionist measures against each other.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Commerce Clause, at least in one view,
was originally a free trade measure among the states.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was meant to fight “economic
Balkanization”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In contemporary terms,
we can compare this to the European Union.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The framers of the Constitution wanted to create a
free-trade agreement between the original thirteen states.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s all the Commerce Clause was originally
designed to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now fast forward to 1935.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you were to ask James Madison, who came up with the Commerce Clause,
about a shop in Brooklyn, he would say “that’s not what we meant!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He would say that they were only concerned
with free trade between New York and, say, New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, the Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate
foreign trade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The point is that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nothing</i>
that we talk about today would make <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any
sense</i> to the framers of the Constitution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>“Congress has the power to regulate WHAT??!!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They wouldn’t even be able to understand our
conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s going to be difficult to think about is when we get
to the point where we can start having a conversation like we did yesterday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>James Madison did not believe that Congress had the power to
create a national bank.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had a much
narrower understanding of the Commerce Clause than we do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, he had a narrower understanding than
Marshall did in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McCulloch</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our sense of the Constitution is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>radically different</i> from the conception of the people who originally
wrote the document.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Carter Coal</i> – This
case is one year later.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’re still in
the Depression.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress and Roosevelt
adopt a new law that regulates the coal industry <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>in particular</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They believe
that coal is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>particularly</i> important
to the national economy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s important
for running the railroads and making steel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Congress says: “We won’t do poultry, but let’s do coal.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They plan to regulate the wages and hours of coal workers
because that affects the price of coal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
by a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court says that Congress can’t do that!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They reason that a coal mine is not <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>interstate</i> in nature because each mine
is located in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only one state</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, the wages that a mine worker gets
for working in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that particular mine</i>
is a local issue of the state where the mine is located.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each state controls the conditions within the
mines within that state.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court
believes that it matters neither that the coal will enter the stream of
interstate commerce, nor that Carter Coal does business in many different
states.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The subsequent entry of the coal
into interstate commerce doesn’t matter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But notice that now we’re starting to get a split.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Jones &amp; Laughlin </i>–
This case comes up in 1937.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case
involves the National Labor Relations Board.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Congress comes up with a new law to govern working conditions: hours,
wages, and so on in many different industries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The statute looks a lot like the NIRA above, but the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>case</i> looks more like <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Carter Coal</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The issue is: Can Congress regulate the rules of the
employees of this company when they work in the mines or in particular
factories?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you considered <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Schecter</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Poultry </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Carter Coal</i> as precedent, you might think the conclusion is obvious
and the law can’t stand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But in a reversal, the Supreme Court by a 5-4 margin allows
the law to stand <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as applied</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court argued that steel is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>essential</i> to the health of the national
economy, and thus steel worker strikes would cripple interstate commerce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exactly
the reverse </i>of the reasoning in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Carter
Coal</i>, that is, it’s the reasoning of the dissenter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The same argument from the dissent in the
previous case becomes the prevailing argument in this case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why does the transformation happen here?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Roosevelt was going to pack the court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But note that there are no changes in
appointments to the court between 1935 and 1937.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The exact same nine individuals who decided <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Schecter</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Poultry</i> unanimously and then decided <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Carter Coal</i> decided <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Jones &amp; Laughlin</i> entirely differently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roosevelt and Congress are losing cases.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He won’t accept what the Supreme Court
says.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also note that 1936 is an election
year.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Roosevelt runs a campaign
essentially against the “old farts” on the Supreme Court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He claims they’re totally out of touch with
reality and that it’s really their fault that the Depression hasn’t
abated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a pure political power
move (I think).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roosevelt announced after a landslide victory that he’s
going to pack the Court (that’s not what he called it, of course).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was going to destroy the Supreme Court as
an institutional of American government as it had heretofore existed because it
was getting in the way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The President
was going to more or less sweep the Supreme Court into the “dustbin of history”
because they were getting in the way!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Supreme Court justices read the newspaper and they pay
attention to what’s going on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
realize that they can’t win this fight!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They act to save their institution!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><span class=SpellE>Ain’t</span> this exciting?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Justice Roberts switched sides!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems like what he did was switched his
vote to save the institution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
worked!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was enough to shut
Roosevelt up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Senate stopped holding
hearings on the court-packing plan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>“This is power politics!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
reality!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was a huge transformation in the understanding of the
Commerce Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It didn’t happen by way
of a constitutional amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Roosevelt
considered this but rejected it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Roosevelt felt that the only way you could trust the Court was by
packing the court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, a whole new way
of understanding the Commerce Clause emerged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wickard</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. <span class=SpellE>Filburn</span></i> –
We have some more appointments, but we have more or less the consolidation of <st1:place>Roosevelt</st1:place>’s
power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The ethos is: Congress can do
pretty much whatever it wants in the name of protecting the economy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is instructive to compare <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Schecter</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Poultry</i> and <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wickard</i></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tomatoes or wheat being grown at home are
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agricultural</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>local</i> in the way that chickens are also <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>agricultural </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>local</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Seven years after <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Schecter</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> Poultry</i>, they go from saying “no you can’t regulate it” to “yes
you can”!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These cases are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not
consistent </i>doctrinally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
represent two <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>radically different ways</i>
of understanding the Commerce Clause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now fast-forward to right before <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Lopez</i>: between <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Wickard</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>in 1942
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> in 1995, the prevailing
ethos is that Congress can do whatever it wanted in an era of believing in Big
Government and the power of the federal government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>President Johnson talked about the Great Society.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the critical aspects of the Great
Society was the Civil Rights Act and the idea that Congress would have the
authority to protect civil rights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Act was justified under the Commerce Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Think of Ollie’s Barbeque, a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really
local </i>restaurant in Alabama.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Congress says there can’t be any discrimination there because
restaurants are a form of commercial activity that receives its products
through the stream of interstate commerce!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>By the 1960’s, Congress can do that because there’s a whole change in
the understanding of the Commerce Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We will give Congress broad latitude to do what they think is in the
national interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This changes dramatically when we get to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next week, we have three classes, and each class we’ll be reading
a different Court of Appeals case out of the Ninth Circuit that grapple with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Morrison</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’ll see the same
question of the scope of the Commerce Clause not from the perspective from the
U.S. Supreme Court that’s making the decisions and creating the relevant law,
but from the position of subsidiary judges in the legal system who themselves
are trying to figure out what <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i> mean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may see the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>doctrine
of avoidance</i> in this class and in Legislation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Courts like to avoid constitutional questions

<p class=MsoNormal>Did Congress have constitutional authority to enact § 13981
under the Commerce Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress has
the power to regulate <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>economic </i>activities
that are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>substantially related</i> to
interstate commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court says that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez
</i>supplies the proper framework to analyze whether the statute in question is
within the proper reach of Congress’s Commerce Clause power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, the Court claims that the non-economic nature of the
conduct in question in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> was
important to the decision to find the statute unconstitutional.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next, the Court says that a statute is more
likely to pass muster if the conduct prohibited is explicitly limited to that
which “substantially affects interstate commerce”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court notes that the statute in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> lacked specific congressional
findings supporting the connection between the statute and interstate
commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally, the Court notes the
“attenuated” nature of the connection between gun possession and interstate commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Applying this rubric to the Violence Against Women Act, the
Court finds that if this act can stand, Congress would pretty much be allowed
to regulate anything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It doesn’t
apparently help that the legislative record includes extensive findings relating
violence against women and interstate commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breyer says<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>the
economic/non-economic distinction is too difficult to make and doesn’t get
applied consistently anyway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Breyer also
thinks the economic/non-economic question should focus on the “effects” and not
the “causes”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dissent says that the mountain of facts gathered by
Congress in support of the connection between violence against women and
interstate commerce distinguishes this case from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Lopez</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are the facts?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A
woman had been raped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She sued the
perpetrators under the federal Violence Against Women Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does the case get to the Supreme Court?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would this case look any different to the
U.S. Supreme Court if the plaintiff had decided not to name the university as a
defendant?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, but why not?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not necessary for there to be multiple
defendants for the constitutional question to exist.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The university is irrelevant, in a sense, to
the federal litigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems like the Court is trying to show some sympathy to
the plaintiff even as they dismissed her complaint.<span

this <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is not</i> a criminal case.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The constitutional
question of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Does Congress have the

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chemerinsky thinks <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i>
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>even more revolutionary</i> and a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bigger deal</i> than <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

class=SpellE>Souter</span> thinks too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Basically, this is the deal: in the VAWA, Congress actually thought long
and hard about the Commerce Clause question itself and wrote lots of
findings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress explained in great
detail what it saw as the link between gender-motivated violence and its effect
on interstate commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example,
when women get hurt, they can’t go to work and absenteeism has an effect on
productivity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They document the economic
dimension of gender-motivated violence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is different than the Gun-Free School Zones Act.<span

fashion!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress was complacent with
the broad powers that had been granted to them by the Supreme Court under the
Commerce Clause since 1937.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some observers thought <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>
would be a narrow decision that would simply require the procedural requirement
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>findings</i> supporting a connection

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Foley’s take</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The majority in both <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i> are asking and answering
a different question than Breyer asks and wants to answer in the dissents.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Breyer says in both these cases you can’t
dispute the fact that the activity in front of the Court, if taken in the
aggregate, has an effect on the economy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But the majority doesn’t disagree!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They don’t say Breyer is wrong to say that you can make that connection
as a factual matter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They just say that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>even though</i> you can make that connection
factually, it won’t be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>legally
dispositive </i>connection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s the same thing in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority doesn’t dispute the findings of
fact provided by Congress: domestic violence could have a huge impact on our
national economy as well as being a social and moral problem.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that’s not going to be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dispositive</i> as far as the constitutional
question of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley thinks that from the framework of the majority, once
it decides <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> and once it gets
over the hurdle that the existence of findings or their absence isn’t a big
deal, then <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i> follows quickly
from the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> precedent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The majority says in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez
</i>that no matter how bad it is to have guns near schools, it’s a local
problem that state law must regulate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But if “guns near schools” isn’t a power Congress can address, then rape
isn’t going to be a power of Congress either.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It will have to be an issue of state criminal or tort law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s non-economic.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The framers of the Constitution saw these as
state issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we know the scope of what the Court is deciding?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of people wrote amicus briefs for this case and a lot
of people thought Justice O’Connor would be sympathetic to gender violence concerns
and would be willing to uphold this law even though she wasn’t willing to
uphold the gun law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It didn’t work
because in her understanding this was just the same issue as the gun issue.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She wasn’t going to expand federal
jurisdiction in either situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i> say: if we allow federal law to
enter these domains, then we destroy the notion of a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>dual system</i> of government.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If we allow the federal government to do <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>this</i>, then we can allow the federal government to do <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anything</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the same motivation behind the
majority opinion in both cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we left off, we were talking about how in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i>, many folks were organized in a
concerted way to try to win O’Connor’s “swing vote” on the theory that since
the issue involved gender violence she would be more personally involved than
she might have been in terms of gun violence in schools.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were tons of amicus briefs, including
the states themselves, arguing that Congress should have the power to regulate
violence against women.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One more point: for O’Connor as well as the other justices
in the majority, it boiled down to the fact that the counsel for the U.S.
government could not answer a particular question.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was a great oral arguer, Seth
Waxman.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The question was: “If we uphold
this statute, this Violence Against Women Act, is there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>any</i> limitations on Congress’s commerce power?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, if we uphold this statute,
can we imagine some other statute that would be beyond Congress’s Commerce
Clause power, or would upholding this statute grant unlimited power?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>O’Connor tried to get Waxman to come up with
a statute that would be unconstitutional, but he couldn’t!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There’s a debate in both cases between Rehnquist in the
majority and Breyer in the minority on this exact issue.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rehnquist says there must be a statute that
falls outside of Congress’s power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we
can’t find a theoretical example that goes farther than the statute at hand,
then <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>this statute</i> must go too far.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley finds the transcripts of oral argument before the U.S.
Supreme Court very enlightening.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
you’re confused about what’s really going on in a case, read the transcripts of
oral argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s where “the rubber
meets the road”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The critical questions
that the justices are thinking about come to the fore.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you want to know what the justices are
thinking about and what’s going to be on their minds, read the oral argument in
similar cases.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a great way to
prepare for your own case before the Supreme Court (keep your fingers crossed).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley will try to raise questions in class that are like the
ones that the Justices would raise at oral argument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is the section of the statute that forbids possession of
child pornography “made with materials transported in interstate commerce”
constitutional under the Commerce Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>To determine whether a statute is constitutional under the Commerce
Clause, the four-part test of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i>
must be applied: (1) Is the prohibited activity of a commercial or economic
nature?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) Is the connection between
the prohibited activity and interstate commerce too attenuated to allow the
exercise of the Commerce Clause power?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(3) Does the statute contain an “express jurisdictional element”
intended to satisfy Commerce Clause requirements?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(4) Do congressional findings exist to
support a connection between the prohibited conduct and interstate commerce?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The majority notes that its decision does not affect the ability
of the state of <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State> to
punish McCoy under state law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The majority starts by finding that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Morrison</i> controls in the current case and sets out a four-part test
to find out whether the Commerce Clause power was exceeded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following the first factor, the majority finds the fact that
McCoy’s behavior was non-commercial and non-economic to be especially important
to their conclusion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court
distinguishes this case from <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Wickard</i></span>, saying basically that since McCoy was not a
customer in the interstate child pornography business, the photograph she was
responsible for would not affect that business in any way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The court finds that there is not a highly attenuated
relationship between McCoy’s behavior and interstate commerce, but rather no
relationship whatsoever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The court notes that the statute in question does contain an
express jurisdictional element, but the court says that this is not
dispositive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This goes against what some
other Circuits have claimed in decisions pre-dating <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Morrison</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, the court finds that the legislative history does
not support the constitutional application of the statute to non-commercial
activities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court notes that the
congressional findings mention “multimillion dollar [child pornography] <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>industries</i>”, suggesting that the statute
is mostly intended to combat child pornography in terms of commercial
activity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court also finds that the
legislative history contains previously expressed concerns over the constitutionality
of the statute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dissent argues against the technique of narrowly
construing the statute to make a particular section unconstitutional while
apparently leaving the remainder unaffected.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Instead, the dissent says that the court needs to either find the
statute constitutional on its face or unconstitutional on its face.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moreover, the dissent would give more
deference to Congress in their implicit finding that purely non-commercial,
intrastate possession of child pornography substantially affects interstate
commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dissent says this a
political question and not a legal question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

California.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What was it that moved in
interstate commerce?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was the camera
and the film that was used to take the picture came from either New York or
abroad.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute requires that the
material either move in interstate commerce (which didn’t occur) or else was
produced using materials from interstate commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McCoy possessed one “other matter” as described in the
statute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She’s indicted under the
statute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What happens to her?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She conditionally pleads guilty.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>But McCoy pleads guilty but reserves the right to appeal the
dismissal of her motion to dismiss the indictment.<span

conditional?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does she dispute that she

<p class=MsoNormal>She says that she’s guilty, but she’s preserving an issue
for appeal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She says that she did violate

<p class=MsoNormal>How would we define the Commerce Clause question in this
case?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First off, we’re <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>probably </i>in the realm of the
“substantial effects” test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But note
that this case is different from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This statute has a “jurisdictional hook”, and

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the constitutional question about Congress’s

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Does Congress have the power under the
Commerce Clause to criminalize possession of a picture that (1) is sexually

home?</i><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whoa!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s specific!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dissent and the majority dispute the use of the
aggregation theory of <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wickard</i></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t even really agree on what question
they’re answering!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They have different
conceptions of the facts and the statute and the relationship between the two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the difference between the question the majority
thinks they’re addressing and the question the dissent thinks they’re
addressing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dissent is saying:
“We’re going to ask whether Congress has the power to criminalize possession of
child pornography whatever the particular circumstances are.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, it may be a person who has one
picture or 20,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It could be someone
who intends to sell the pictures across state lines or not.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the dissent doesn’t want to subdivide
this up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dissent wants to ask
whether Congress has the power to regulate the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>whole category</i> as one big category.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The majority says, on the other hand, that you must ask
whether Congress has power over certain <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subcategories</i>
of these pictures, and not the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>whole category</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How does the majority define the relevant
subcategory?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How narrow do they get?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notice that this Ninth Circuit opinion discusses an opinion
out of the Fifth Circuit called <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Kallestad</i></span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The facts
of that case were very different.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
defendant advertised in a local newspaper for women to come to his house to be
models.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He photographed underage women
who he wasn’t related to.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The allegation
was that he treated the product of those photography sessions as the functional
equivalent of pornographic pictures that he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>might</i>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>have purchased</i> in interstate
commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It just so happens that he
produced them himself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can clearly
compare this argument to <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wickard</i></span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The majority thinks that any possession of a picture for home
use that’s not going to be sold in the channels of interstate commerce is the
issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley thinks you could narrow it
to the family context, where a parent is taking a picture of a child.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you want to subdivide the category the way
the majority wants to, you can do so in different ways.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The way you subdivide it will be relevant for
how you define the constitutional question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why is this getting prosecuted?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dissent doesn’t think it’s so terribly
serious that he would have prosecuted her if it was up to him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that’s not the judge’s job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are the essential elements of the majority’s reasoning
for their conclusion that this is beyond Congress’s power?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have a four-part test under <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is it commercial?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
court says no.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, McCoy
had to go to the film lab, and she had to buy the camera through interstate
commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Isn’t child pornography
commercial in nature, or at least a lot of it?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><span class=SpellE>Filburn</span> didn’t intend to sell his wheat.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is that commercial but this photo isn’t?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is the connection to interstate commerce attenuated?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court finds that it’s clear that she’s
not in the business of producing child pornography.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the wheat in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wickard</i></span> wasn’t going to be moved
into the stream of interstate commerce either.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why is that wheat <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>commercial</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>connected to interstate commerce</i>?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the majority opinion, the critical distinction is that
wheat is a fungible good while child pornography is not.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The point is that the mother doesn’t possess
the picture as a substitute for other child pornography.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This possession at home of this picture does
not relate to the interstate child pornography market at all.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the critical distinction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We’ll spend a little time tomorrow on the “jurisdictional
hook” question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why can’t the government

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why isn’t the existence of a jurisdictional hook in the
statute in question dispositive here?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The argument might be made (according to Foley) that the
presence of the jurisdictional element makes the discussion in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Morrison</i> irrelevant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
Congress wants here is to regulate the camera and film in interstate
commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress wants to regulate the
camera and film such that they’re not used to make child pornography.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s clear that Congress can regulate the
camera and film in a lot of other ways if these items are going to move in
interstate commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So why can’t the
government also say that we don’t want these items doing something
obnoxious?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Couldn’t the government say
that you can take whatever pictures you want, but just not with something
that’s moved in interstate commerce?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The U.S. Supreme Court hasn’t taken this case, but what
might they do if they did?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the
strongest argument for McCoy in claiming that there is no Commerce Clause power
to forbid her conduct?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Side question: how long does it take from the time an
appeals court decision is handed down to know that the Supreme Court is going
to review it?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isn’t the production of the picture tied to interstate
commerce in a way that the conduct in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i> was not?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Think of O’Connor’s question to Seth Waxman: “Show me a
statute that flunks the Commerce Clause if this one is okay.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In order to uphold this law as applied to
these facts, would I, as a Supreme Court Justice, have to say that the Commerce
Clause power is completely unlimited?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley says we genuinely have no idea how the U.S. Supreme
Court would decide this case, and if we think we do, that’s probably a danger
sign.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All we have right now is the
guidance of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What Foley thinks will motivate O’Connor or Kennedy would be
something along the following lines: How important is it that we allow Congress
to have this power? <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Is this something we
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>should</i> let Congress do?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, how important is it that
we <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deny</i> Congress this power in order
to preserve some state autonomy in our “dual system”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What cuts <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in
favor</i> of having Congress and the federal government win power in this case
is that the Supreme Court has already noted a stopping point.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The very existence of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Lopez </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i> show
that there is a limit, and therefore the Supreme Court can allow Congress to
deal with a national problem without worrying about their power going too far.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the reasons that this case is important is that the
picture is not fungible with other pictures the way wheat is fungible.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Foley claims this is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>commodity </i>case instead of an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>activity</i> case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the Supreme Court might find that Congress
can have authority to regulate this <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>commodity</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another argument that could be made on behalf of McCoy is
the “traditional state domain” argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court talks about education, family law, and family relations as
areas that we traditionally look to state law to decide.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When Congress writes a new law in that area,
we have the danger of having Congress usurping that authority.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We let Congress rule when they’re in their
domain, but we should not expand Congress’s power into areas that especially
intrude on state sovereignty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McCoy</i>
involves a parent-child relationship, it helps to make the argument that the
issue belongs to state law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If McCoy has
been a bad parent, maybe California law should tell us what should be done with
her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe we don’t want Congress to set
up a nationwide standard for what it means to be a good parent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don’t want the states deprived of their
ability to administer family law differently in each state.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We like having each state go its own way on
cultural issues and social values and mores.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is how Foley would set out the argument in order to make it
attractive to O’Connor or Kennedy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The key idea is that the argument is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>functional</i> argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
could try to measure “substantial effects”, but ultimately, the justices are in
the driver’s seat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What will move them
is not a formalistic and technical argument, but an argument about <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>function</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>purpose</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The justices,
according to Foley, want to hear a reason <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>why</i>
we should give Congress the power we give them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This series of assignments all relate to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>federalism</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we’re going to switch gears on Monday and
Tuesday to looking at the Tenth Amendment as a limit on federal power and
protection of state power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we read the Tenth Amendment cases, we should start by
thinking about what the relationship is between the Commerce Clause and the
Tenth Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Chemerinsky discusses
this, and we’ll also discuss this in class.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(What powers are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>given</i> to
Congress by the Commerce Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
powers are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>taken away</i> from Congress
by the Tenth Amendment?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now that we’ve read a few of these cases, Foley wants to
know if we’re starting to get more comfortable with what’s going on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There’s a conflict between “facial” challenges and
“as-applied” challenges that comes up in each case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The normal rule is that you start with an
“as-applied” challenge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means that
there a particular person in court who says: “This law is unconstitutional <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as applied to me</i>.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It could be a civil or criminal defendant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other hand, in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Raich</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

anticipation</i> of having a law used against you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re the petitioner or defendant, you
may not care about how the law is applied to anybody else except yourself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You’re not normally allowed to go to court and say: “The law
can be validly applied to me, but it can’t be applied validly from someone else
who is different than me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, I
want the Court to declare the law unconstitutional on the whole so I win even
though I couldn’t have won on a claim as applied just to me.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can’t piggyback on someone else’s
constitutional rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>facial
challenge</i> in its most basic form.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What about third-party standing?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a complicated body of law called
“standing law”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It comes up a lot in
practice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It means that in a narrow set
of circumstances when your constitutional rights aren’t at stake you can
litigate on behalf of someone else’s constitutional rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the sake of example, the First Amendment freedom of
speech principle is one area where facial challenges and third-party standing
are allowed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is allowed because we
want a very robust protection of freedom of speech.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In pornography cases, for example, the court
will often say with respect to non-protected extra gross pornography that the
“smut peddler” can bring a facial challenge based on the notion that the law in
question is written so broadly that it bans materials that shouldn’t be banned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this is the exception rather than the rule.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This distinction really confuses judges,
courts, and lawyers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’re not sure
when they have a facial challenge in front of them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Judges have a hard time with this!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we’re confused, that’s okay, because they
are too!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Part of the reason is that the
idea of “facial versus as-applied challenges” isn’t in the Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley thinks the challenge in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

challenges.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley says that <i

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley says: The Ninth Circuit has a poor reputation in the

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does the Tenth Amendment forbid the federal government from
regulating the activities of state Departments of Motor Vehicles?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Tenth Amendment says that the federal
government cannot force the states to enact policies or regulations that would
impact the state’s citizens.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress
can, however, regulate the activities of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the
states themselves</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court first assumes that the statute is constitutional
unless proven otherwise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the Court
accepts the federal government’s argument that the DPPA is a constitutional
exercise of Congress’s Commerce Clause power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court then finds that the statute does not violate the
Tenth Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court accepts that
following the rules of the DPPA will require time and effort, but finds that
this is not dispositive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are many
other federal regulations that require time and effort for compliance which are
constitutional under the Tenth Amendment</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this case, the Court started off its analysis with
Commerce Clause, finding that there was no Commerce Clause problem.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why was this law a valid exercise of the
Commerce Clause power?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What federal law
is being challenged?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s the DPPA.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does the law do?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It restricts the state’s ability to sell
personal information about drivers to businesses and other individuals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <span class=SpellE>DMVs</span> of each
state collect personal information from all drivers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They used to turn around and sell that
information to telemarketers and other unsavory people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But how is this connected to interstate commerce?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, Ohio might sell its driver
license information to a telemarketer in Wyoming.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or they could sell their list to a company in
Ohio that also does business in another state.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So the driver license information, though it starts out locally, it
becomes a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>thing</i> in interstate
commerce once it gets sold, and thus it is subject to regulation by Congress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We spent a lot of time on the “substantial effects” test and
<span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wickard</i></span> and
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Morrison</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why didn’t they go
through an elaborate test like the ones we saw earlier?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court’s impression is that this isn’t <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intrastate</i> stuff.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The information is a good that can and does
travel between states.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So there’s no
need to get to the “substantial effects” inquiry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Commerce Clause cases, the Court talked about three
different things Congress can regulate: “channels” and “instrumentalities” of
interstate commerce and things that are intrastate but have a “substantial effect”
on interstate commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So how does the
information being sold in this case fit into that rubric?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court thinks of this as a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>direct</i> regulation on interstate
commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did this statute have a Commerce Clause hook?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not exactly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It also seems like the federal government doesn’t discriminate between
information that never leaves the state and the information that goes into
interstate commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recall the “Child Labor Case”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The law in question was challenged on the
basis of the Tenth Amendment, and the Supreme Court invalidated the law at the
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Later, this decision was
overruled.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now we believe that Congress
can regulate goods that crossed state lines, even if the reason they are being
regulated is purely intrastate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley thinks that the Court didn’t intend to make a big deal
about the Commerce Clause in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Condon</i>,
but it gives us a clue about what the Court will uphold on Commerce Clause
grounds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So don’t miss the Commerce
Clause significance of this case!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don’t
take received wisdom!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Emanuel put <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Reno v. Condon</i> in the Commerce Clause
section, actually.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court more or less decided: “Hey!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to give Congress this power, and we
think it’s of the kind that Congress should address!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We think they should do so because it’s truly
an interstate problem, unlike guns and rape.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court sends a message from all nine justices: This is a power we’ll
give to Congress.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But why did Justice
Thomas agree?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hmmm…maybe it had
something to do with the fact that privacy rights are at stake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Would it be permissible for Congress to say: “States must
destroy DMV records after ten years”?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Congress mustn’t provide overly detailed regulation of state
agencies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>States are supposed to be
autonomous entities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One thing that helped this law be constitutional was the
fact that it applied both to states and private individuals (though in
actuality, these bits were in different parts of the statute).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the law was directly <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>exclusively</i> at state governments, it might be more likely to
violate the Tenth Amendment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Congress must not force state governments to adopt
particular laws or regulations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress
can’t order states around with respect to their <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>sovereign capacity</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Lawmaking is one such sovereign capacity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But what’s the connection between Commerce Clause analysis
and Tenth Amendment analysis?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What if Congress required Ohio to move its capital to
Cincinnati?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could we argue that this is
permissible under the Commerce Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What about under the Tenth Amendment?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you moved the capital to Cincinnati, you might get more
interstate commerce between Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could argue that the placement of a
state’s capital has an effect on potential or actual interstate commerce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So we may well conclude that this would be
within Congress’s Commerce Clause power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But such an action would violate a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>core attribute</i> of state sovereignty.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s how the justices think about the Tenth
Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They say that 13 free and
independent states fought the revolution separately, and then agreed to an
alliance such that they gave up <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i>
of their sovereignty, but not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The thing to think about the Tenth Amendment is that it’s a
question about protecting <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rights</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Tenth Amendment does not <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>confer power</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Commerce Clause confers power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Commerce Clause <span class=SpellE>giveth</span>,
and the Tenth Amendment <span class=SpellE>taketh</span> away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Tenth Amendment guarantees <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>states’ rights</i> just like many of the
other amendments protect individual rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Reno v. Condon</i>
says it makes a difference whether Congress tells states they <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must</i> do something, as opposed to telling
the states that they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can’t</i> do
something.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Step back and think about
this from a common-sense standpoint: This Supreme Court would never allow the
federal government to interfere with a state’s choice of where to place its
capital within its borders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The value of
preserving the “dignity” of the state of Ohio as a sovereign state would be
intruded upon too far no matter <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>how </i>it’s
done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Con Law, doctrine works <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>in service of</i> fundamental values, not the other way around.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court is motivated by the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>underlying reasons</i> that we have these
constitutional principles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the Court
sees that it has created a doctrinal rule that says there is a big difference
between affirmative mandates and negative prohibitions, and they find that this
isn’t compatible with some basic idea like state sovereignty, then they’ll
change the doctrine to get to where they want to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A number of people are trying to articulate the rule or
principle that results from the Tenth Amendment cases.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the test?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>,
we had a test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here, the test isn’t
jumping out at us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the
difficulties is whether we can even articulate the test the Court is using to
evaluate Tenth Amendment questions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
should try to come up with a couple of candidates for what the current test is
for Tenth Amendment questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Active reading in law is important!<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is one of the reasons that the Tenth Amendment is so
difficult.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court has been really
inconsistent over time, even in recent years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The current view of the Tenth Amendment is that it’s an <i

distinct from the “power” question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
that hasn’t always been the Court’s view.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court has flipped and flopped, back and forth again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’ll focus on the era from 1968 (<span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wirtz</i></span>) to the
present.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were several cases
involving the Fair Labor Standards Act, which was passed pursuant to the
Commerce Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the New Deal, the
Court said that Congress could regulate wages and hours and all that kind of
stuff in all sorts of industries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Congress was given general authority to do things like set the minimum
wage for people who work at McDonald’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Congress passed a minimum wage law that is generally
applicable to all sorts of kinds of workers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They extended the same law to people who work for state and local
agencies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are a few exceptions,
but most people who work for state or local governments must earn a certain
minimum wage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress says that these
workers’ wages and salaries affect the interstate labor market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Maryland v. <span
class=SpellE>Wirtz</span></i>, Maryland said that Congress may have Commerce
Clause power over workers in the state, but that Congress can’t regulate state
workers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court disagreed, saying
that there is no separate question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Congress
has the Commerce Clause power, then the Tenth Amendment is satisfied.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court basically said it was two ways to
ask the same question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Tenth
Amendment was declared to be redundant to the Commerce Clause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But then, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>National
League of Cities </i>in 1976, they said exactly the opposite thing and
overruled <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Maryland v. <span class=SpellE>Wirtz</span></i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was exactly the same question!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The issue was the wages and salaries of state
employees, but the Court came to the opposite conclusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But then, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Garcia v.
San Antonio MTA </i>in 1985, the Court reversed again!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court said that the federal government
could regulate the salaries of private bus drivers, like Greyhound drivers, and
that the federal government could also set minimum wages for public bus
drivers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>then</i>, in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>New York v. United States</i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Garcia</i> was not explicitly

matter, this case overruled <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Garcia</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court was embarrassed to admit it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>New

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Garcia

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But we don’t yet know the “contours” of this separate
inquiry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court didn’t say that we
were going to resurrect the analysis of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>National
League of Cities</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead, they set
up the “anti-commandeering principle.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They said that what was problematic about the laws in <st1:State><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>New York</i></st1:place></st1:State><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>or <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Printz</i></span> was that Congress has
inappropriately “commandeered” state governments.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
  normal'>New York</i></st1:place></st1:State>, Congress was said to unlawfully
commandeer state legislatures and tell them what to do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Printz</i></span>, state and local law enforcement officials were
forced to perform regulatory tasks by the federal government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the issue in the labor law cases was whether the federal
government can force states and state agencies to pay their workers a certain
minimum wage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Twice the Court said yes,
and once the Court said no.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this
isn’t about “commandeering”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Garcia </i>was
decided in 1985 and Rehnquist is on the losing side, he writes a dissent
basically saying “We’ll be back!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
haven’t heard the last of us!”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley
says that this suggests that the “anti-commandeering” principle is not the end
of the road.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley thinks they’re keen
to get another fact pattern just like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Garcia</i>
so that they can explicitly overrule it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then we won’t be quite as sure what the Tenth Amendment means.<span

state of flux.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So there are a few different possible Tenth Amendment
principles (the following quotes from a Foley handout):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>Congress

missing children.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

suggests that the ruling in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Printz</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>is not
limited to regulations on information.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We’ll also focus on the issue of terrorism tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley has been talking about the hypothetical of a
large-scale terrorist attack.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say
Congress, in an effort to put in to place some advance planning in the event of
a terrorist attack, says that there will be a combined rapid-response team
consisting largely of local law enforcement officers who will be under the
direction of the Department of Homeland Security.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In order to implement a decent rapid response
team, we need to rely on local EMS and police.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So let’s say Congress passes a law saying that in the time
of an emergency, Tom Ridge or whoever can require local officers to do certain
things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is that permissible under the
Tenth Amendment as interpreted in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Printz</i></span>?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say it’s a
real big emergency.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We would need a
rapid response at the direction of the federal government.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don’t have federal personnel on the ground
at all times, and we don’t want them, either.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We don’t want a federal standing army on U.S. soil.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We send American troops abroad as necessary,
but the idea of a standing U.S. army on U.S. soil is somewhat anathema to
us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We rely on state and local
governments to keep the peace.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Part of
the idea of the federal system of government is keeping some power out of the
hands of the central government and leaving it in the hands of local
governments to promote freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Would it be consistent with the goal of promoting freedom if
the only way to protect against terrorism would be to have a federal force that
replicates local government functions?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Is that what this decision says?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court says that we are not using a balancing test in this area of
constitutional law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are creating a
categorical prohibition of enlisting state officers to perform federal
functions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>no exception </i>to the principle for emergencies!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do we still take the Court at its word, given
that the opinion was written before 9/11?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of constitutional law has balancing aspects.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even free speech rights are balanced against compelling
governmental interests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems unlikely, however, that a state would object to
participating in a new program the federal government would adopt to deal with
terrorism.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The states pretty much all
agree.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, there may not
be complete agreement as to the details.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For example, not everyone is so hot on all part of the PATRIOT Act.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if a particular state wants to go
against a particular detail of Congress’s implementation of the plan?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Congress might try to induce the states through the Spending
Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress can’t mandate the kind
of background checks in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Printz</i></span>,
but maybe they can dangle some money in front of the states to induce them to
stick to the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What if Congress says the only way we can trace terrorist suspects
would be if local law enforcement officers submit monthly reports to the
Department of Homeland Security?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would
it be different if local police departments were forced to gather information?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only difference between this and <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Printz</i></span> is the
“emergency” aspect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So do we believe the Court when they say that there is no
emergency exception to the rule?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would
the Court cut the federal government more slack today after 9/11 than they did
in 1997?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley suggests we need to do a
reality check.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But don’t always trust
Foley as a predictor of Supreme Court outcomes!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about Congress’s war powers?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could Congress declare martial law?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they did, would the Tenth Amendment get
suspended?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>key
dispute</i> between the majority and the dissent in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Printz</i></span>: We’ll always need
cooperation and coordination between federal, state, and local
governments.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there is some dispute
about how best to do this, who gets the final say?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is it Congress as the elected representatives
of the American people (subject to the presidential veto)?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or is it the Supreme Court acting on behalf
of state and local governments?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The states are well-represented before Congress.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not like the Congress turns a deaf ear
to the concerns of the states <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>qua</i>
states.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dissent says that there are
ways to make accommodations politically.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If Congress passes a law that intrudes on the sovereignty of a state,
presumably it has done so for what it believes is a good reason.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So shall the Supreme Court allow Congress to
make that judgment, or will the Supreme Court instead say that the ultimate
authority lies with the governors of the states?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Are the members of the Supreme Court going to render a
decision that would destroy the country?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Say the government had a credible argument that under the Constitution,
as written, we can’t adequately handle terrorist threats.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would the Supreme Court say that the
Constitution doesn’t allow us to defend ourselves?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would the answer be different if the stakes
are higher?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Constitution doesn’t have a provision that allows the
President or Congress to suspend the Constitution.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i>
operate under the Constitution and the rule of law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other countries, people can suspend the
operation of the Constitution for a while when they say there is an emergency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In exercising its authority, the Court will always have a
dose of realism when it interprets the Constitution.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We live under the Constitution, the Court
will interpret the Constitution, but Foley says it will do so with a dose of
realism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This year, the Court has already granted cert in some
terrorism cases.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These cases don’t raise
federalism issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Supreme Court doesn’t have any power to enforce its own
judgments.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It relies on the executive
branch to carry them out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court is quite
sensitive to this point.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Printz</i></span> isn’t a
national security case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley says that because we’re in flux, the best principle
might be this: “Congress may not regulate state governments in ways that are
inconsistent with a state’s status or dignity as a sovereign government,
including regulations that force states to undertake specific actions
concerning their own citizens that a state does not wish to undertake.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress can’t be the big bully and push the
states around.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This “animating idea” is
bigger, according to Foley, than any of the detailed rules the Court has set
out to this point.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The reason why <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Condon</i> was unanimous was that the Court
didn’t see an affront to the dignity of South Carolina that they couldn’t sell
driver’s license information.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Printz</i></span>, we’re
talking about what police chiefs are going to do in their jobs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Police power is the most basic sovereign
power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Forcing local cops around seems
to the Court like an affront to the dignity of the states as sovereigns.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court says that we’re not doing
balancing, but they might try to “smuggle in” some balancing notions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There may be some “hidden” balancing even if
there isn’t any up-front balancing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Apply this to the terrorism example: The sovereignty of each
state may be dependent upon the existence of the union.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the federal government is ordering states
around to protect the union, that may not be as bad as ordering them around for
some domestic policy interests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The object of the Fourteenth Amendment was to constrain state
power in certain ways.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>States can’t
suddenly assert the Tenth Amendment as an objection to an equal protection
claim.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The states have no right to take
away equal protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>New York</i> and <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Printz</i></span> are not <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>compelled</i> by the text of the Tenth
Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majorities in these cases
are really being motivated by an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>idea</i>
about federalism and the two-level structure of our government.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That idea is always going to be on the minds
of the justices that care about the idea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In any constitutional case, you must be sensitive to this idea.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Federalism is always on (some of) the
justices’ minds!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, some
of the justices, like Breyer and Stevens, don’t like federalism!</p>

do so unambiguously.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) Congress can’t
place conditions on funding if those conditions are not related to “particular
national projects or programs”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(4)
Congress cannot use its spending power to induce states to perform actions that
are unconstitutional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court says that <st1:State><st1:place>South Dakota</st1:place></st1:State>
doesn’t challenge the statute in question under any of the first three
limitations above.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>South Dakota only
challenges the condition of federal funds on the basis that it’s an
unconstitutional regulation of liquor sales under the Twenty-First
Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court basically says that
the standard for determining whether the Constitution places limits on
conditional funding are not as strict as the standards for determining what
Congress can do directly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court
finds it dispositive that South Dakota has the power to keep their law the
same, even though it’s at some cost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>O’Connor disagrees that the condition is closely related to
the purpose for which the funds are expended.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>O’Connor says that underage drinking is not sufficiently closely related
to interstate highway construction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>O’Connor also thinks that the law is an exercise of
regulatory power rather than spending power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>O’Connor thinks that the Twenty-First Amendment gives this power solely
to the states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed and the

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s it about?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Congress let the Secretary of Transportation knock off 5% of federal

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>An aside</i>: One of
Foley’s primary goals in using the Socratic Method in class is practicing

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what are the key details about the federal law?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It will withhold money from the states unless
they raise their drinking ages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suppose Congress hadn’t done this through spending, but
instead simply made a law that said “Nobody can purchase an alcoholic beverage
if they’re under the age of 21.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would
that be within the Commerce Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Sure, probably.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it would
violate the Twenty-First Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
we only had the Commerce Clause, then there would be no problem.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’re talking about the sale of alcoholic
beverages, and this activity is sufficiently commercial that even intrastate
alcohol sales can be regulated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the
Twenty-First Amendment removes some things from Commerce Clause authority that
would otherwise be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>within</i> Commerce
Clause authority.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court
assumes that Congress could not enact a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>direct</i>
regulation of the national drinking age under the Commerce Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>was</i>
within the Commerce Clause authority, then there wouldn’t have to be any
separate Spending Clause analysis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
only need to list your law under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one</i>
of the enumerated powers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there was
Commerce Clause power, you might plausibly have a Tenth Amendment problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But because we assume it couldn’t be done under the Commerce
Clause, we need to try it out under the Spending Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s what the Court does.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that Congress can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>spend</i>
with respect to matters that are beyond any other power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, with education in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>, education is said to be something
that especially belongs to the states.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But the spending power is different!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The federal government can dole out money for education to the states
and condition it upon the teaching of a particular curriculum, even if they
can’t directly mandate such a curriculum.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Spending Clause has a broader <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>scope</i>
than the Commerce Clause, but it’s not necessary more <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>powerful</i> than the Commerce Clause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, the Tenth Amendment doesn’t give Congress any
powers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, a minority of the
Justices think this Amendment is irrelevant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The majority believes that it is a states’ rights provision that doesn’t
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>give </i>Congress any powers, but only <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>takes away</i> powers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Tenth Amendment is analytically different
from either the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The latter are “power” provisions; the former
is a “rights” provision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Supreme Court says that if South Dakota doesn’t want to
lower the drinking age, they can “Just Say No!” and give up the 5% of the
highway budget they get from the federal government.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, it is claimed, there is no intrusion on
state sovereignty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So let’s focus on the Spending Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court announces a four-point test for
Spending Clause cases: (1) <span class=GramE>The</span> conditions must be in
pursuit of the general welfare.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress
will get a lot of latitude in making this judgment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some cases suggest that the Court will give
Congress a pass on this question every time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(2) The conditions Congress places on grants must be related to the
purpose of the money itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
money comes with “strings attached”, there might be a connection between the
money and the “strings”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) The
conditional nature of the grants must be unambiguous.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute must clearly spell out to the
states what their choice is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What are
the strings being attached to the money?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It can’t be a “gotcha” where the money comes first and the conditions
come afterwards.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(4) Congress can’t
induce the states to perform any action that would itself be
unconstitutional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Twenty-First
Amendment would be an independent bar to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>direct
regulation</i>, but it’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> an
independent bar with respect to the spending power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s because the states have a choice!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Twenty-First Amendment says that the
states have a choice of how to regulate alcohol.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why isn’t the quid pro quo that’s being
offered (money for drinking age) outside the scope of the Twenty-First
Amendment?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court basically says that
in the domain of just spending money and offering choices rather than making
decrees, the Court will act like the Twenty-First Amendment is not a bar as far
as the Spending Clause goes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
kind of by fiat and could have gone the other way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court says that the federal government
can’t give money to the states if the states agree to give up something that
the states are not entitled to give up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you read between the lines, the Court suggests that South
Dakota didn’t do a good job presenting their case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At oral argument, South Dakota conceded that
they weren’t making the Spending Clause argument.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justice O’Connor thinks the argument that
they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>didn’t make</i> was a good argument
and doesn’t want to give it up!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley says that states’ governments have historically been

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The relatedness prong</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the difference between what the majority and the
dissent say about this prong?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a
tricky one!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why did O’Connor have a
different view of relatedness than the majority?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The money was related to highway construction and
repair.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The strings were related to
drinking age.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The perception of young
adults is that they are more likely to engage in drunk driving than other
people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority thinks that the
strings and money are legitimately connected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>O’Connor’s dissent<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Justice O’Connor wanted to look at relatedness in a little
more depth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does O’Connor mean when
she says that the money must be spent on highway safety <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>itself</i>?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>O’Connor says there
will be drunk drivers causing accidents in other age groups, plus young drivers
who will drive safely.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>O’Connor says the
law is thus both over- and under-inclusive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This concept becomes very important when we get to Equal Protection law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But when a condition is related to the spending versus unrelated
to the spending?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>O’Connor says that
conditions are acceptable, and regulations are not.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is the age limit a regulation and not a
condition of the spending?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>O’Connor’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>key concept</i> is that relatedness means:
“Here’s the money, you can spend it for X, Y, and Z, but not A, B, and C.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s conditions on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>how the money is spent</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As
opposed to: “Here is some money, and in exchange for the money you must agree
to obey the following rules.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She would
only allow the money to be conditional based on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>how it’s spent</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>O’Connor says a condition is regulatory when the restraint
goes beyond that wad of money itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
order to get such money, you must agree to spend <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>any money</i> you get in a certain way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>O’Connor believes this is outside of the Spending Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This crosses her line of permissibility
because it’s a constraint not on the money itself, but actually on the behavior
of the recipient of the money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>“Constraint on money yes, constraint on people no.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This case is from 1987 and the composition of the Court has
changed considerable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does O’Connor now
have more allies than she did in 1987?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She was all alone then.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But maybe
she could get Thomas and Kennedy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
didn’t get Scalia or Rehnquist’s votes, but that might just be because South

</span>Really good lawyers will read the briefs and the transcripts.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>An aside about
deference – a common thread<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To clarify a point from last time: The scope of the Spending
Clause is broader, according to the Court, than the Commerce Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court perceives Congress as having more
room to maneuver under the Spending Clause than under the Commerce Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="unitedstatesvlopez.htm">Lopez</a></i> says we can’t have a
nationally mandated primary school curriculum justified by the Commerce Clause
power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court will not second-guess Congress about whether a
certain economic policy will be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>effective</i>,
as long as the policy is enacted under one of the enumerated powers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Wickard</i></span>, the regulation of <span class=SpellE>Filburn’s</span>
wheat might not have been <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>necessary</i>
to get us out of the Depression, but the Court gave Congress deference as to
the means Congress chose to stoke interstate commerce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The idea of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deference</i>
is very important throughout this semester with respect to every subject we’ll
study.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every case we’ll see this
semester is, in a sense, about deference.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Every case includes a constitutional challenge to what the government
wants to do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In many cases, statutes (legislative
power) will be challenged, while in some other cases, executive power will be
challenged.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whenever the Court is begin
asked to invalidate an exercise of governmental power on the grounds that such
exercise is unconstitutional, the Court, implicitly or explicitly, asks the
question: “How much deference should our part of the government give another
governmental authority to do what it feels is right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If Congress has passed a law, presumably Congress believed
itself to be acting constitutionally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Congress isn’t in the business of violating its own oath.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every time the Supreme Court overrides an act
of Congress, it overrides the judgment of the members of that body.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is, in a sense, an indictment of the
integrity of another branch of government.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So the Court always thinks to itself: “How much latitude should we give
Congress on this issue?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Deference cuts through all the topics we’ll cover in this
class.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It also relates to the “standard
of review” the Court should apply when adjudicating the particular
constitutional claim in front of it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
higher the standard of review, the more scrutiny the Court gives the relevant
government agencies involved.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A rigorous
standard of review is used, for example, in freedom of speech claims.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A lower standard of review or scrutiny gives
the government more deference.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So in
each topic we study, we’ll ask what standard of review will apply with respect
to each case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foley says that the Court is struggling with the standard of
review issue in the area of federalism.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE>Breyer’s</span> dissent in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>
says that the “rational basis test” applies to Commerce Clause analysis.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The “rational basis test” is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very</i> relaxed standard of scrutiny.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means Congress gets a big benefit of the
doubt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Breyer thought the Court
shouldn’t make a judgment about whether guns near schools would lead to damage
to the interstate economy, but rather the Court should review whether Congress
could <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rationally think</i> that guns near
schools <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could conceivably</i> lead to
damage to interstate commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Breyer
would say as long as such a connection is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>conceivable</i>,
Congress is entitled to make it and have it upheld.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the Court didn’t really respond to Breyer on that
point.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority focused on the fact
that Breyer couldn’t come up with a law that would go over the line if the
statute under consideration was upheld.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That leads us to ask whether the level of review in Commerce Clause
cases has been raised.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley says that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Morrison</i> have not clearly set out just what standard of review the
Court is applying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We saw last week in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>South
Dakota v. Dole</i> references to the “rational basis test” as part of the
inquiry in a Spending Clause case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
was the test for applying the “general welfare” prong.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority and dissent parted ways on the
“relatedness” prong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justice O’Connor
was unwilling to apply such a loose standard of review as allowed by the
majority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that you could applying different amounts of deference,
or, in other words, different standards of review with regard to different
parts of a test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court can let the
standard of scrutiny “float” up and down, even within the same case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So pay attention to what level of scrutiny is
being used.</p>

Spending Clause or some other enumerated power?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

powers in order to be constitutional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>The majority starts
by saying that </span>§ 666 is not a condition on the receipt of federal funds
and cannot be sustained on that basis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The court notes that § 666 does not address itself to the conduct of the
recipient of federal funds, but rather to the conduct of third parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, the court does find that § 666 is constitutional
under a combination of the Necessary and Proper Clause and the Spending
Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute doesn’t seem to hold
up under the Spending Clause alone, so the court looks elsewhere in the
Constitution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court cites authority
for the proposition that the Necessary and Proper Clause, among other things,
allows Congress to pass laws that help it disburse federal funds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court sees the Necessary and Proper
Clause as an affirmation that Congress can use a wide range of <i

enumerated <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ends</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The court says that the issue therefore boils down to
whether § 666 is an appropriate means to achieve a constitutional end under the
Spending Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are two questions
to be answered: (1) Can Congress enact criminal legislation under the Necessary
and Proper Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) Is the enactment
of § 666 rationally related to the desired end?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The majority has no problem finding support for their
conclusion that the federal government has the power to pass federal criminal
laws to help enforce its constitutional powers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The majority further claims that § 666 is rationally related to its goal
of protecting the integrity of federal funds and not so broad as to regulate
purely state or local criminal conduct.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

of the fact that at oral argument the government disavowed the Necessary and
Proper Clause as a basis for upholding § 666.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Appellant</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is the statute facially unconstitutional?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The most important issue according to the
government is stare decisis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They say
that the Supreme Court has already considered the basis of the defendant’s
motion to dismiss and has already rejected it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The district court’s order is purported to conflict with the holding of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>United States v. Salinas</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In that case, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that §
666 was not allowed under the Spending Clause without the requirement that
government show an effect on federal funds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The government claims that the only way to distinguish the petitioner’s
argument in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Salinas </i>and the
defendant’s argument here is that while the petitioner in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Salinas</i> was asking for the statute to be declared unconstitutional
as applied to him in particular, <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> wants the
district court to declare the statute unconstitutional as applied to everyone,
including, the government points out, Salinas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But, the government says, the Supreme Court has already found that the
statute <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> constitution as applied to
Salinas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The government claims that the
Supreme Court’s ruling in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Salinas</i>
committed that Court as well as lower courts to applying § 666 on an as-applied
basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The government cites some sources for the belief that § 666
is constitutional under the Spending Clause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the judges asks why § 666 cannot be justified under
the Necessary and Proper Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
United States attorney says that the fear is that the Necessary and Proper
Clause would “prove too much” and potentially run afoul of the Tenth
Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“You’re rejecting a
lifeline.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“No, your honor!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A judge asks whether forcing <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span>
to make an as-applied challenge at the close of the evidence would shift the
burden of proving a federal “nexus” or connection from the government to the
defendant (who would have to show a lack of a connection).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another judge points out that even if the district court is
affirmed, the defendant doesn’t get to walk, but rather will have to face the
music in Minnesota state court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
United States attorney says that part of the motivation of Congress in enacting
§ 666 was that local official might not be trusted if they were involved in the
bribery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’d like to save the remainder of my time, if I

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Appellee<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The appellee claims that § 666 is the only statute they can
find that is purportedly allowed under Congress’s Spending Clause power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He claims that Congress doesn’t have the
power to pass federal criminal statutes under that Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the judges says that even though the
Constitution doesn’t explicitly authorize statutes like this, there is a strong
federal interest in protecting federally funded programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The appellee says that the purported authorization of § 666
and other potential federal criminal statutes under the Spending Clause plus
the Necessary and Proper Clause would result in a general police power and
therefore no limit on what criminal conduct the federal government could
regulate, so long as it could claim it was protecting the “general welfare”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The appellee disputes that the section of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Salinas</i> cited by the government is
really the holding of that case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
appellee says that the constitutional question was not part of the petition for
certiorari and that the issue was not briefed by the parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The judge asks about the so-called “cross-cutting
conditions” on federal grants like anti-discrimination provisions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could § 666 be considered an
“anti-corruption” condition?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
appellee kind of dodges the issue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> was a developer in <st1:State><st1:place>Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was indicted for allegedly bribing a city
council member.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Who indicted him?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was indicted by a federal prosecutor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What federal law is <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span>
alleged to have violated 18 U.S.C. § 666.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Are there some funky words in the statute?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does it mean to “corruptly” give
something?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It can be “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anything</i> of value”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It can be given to “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>any</i> person”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute
applies not only to state and local government but also Indian tribes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute doesn’t specifically target state
officials.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute actually also
includes non-governmental organizations that receive federal funds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute seems pretty broad!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The size of the bribe could be much lower
than the threshold value.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The threshold
seems to deal with not the size of the bribe, but the size of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>business</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>transaction</i> that the wrongdoer is seeking to influence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the statute’s words seem to say that giving <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anything</i> of value to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any person</i> with the intent of
influencing a state agent or agency will be bribery.<span

authority?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Congress has written this statute and yet Congress has
limited scope of authority.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress has
the commerce power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could this statute
be justified under that power?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress
is spending money. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Could this statute be
justified under the Spending Clause?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does the challenge in this case have to be a facial

have brought an as-applied challenge instead?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How is <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> using the term “facial
challenge”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why is it that the analysis of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

issues?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We’ll talk about the disagreement of the majority and
dissent in regard to the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the dissent reads this statute, the
federal government could jail someone for bribing a meat inspector even though
the city might only get money for its parks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Is this a correct reading of the statute?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We talked at length about the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 666
yesterday.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, let’s focus on the
constitutional argument that <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> is making as to
why the statute is unconstitutional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What part of the Constitution does <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> cite
in support of his point?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> claims that the statute is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>facially</i> unconstitutional.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How come?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Is it a matter of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>relatedness</i>
between the bribe and federal spending?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Is there an inadequate “jurisdictional hook” in the statute?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What was the “jurisdictional hook” issue in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>the “substantial
effect” test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The question is whether
the statute addresses, for example, “interstate commerce” and only allows
prosecution if the conduct is related to that power of Congress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>§ 666 does not have a jurisdictional hook <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>of that type</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i>
a requirement that the bribe be received by a government or organization that
receives a minimum of $10,000 in federal funds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why isn’t the $10,000 part of the statute a jurisdictional hook?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not a Commerce Clause hook, but that’s
not the constitutional peg on which we’re trying to hang this statute.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could it be that we have a jurisdictional
hook but that the hook is insufficient?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We could say that Congress <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>attempted</i> a jurisdictional hook here.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress didn’t say that we’re going to
punish <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> acts of bribery against
state and local officials.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They limited
the statute to agencies that receive a minimum amount of federal funds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there may be an insufficient connection
between the bribe and the federal interest that’s being protected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The existence of a jurisdictional hook is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>type</i> of connection or nexus.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case insists that an element of the
crime is the fact that an agency received $10,000 in federal funds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That creates a connection between the conduct
to be criminalized and the Spending Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But this connection might not be good enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A jurisdictional hook is an element of the statute that is
explicitly tied to the source of federal authority.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The presence or absence of a jurisdictional
hook is important to the courts’ reasoning, but it’s only one factor to be
analyzed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is the Court going to do?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley thinks the federal government has four
safe votes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if cert was granted, it
means there are at least four justices interested in reviewing the case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>“Facial” challenges</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why does <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> insist he’s
bringing a “facial” challenge?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE>Sabri</span> wants to challenge the statute “on its face”, that
is, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as written</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He claims that the statute, as written, is
improper.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This concept is in contrast to
an “as-applied” challenge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In such a
challenge, you claim that the statute isn’t faulty on its face, but it is
defective as applied to a certain situation (i.e. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>my </i>situation).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> doesn’t go with an
as-applied challenge because it would be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sure
loser</i> for him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How come?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, the facts don’t look good for <span
class=SpellE>Sabri</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, note that this case is coming up on a motion to
dismiss an indictment rather than to overturn a conviction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district court granted the motion to
dismiss the indictment, which is why <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> never got
to trial.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The whole question of “facial”
versus “as-applied” challenges has nothing to do with <span class=SpellE>Sabri’s</span>
guilt or innocence as it would be proved to a jury.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bribe is merely “alleged”, but for the
purposes of this challenge we could accept the facts as given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But why would an “as-applied” challenge fail?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court will ask similar questions in the
cases of both “facial” and “as-applied” challenges.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example: Is this statute <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i> constitutional, in each and every
instance that it could apply?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s one
extreme.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, is there a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>single instance</i> in which the government
could constitutionally bring charges?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There’s the other extreme, and the two extremes define a range in the
middle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> was said to benefit from the
federal funds in connection to the bribe that he was giving.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> was trying to
get a community development grant, and the grants came from the federal
government!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span>
was trying to get $800,000 in federal funds!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He was going to kick back $80,000 to a councilmember in order to get
help getting that cash!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> wants his development
project to receive a portion of the federal funds, and his bribe is an effort
to try to obtain those funds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
statute doesn’t require that kind of connection, but given that connection it
seems like the prosecution is okay in this case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> can’t get the
indictment dismissed in its entirety if he brings an as-applied challenge.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Sabri’s</span> fact
pattern has the kind of nexus that he argues the statute must have in order to
be constitutional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>That’s why an as-applied challenge would fail</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> doesn’t claim that his
conduct can’t constitutionally be punished by Congress.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> instead
claims that the statute Congress wrote to get after him was a badly written
statute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Salinas</i> is
referenced in the briefs and the opinion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That case involved money which the federal government had been giving
out to state and local agencies under a prison program.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court said that the statute applied to
that fact pattern and that it was constitutional to apply it <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in that context</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems clear that it is legitimate for Congress to try to
stop people from bribing state and local officials to try to get at federal
funds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it turns out that at least <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>some</i> applications of this statute are valid and permissible.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This statute is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i> 100% unconstitutional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is not necessarily 100% constitutional, but it could also be
somewhere in between.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a doctrine that says if the statute would be valid
as applied to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i>, then you don’t
have standing to sue to protect third party rights.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> tries to get
around this by saying that even though <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>he</i>
could be punished under a better written statute, there are some people who
can’t get punished at all because of the way the statute is written.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> is asking the court to say that
just because the statute is written defectively, that makes the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>statute itself</i> invalid in all its
applications, because every time the government <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>punishes</i> under that statute, it punishes in a situation where it
doesn’t have to ask about the “nexus”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE>Sabri</span> thus argues that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>every</i>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So for a given law, the Court is more likely to uphold it if
most prosecutions that could be brought under the law are constitutional than
if most such prosecutions would be unconstitutional, even if in this particular
case it would be okay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other hand, if a statute would usually be unconstitutional
but it wouldn’t be in the present case, we might not want to let a particular
rascal off the hook when other people will soon come before the Court who have
really been wronged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the “onion ring” on the right gets so skinny that it disappears,
it means that the statute is <span class=SpellE>coterminal</span> with the
extent of congressional authority.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Every</i> prosecution would be okay.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> must show
that there is at least some kind of donut or onion ring in existence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, there are two questions <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span>
has to answer:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l5 level1 lfo6;tab-stops:list .5in'>Is §
     666 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ever </i>unconstitutional?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l5 level1 lfo6;tab-stops:list .5in'>Should
     <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> be allowed to kill the statute and get off
     the hook even though his own misconduct could properly (constitutionally)
     be punished?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why should <span
     class=SpellE>Sabri</span> be able to win with respect to the “donut” when
     he’s in the “hole”?</li>
 <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l5 level2 lfo6;tab-stops:list 1.0in'>Furthermore,
      what percentage of the statute’s coverage is constitutional versus
      unconstitutional?</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l5 level2 lfo6;tab-stops:list 1.0in'>How
      high does the percentage need to get in order to let the rascal <span
      class=SpellE>Sabri</span> off the hook on the basis of a facial challenge
      even though he would fail on an as-applied challenge?</li>
 </ol>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bigger the “donut” in relationship to the “hole”, the
more sympathetic the Court will tend to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recall the special rules and doctrines of the First
Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re in the hole, you
have to prove that the statute in question is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>substantially </i>overbroad.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Court has never quantified this, though.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But you need more of a “fat donut” than an “onion ring” to prevail on an
as applied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One example of an application of the “substantial <span
class=SpellE>overbreadth</span>” doctrine was the challenge to the
electioneering communications “60-day rule” in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>McConnell</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it ends up somewhat unclear why <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span>
thinks he’s entitled to a facial challenge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you want more information on facial versus as-applied challenges,
check out Edward B. Foley, “Narrow Tailoring” is Not the Opposite of “<span
class=SpellE>Overbreadth</span>”, 2 Election Law Journal 457, 472-475 (2003).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Facial challenges are often frowned upon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Judges don’t like criminal defendants to win
when they could be legitimately punished.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The misdeed that Congress punished <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is
</i>properly punishable by Congress, so to let a criminal off the hook just
because Congress was a little sloppy is unappealing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But because we care so much about First
Amendment rights, we don’t want people to self-censor even though they’re “in
the donut”, saying stuff that Congress can’t touch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So we’ll sometimes let people in the “hole”
win for the sake of other folks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Alternatives to § 666</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we define the proper scope of congressional power in
this area?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How can we pin down just how
big the “inner circle”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The way to mentally test the proper scope of congressional
authority is to imagine both narrower and broader laws that Congress might have
adopted rather than the one it actually adopted in § 666.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then we think about whether one of these
hypothetical alternative statutes would have been a good place to try the line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> demands that the law be
written such that the only thing it covers is punishment of bribes made with
the intent to get at federal funds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE>Sabri</span> wants to claim that that’s as far as Congress is
entitled to go.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress appears to have
gone a lot further than this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The government, on the other hand, says that that’s not
broad enough.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The government is not only
concerned about having federal funds get into the hands of the briber.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The government is also worried that if it
gives money for a purpose to a state or local agency, and that agency has an
employee who accepts a bribe, a lot of other money will get dissipated and thus
hurt the agency and in turn hurt the federal government’s program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The federal government wants to say that we ought to have
some kind of broader powers than merely punishing a briber trying to get
federal funds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about punishing someone who bribes an administrator of
a program that gets federal funds?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Consider the meat inspector/parks example again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about punishing someone who bribes someone who works
for a government department or non-governmental organization that gets federal
funds?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The difference between this and
the actual statute is that it deals with government <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>departments</i> rather than entire <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>governments</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Part of the problem with § 666 is that it
covers, for example, the entire state of California.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>California has a huge bureaucracy!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If any employee of the state of California <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anywhere</i> takes a bribe, then it would
seem like we can argue it’s necessary and proper to punish that employee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But what about even broader laws?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not just bribes that put federal funds
at risk.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if we also punish fraud or
financial deceit?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about punishing <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> dishonest act or statement?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The amicus brief suggests that it’s not much more far
fetched that the government could punish adultery offered in connection with
recipients of federal funds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Sabri’s</span> attorney will be asked at
oral argument: “If this statute isn’t okay, what statute <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>is</i> okay?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court wants to
put the lawyer on a slippery slope and really see where the line should be
drawn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Examples are good!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They put concrete images in the mind of the deciding judge.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does Congress have a valid interest under its spending power

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sabri</i></span>,

</span>Well, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dole</i> analysis is for
something totally different.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why does
that analysis involve a separate problem?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this case, the federal government is contracting with the
city of Minneapolis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The federal
government doesn’t just hand out money with no strings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You actually have to use the money to

</span>Minneapolis is certainly obligated to do something in return for getting
the federal funds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that’s not what
this case is about.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s has to do with the third party!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This criminal statute regulates the conduct
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>third parties</i>, and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> the recipients of the money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This law is directed against <span
class=SpellE>Sabri</span> and others in his position.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The law is not directed against the city of
Minneapolis as the recipients of the funds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is different than <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dole</i>:
The state of South Dakota itself was having restrictions imposed on it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It wasn’t 19 year old potential drinkers who
were directly regulated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the goals of this course is to translate what we know
into the most specific legal language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notwithstanding the difference between the cases, can we
make an argument from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dole</i> that will
help in this case?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could try to make
an argument from O’Connor’s dissent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does this statute go beyond the scope of protecting federal
funds?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is it regulatory in a sense that
will bother Justice O’Connor?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, in
some sense, of course it’s regulatory.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We want to regulate people who engage in bribery.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we’re not just invoking the Spending
Clause, but also the Necessary and Proper Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We could argue that the statute is necessary
and proper for enforcing the spending power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How else can we use the “ethos” of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

that this law, because it’s so broad and attenuated, it must flunk the
Necessary and Proper Clause as not really necessary under any definition of
that term.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, one of the amicus
briefs for <span class=SpellE>Sabri</span> argues that “necessary” really means
“necessary” and not just convenient!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe there is a way to use <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have our necessary and proper points.<span

perspective of the state governments whose interests the Constitution is trying
to protect by limiting federal power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>From that point of view, if Congress has the ability to use the
Necessary and Proper Clause in the way that the government is arguing here,
then there will be federal regulation that kind of piggybacks on all the
spending in which Congress engages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We expect state and local law to punish state and local
officials.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if we allow this new
power to tag along, then whenever Congress spends more than $10,000, you add
this “hidden condition”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So this isn’t a
direct <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dole</i> argument, nor is it a
direct <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> argument.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it appeals to the fundamental federalism
values expressed in those cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dole</i> was a quid

buried in the government’s brief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The amicus brief kind of falls between the two in Foley’s

<p class=MsoNormal>It is theorized that these split opinions have happened less

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But when there’s such a split decision as this, we know it
was a difficult case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It may be that
when we get some turnover on the Court we’ll get more fragmentation in

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You need to make sure that you have an

</span>What’s going on here?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is the Medicaid statute?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a federal statute that uses federal
money to provide additional funds for needy people who would otherwise not be
able to get medical care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The states can set up a prescription drug benefit as part of
the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the Maine Rx statute?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Maine adopts a program that’s not just for the neediest folks who are
covered by Medicaid, but also other folks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The district court grants the injunction, while the Court of
Appeals reverses, and the Supreme Court justices disagree.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a lack of factual clarity because the
case is at the level of summary judgment in procedure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems as though even though all Maine residents are
covered by Maine Rx, it’s a bit tricky.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you’re a Maine citizen and have private health insurance (a
comparable or superior plan) then you wouldn’t get your drug benefit from Maine
Rx itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What Maine Rx is designed to
do is provide prescription drug coverage to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>uninsured</i>
Maine citizens.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The people who would be
helped would be those who were too rich to qualify for Medicaid, but not rich
enough to get their own private insurance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does the state’s provision of a benefit under Maine Rx
affect the Medicaid program?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
Maine Rx program would be entirely free-standing, with no potential effect on
Medicaid, then there wouldn’t be a challenge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But the drug companies charge that Maine Rx interferes with
Medicaid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What do they mean by
interference?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s dense material.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Let’s “unpack”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suppose Maine hadn’t adopted Maine Rx.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Medicaid had been around a long time,
including in the state of Maine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How
would Medicaid have worked in the state of Maine in the absence of Maine
Rx?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Only poor people would have been
able to get discounted drugs under Medicaid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So the discounted drugs provision and the rebate is present both in
Medicaid and in Maine Rx.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the drug companies’ point of view, they have to take a
hit in terms of the prices that they charge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about this prior authorization bit?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would that exist in the Medicaid program
alone, putting aside the Maine Rx program?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Prior authorization was part of Medicaid itself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does that mean?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For certain types of drugs, authorization
would have to be obtained from a state agency.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They would check if there was a cheaper equivalent drug out there so
that the funding agency won’t take as big of a hit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HMOs do this often.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A
doctor says: “There’s this great new drug and I want to prescribe it for
you.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The HMO says, for example: “Try
Advil first, maybe you don’t need the fancy drugs.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The insurance mechanism intervenes in the
doctor-patient relationship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The doctor
must tell the insurance company why the particular fancy, expensive drug is
necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Medicaid has prior authorization <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>built-in</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Medicaid insisted
that the states adopted a prior authorization mechanism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If prior authorization was a feature of the Medicaid program
itself, why is the prior authorization so important when we’re thinking about
the relationship of the new program, Maine Rx, to Medicaid?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is the importance of the “interference”
theory?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The key concept here is that Maine Rx <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>imposed</i> prior authorization on any drug company that refused to
participate in the rebate plan for the folks who <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>weren’t in Medicaid</i>, but in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>another
category</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maine imposed a Medicaid
consequence for failure to participate in a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-Medicaid</i>
program.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“You’ve got to lower prices for
these folks who are falling between the cracks!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you don’t, then we’ll take the drugs you refuse to give lower prices
for and automatically put them in the prior authorization category for Medicaid
use!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note what we’re <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>
talking about: prior authorization for the people isn’t the only thing at
stake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Prior authorization is going to
become required for people who are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>already</i>
eligible for Medicaid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
“cross-cutting” nature of the punishment becomes the problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The penalty for not participating in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Maine Rx</i> would have been a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Medicaid
penalty</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a “stick” related
to the federal program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How did the drug companies make a legal claim out of the
interference point?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the Maine Rx
program doing to the federal program?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The drug companies are claiming that there is interference
by the Maine Rx program with Medicaid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They claim there is a conflict between the state law and the federal
law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where does the ability of federal law to trump state law
come from?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It comes from the Supremacy
Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>An act of Congress is supreme if
it’s constitutional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Inconsistent state
law must give way by virtue of the Supremacy Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What makes this a constitutional law case is
the Supremacy Clause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Medicaid is a federal statute.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no constitutional challenge to
Medicaid in this case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The drug
companies aren’t saying that federal Medicaid law is unconstitutional.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, they are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>relying</i> on federal Medicaid law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They don’t say that Medicaid is beyond the scope of federal power.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So if we assume Congress had the power to enact Medicaid,
then if Maine Rx is inconsistent with that federal law, then the state law <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must go</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Supremacy Clause says that when there is a conflict, federal law
wins.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>key point</i> is
that the constitutional proposition about the Supremacy Clause is
straightforward.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All the work of <span
class=SpellE>lawyering</span> in preemption cases is figuring out: “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Do we have a conflict between federal law
and state law?</i>”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there is a
conflict, preemption will occur.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if
you want to keep a state law, you must argue that it doesn’t really conflict
with any federal law.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does the Supreme Court try to find out if we have
inconsistency?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Think about the relationship between the Supremacy Clause to
the dormant (or negative) Commerce Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The drug companies make two claims: they make (1) a preemption claim,
and also (2) a negative Commerce Clause claim.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They say even if there is no inconsistency, the state law must be struck
down because it somehow interferes with interstate commerce.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we left off yesterday, we said that constitutional law
can’t tell us when a federal statute preempts state law, because the
Constitution only tells us that when there’s a conflict, there is the effect of
preemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But how do we know if
there’s a conflict?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Where do we look, if
not in the Constitution, to find out if there’s a conflict, and thus if there
is preemption?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We could look at the text of the statute or legislative
history.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the statute expressly states
that it is meant to preempt state law, then you’ve got a good case for
preemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>express preemption</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s
one of <span class=SpellE>Chemerinsky’s</span> categories.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress has the power to preempt state laws
that it doesn’t like as long as it is acting within its sphere of
authority.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the first thing to do is
to look for that congressional indication that they want to preempt, and see if
they’ve done so.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But there’s an even bigger point: preemption is ultimately a
matter of federal statutory law, not federal constitutional law!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We ought to be learning about preemption in
Legislation!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The answer to finding out
whether there is preemption in a given case will be found in the text of the
statute in question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we’re studying
it here, so there.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this area of “Constitutional Law”, we’re trying to figure
out what <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Congress</i> wants, not what the
original <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Constitution</i> wants.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So this is a bit different!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Preemption is not a
question of constitutional law!!!</i><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The constitutional part is quick, easy, and automatic.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we know what Congress wants, and Congress
wants to preempt, then we have preemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s it!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This class is mostly
about interpreting the Constitution, but the nitty-gritty of preemption is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not at all</i> about figuring out what the
Constitution wants.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But then the question is: just how closely do we stick to
the text?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Should we look at legislative
history?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Constitution says that state laws that are contrary to
federal law are null and void and must give way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that’s the only guidance we get in this
matter.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did the Medicaid statute expressly preempt the Maine Rx
program?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, there was no express
preemption provision.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Medicaid <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could have</i> expressly preempted state
laws.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But they didn’t.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That creates a natural presumption <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>against </i>preemption.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Congress doesn’t use a power that it <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could</i> you, you might suppose that they <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>didn’t</i> use that power for a reason.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does the Supreme Court as a judicial body understand
what Congress is doing or not doing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How
does the Supreme Court interpret signals from Congress?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe there <span class=GramE>are</span> some
overarching separation of powers principles involved.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s what the Legislation class is about,
though!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So Foley says that we should go
ask <span class=SpellE>Brudney</span>!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>express
preemption</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are three kinds of
implied preemption: (1) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>field preemption</i>,
(2) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>conflict preemption </i>(physical
impossibility), and (3) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>interference </i>or
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>obstacle preemption </i>(state law
interfering with federal objectives).<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s possible for the drug companies to comply with Maine Rx
in a way such that they are still in compliance with the federal Medicaid
program.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, there was not
conflict preemption in that case.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is an example where states have actually been invited
into the regulatory scheme.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, we
can’t have field preemption either.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therefore, the only possibility is that the state law
doesn’t conform to the federal law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
state law is called an “obstacle” to the federal law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is the state law such that Congress wouldn’t
want it to exist?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress didn’t say so
explicitly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But is Maine Rx such an
obstacle that Congress wouldn’t want this obstacle or this interference?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only way to answer this question is to
study the intent of Congress.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How should the Court figure out whether Maine Rx is an
obstacle to Medicaid?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The drug companies claim that Maine Rx interferes with and
is an obstacle to the long-extant federal Medicaid program.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do we figure out whether the drug
companies are right or wrong?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the
method?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chemerinsky proposes one method.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there is a claim of obstacle preemption,
you must know (1) what the federal objective is, and (2) what the purpose of
the state law is.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you have a claim involving obstacle preemption, you
have to know the facts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You must know
what’s really going on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We need a good
deal of substantive knowledge about how the state law works.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We also need information about the purposes
of the federal law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then we can ask
whether what’s happening under the state law is in conflict with the federal
law.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is it consistent with the federal Medicaid program for Maine
Rx to use the prior authorization provisions in the way that they do?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can we use the prior authorization provision
as leverage against the drug companies?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are the purposes and objectives of Medicaid?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is it out of sync with Medicaid to use it in
the way Maine Rx does?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These are not
constitutional questions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The answers
will come from studying and thinking about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Medicaid</i>
and thinking about what Medicaid needs and wants and why it exists.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If five members of the Supreme Court reach the judgment that
it is inconsistent with having Medicaid the way Congress structured it to have
Medicaid “hijacked” for this ancillary use, then we have a judgment that the
Congress that wanted Medicaid doesn’t want this hijacking!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then preemption follows…BAM!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But it’s still possible to comply with the hijacking without
violating Medicaid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>That’s
why this is not a case of conflict preemption.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not a physical impossibility situation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ever since the beginning of the country, the Supreme Court
has been absolutely uniform in stating that if Congress is acting within its
authority, state laws that conflict with what Congress is doing are
preempted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This can’t happen unless
Congress has the power in the first place.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Maine Rx program is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not
necessarily</i> an obstacle to the operation of Medicaid.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There isn’t enough evidence in the record for
the district court to strike down Maine Rx as an obstacle that is inconsistent
with the purposes of Medicaid.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Imagine if the <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>
legislature had said that a Medicaid punishment will be imposed in order to
extort more or less a tax from drug companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The district court thus alleges that the state could have used Medicaid
to achieve non-Medicaid objectives.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Supreme Court, when you add up the plurality, they say
that the actual program is less extreme than the hypothetical example.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It could be that Maine Rx’s purpose in
helping the people “in the gap” is consistent with the purpose of
Medicaid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, if the people in
the gap don’t get benefits and get sick, they might become poor and sick enough
to go on Medicaid and cost that program more money.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There’s also a federal agency involved: the Department of
Health and Human Services.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This department
has been given the authority to review state Medicaid plans and
procedures.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That department has not
ruled out <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>’s program.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the department didn’t like the Maine Rx
program, they probably would have issued a ruling against it.<o:p></o:p></p>

the right to regulate interstate commerce to the idea that states <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>don’t</i> have the right to regulate
interstate commerce?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we add the

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the relationship between the preemption doctrine and
the Commerce Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“We talked
yesterday about implicit preemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One
type is obstacle preemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a state

that law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a state law preempts
interstate commerce, then the federal government has the right to preempt that
law.”<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Dormant Commerce Clause is a form of implied
preemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It all comes back to the
same congressional power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress is in
the driver’s seat here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s Congress’s
power to regulate interstate commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Congress does that by enacting laws.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When those laws expressly preempt state law, state law must give way
because it is, by definition, interfering with Congress when Congress is using
its Commerce Clause power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are a
zillion ERISA preemption cases, for example.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With implied preemption, we look at implications of a
particular statute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the present case,
it’s the Medicaid law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the Medicaid
law <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>suggest</i> that the Maine Rx law has
to disappear?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It doesn’t directly say
so.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe you could have implied preemption with multiple
federal statutes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say Congress has
enacted two or three laws on a subject.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Or Congress could have so many laws about one subject that the states
may be understood to be unable to touch that subject.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That could be field preemption.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How could you have implied preemption without a federal
statute on point?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The idea is that
Congress wouldn’t want really bad interference with interstate commerce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress wouldn’t want state laws that are
protectionist in nature.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress fears
economic Balkanization and a return to the turmoil of the Articles of
Confederation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We will presume that
Congress wouldn’t want states to pass such laws even if Congress hasn’t said
anything about it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a matter of
policy, we want a “free trade” zone among the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United

</span>We’ll presume that Congress doesn’t want restrictions on that free trade
unless and until Congress says otherwise.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does that mean Congress is entitled to say to the Supreme
Court that they shouldn’t have invalidated a particular state law under the
Dormant Commerce Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if
Congress goes really state-<span class=SpellE>protectionisty</span>?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the Dormant Commerce Clause question in Maine Rx, the
court was unanimous in saying that there was no Dormant Commerce Clause
question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But suppose they bought the
drug companies’ argument and proclaimed the program to be an improper burden on
out-of-state companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be the
obligation of Congress to come back and say that they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

have to come back and explicitly give <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>
the authority to adopt this law even though the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled it
unconstitutional on Dormant Commerce Clause grounds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can Congress overrule that kind of decision
of the Supreme Court?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Congress could amend Medicaid and say: “NO MAINE RX!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That would revise the Supreme Court decision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the opposite is also true.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the dissent in the Maine Rx case had
prevailed and the Court had affirmed the preliminary injunction, if Congress
had not liked that, Congress could have overruled that judgment and said they
didn’t like the fact that the court overruled implicit preemption, and then
they can do it!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the difference between overruling and <span
class=SpellE>relegislating</span>?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
Congress doesn’t like what the Supreme Court says about its own product (Acts
of Congress), then Congress can say: “You folks blew it!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’ll amend and fix the Act!”<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It also could be the case that the Supreme Court was correct
in understanding what Congress <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>originally
</i>had in mind when it first wrote the law, but when Congress subsequently
understood the implication of its action, Congress may come back and say:
“Yeah, that’s technically what we said, but we don’t like that result.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Dormant Commerce Clause is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Think back to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Morrison</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Congress doesn’t like these cases, can
Congress say they don’t like what the Supreme Court did and write new statutes
to undo these cases?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>NO.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They would have to amend the Constitution!!!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Can Congress undo a Dormant Commerce Clause decision?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yes, because they have that power under the
regular old Commerce Clause!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
Supreme Court says there’s a violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause, then
Congress can simply exercise its power and reverse the decision!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s because Congress is exercising its own
power!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So is this a constitutional issue per se?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Notice that the Dormant Commerce Clause is
unlike any other form of Constitutional Law!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>These Dormant Commerce Clause decisions by the Supreme Court are
revisable by acts of Congress!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
don’t need constitutional amendments!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, don’t tell any federal judges this, but the Dormant
Commerce Clause isn’t really Constitutional Law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not an interpretation of the Commerce
Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s an interpretation of a
not-yet-existent act of Congress.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Congress can revise that interpretation just like it can revise
preemption decisions or any other statutory interpretation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have a case in which there is a state law and a

<p class=MsoNormal>(1) Are the <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
regulations an unconstitutional restriction on interstate commerce in violation
of the Negative Commerce Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) Do
the regulations unconstitutionally discriminate against out-of-state producers
in violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause? <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>States can only pass laws that burden
interstate commerce if they are authorized to do so by Congress.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A regulation <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>may</i> violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause even if it doesn’t
explicitly mention out-of-state citizens on its face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The exemption carved out by Congress is found to only relate
to composition and labeling but <span class=GramE>not</span> pricing and
pooling.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, Congress has not
acted to permit <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State> to
pass those particular laws.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>’s
milk regulations are neither exempt from Commerce Clause scrutiny, nor are they
exempt from a Privileges and Immunities Clause challenge just because the state
statute doesn’t mention out-of-state residents explicitly.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the latest word out of the Supreme Court!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s relatively short.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a narrow decision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s almost unanimous except for a dissent in
part by Thomas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s an example of where
the Court looks at an act of Congress and says that it makes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>certain</i> state laws permissible (milk
content and labeling), but they won’t construe that act of Congress to immunize
discriminatory state pricing laws from a Dormant Commerce Clause
challenge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court will immunize some
state rules, but not others.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is an example of Congress would draft language to
protect a state law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They cut out an
exemption that is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>just </i>for the state
of <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Ninth Circuit blew it when they said that
the laws allow discrimination in terms of pricing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court says that we don’t construe
the statute as protecting state law<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> that</i>
far.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress is in control, and the
Supreme Court just has to figure out what Congress wants.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>But</i>, there’s a
separate Privileges and Immunities Clause claim in the case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does
not</i> have the last word on this Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That claim goes forward on its merits regardless of what Congress says
or wants.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a holding about
whether it matters that the state law isn’t written <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>explicitly</i> in terms of discriminating against out-of-state
citizens.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court says no matter what
has been said in the past, “the absence of an express statement in the <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
laws and regulations identifying out-of-state citizenship as a basis for
disparate treatment is not a sufficient basis for rejecting this claim.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>123 <span class=SpellE>S.Ct</span>.
2142 at 2147 (2003).</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a couple of general points to be made.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Discrimination, when you’re talking out
in-state versus out-of-state citizens, involves three different constitutional
provisions: (1) Dormant Commerce Clause – discrimination against out-of-state
citizens is presumed as a violation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2)
Privileges and Immunities Clause, and (3) Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You do all three analyses whenever you’re confronted with a
question of cross-state discrimination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You can’t answer the question until you’ve thought about all three
provisions.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Equal Protection Clause, like the Privileges and
Immunities Clause, is a right that belongs to individual people.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress can’t override it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only one they can override is the Dormant
Commerce Clause; they can’t override the other two.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is more than one Privileges and Immunities
Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a Privileges and
Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as opposed to the Privileges and
Immunities Clause of Article 4, Section 2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They function differently!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Can <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> say
that only <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> citizens are eligible
to be governor of the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yes, of course!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don’t need to read the Constitution to
discover that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if we just read the
text of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article 4, Section 2 we
wouldn’t necessarily know that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s because
being governor is not a privilege or immunity under the meaning of this
clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some forms of discrimination are
okay, and some are not okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Common
sense, as much as anything, will help us determine what’s okay and what’s not.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
cannot say that only <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
citizens can practice law in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These distinctions don’t come out of the text
of the Constitution itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next week,
we’ll talk about the difference between discriminatory benefits and
discriminatory penalties.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, isn’t
it discrimination to offer lower law school tuition to in-state students than
out-of-state students?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just because you
have discrimination doesn’t mean its invalid under any of these three clauses.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment is not primarily designed to stop discrimination, unlike the
Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article 4, Section 2.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Congress has not specifically passed a law authorizing Maine
Rx.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How can we tell whether we have a
Dormant Commerce Clause problem?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
claims are the drug companies making?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The companies suggest that <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>’s
regulations go outside of the state and regulate the behavior outside the state
of <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What behavior does the drug companies claim is being
regulated outside of the state?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
make an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extraterritoriality</i>
claim.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They claim that <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>
is setting the price of drugs in, for example, <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They claim that the <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>
law is just like the statement: “The price to buy <span class=SpellE>Celebrex</span>
at in <st1:State><st1:place>New Jersey</st1:place></st1:State> shall be $1 a
pill.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The companies claim that they’re
trying to set prices outside of their own state.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>
is not entitled to set prices for transactions that occur outside of <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s none of <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>’s
business what the price of a commercial transaction is in any other state.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the companies were right, they would win.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the Court unanimously rejects this
idea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They say that <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> dictating the price of drugs
in other states.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why are the drug
companies incorrect?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A syllogism is a proposition of logic consisting of two
premises: a major premise and a minor premise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The major premise is more general, while the minor premise is more
specific.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, major premise:
“All persons are mammals.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Minor
premise: “Socrates is a person.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Conclusion: “Socrates is a mammal.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If both premises are valid, then the conclusion necessarily follows as a
matter of logical reasoning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s very
good to be able to walk into a courtroom and be able to say: “This is true,
that is true, put them together and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>we
win</i>.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Identify syllogistic reasoning
when you see it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The way to destroy
syllogistic reasoning is to show that one of the premises is invalid.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>see
</i>a syllogism, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ask</i> which premise
you can attack.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can’t attack the
deductive conclusion given the two premises given that they’re structured in
that form.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can also string
syllogisms together.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Your conclusion to
one syllogism could be <span class=GramE>either the</span> major or minor
premise of yet another syllogism.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s going on here is the drug companies say: “No state
can control prices outside a state.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>
is controlling out-of-state prices in this case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>
can’t do it.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court says: “We accept
the major premise, but not the minor <span class=GramE>premise,</span>
therefore we reject your conclusion.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But how do we figure out why the minor premise is no good?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It ends up as a matter of economic analysis.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Major premises tend to be more doctrinal, while minor
premises tend to be more facts of reality.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In almost all Dormant Commerce Clause cases, you should hire
an economist because you’re not going to understand everything (or will
you?).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes the key point in a case
isn’t in a major premise but rather a minor premise (a point of fact).<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the economic truth that’s going on here?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The drug companies say that the in-state price is being
controlled.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If pharmacies can only
charge a certain amount from the consumer, they won’t be willing to pay as much
to the wholesaler, and thus there will be a limit to what the wholesaler is
willing to pay to the manufacturer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
there is no drug manufacturer in the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The transaction between the drug manufacturer
and the wholesaler is necessarily out-of-state.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s the extraterritorial dictation under the drug companies’ theory.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why doesn’t the Court say that the squeeze don’t matter
because it’s not a legal insistence that the drug be a certain price?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It puts a squeeze on you as a manufacturer,
but the idea is that you can eat some of the cost out of your profit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no necessarily one-to-one
correlation between the retail discounted price and the wholesale discounted
price.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe the manufacturer can
squeeze the wholesalers!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court therefore says that they don’t think the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>
is dictating out-of-state prices at the wholesale level.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The burden of the program goes onto out-of-state
business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is designed to benefit
in-state consumers at the expense of out-of-state businesses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why isn’t that discrimination even if it
isn’t necessarily extraterritorial control?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The law would operate exactly the same way if every drug manufacturer
moved to the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That shows that this is not a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>protectionist</i> measure per se.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not discrimination against out-of-<span
class=SpellE>staters</span>, but rather discrimination arguably against
businesses.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s compare this to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

if you don’t own a refinery in <st1:State><st1:place>Maryland</st1:place></st1:State>,
you wouldn’t be allowed to own a gas station in <st1:State><st1:place>Maryland</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No refinery can own a gas station.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>happened
to be refineries in </i><st1:State><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

station.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there weren’t refineries in
<st1:State><st1:place>Maryland</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s why <st1:State><st1:place>Maryland</st1:place></st1:State>’s
law doesn’t fail under the Dormant Commerce Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But <span class=SpellE>Walmart</span>,
Kroger, K-Mart, or anyone else could come in and perform the same function as

was not cut off.<o:p></o:p></p>

law struck down on Dormant Commerce Clause grounds?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They argue that the law <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>discriminate </i>against
interstate commerce?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, because <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nobody</i>, including <st1:State><st1:place>Iowa</st1:place></st1:State>
companies, can drive 65 foot doubles on <st1:State><st1:place>Iowa</st1:place></st1:State>

the speed limit is 75.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could we make the

than in neighboring states?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>Iowa</st1:place></st1:State>
residents would have to follow the speed limit too.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How would the truckers’ “burden” argument be translated to
the speed limit rule?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The truckers would
say: “Hey!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This unique speed limit law
slows us down!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’re trying to get
across the country with some goods.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All
the other states allow us to go 75 mph so we go quicker.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we get to <st1:State><st1:place>Iowa</st1:place></st1:State>,
they slow us down and make us only go 65 mph!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That costs more!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a burden on
interstate commerce!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We can’t get across
the country as fast if we can’t go 75 mph.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It can’t be that big a safety deal if all the neighboring states allow a
75 mph speed limit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>Iowa</st1:place></st1:State>’s
law is an aberration!”<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the nature of this argument is different that
discrimination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no argument
about protecting local industry from out of state industry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t argue that people out-of-state get
a better deal than those who live in-state.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The argument is that we have a national economy that depends on the
movement of goods from coast to coast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If individual states have their own idiosyncratic laws, that will be a
burden on the movement of goods through our interstate transportation system.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But why do they have to make the point that the 65 mph speed
limit doesn’t have a safety purpose?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>states have the right
to regulate their own highways in a non-discriminatory manner</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>States have the right to have speed limits,
traffic signs, and so on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The federal
government may create overarching rules with preemptive effect, but in the
absence of congressional legislation, states have the right to regulate the use
of their own highways.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Presumably, the trucking companies wouldn’t have a prayer of
winning the speed limit case.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The plurality opinion basically says that there is no safety
difference between a 65 foot double and either a 55 foot single or a 60 foot
double.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They think the measure doesn’t
make sense as a matter of safety, whereas a different speed limit would have a
better case for a legitimate safety measure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So the facts would be different if we were comparing 65 to 75 mph versus
60 to 65 feet.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Plus, it’s not like everyone agrees on the correct balance
between safety and other social interests.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There’s a difference between different policy judgments between states
and the lack of a difference at all.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>real</i> reason
why Foley thinks the plurality would see the speed limit law differently than
the feet-length law has to do both with the safety side and the burden side of
the balance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plurality finds that
the burden on interstate commerce is much greater with respect to the “feet
limitation” than with respect to the “speed limitation”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How come?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A speed limit just slows you down a little bit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if you have the 60 foot limit, you would
have to either bypass the entire state or split the double into two singles.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For those justices who believe in the undue burden inquiry,
not all laws will flunk the undue burden test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The tough thing to figure out is: Which “local burdens” are “undue
burdens”?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It all depends on the
cost-benefit analysis in context.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>UNDUE BURDEN INQUIRY???<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How many justices believe?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brennan will strike down the law based on discrimination,
due to the improper motivation in the legislative history.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Brennan and Rehnquist debate the use of
legislative history.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Brennan says you
can only look to what they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actually</i>
thought, but Rehnquist says you must credit what lawyers argue after the fact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, Rehnquist and the plurality argue about the use of the
“undue burden test”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would Rehnquist
actually find as a matter of fact that the 65 foot doubles are less safe than
the 60 foot doubles?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>No</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Rehnquist would leave it up to Congress.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Rehnquist doesn’t believe that it’s the judiciary’s job to decide which
kind of truck is safer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He doesn’t think
it’s a factual issue for the trial court to be ruling on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only question for the Court, according to
Rehnquist, is whether this factual judgment of the Iowa legislature was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>plausible</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s how the deference argument works.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rehnquist says it’s not his job to decide the
factual issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead, it’s the
legislature’s job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He supplements this basic point with the point about states
from all around the country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Iowa is
surrounded by states that allow longer trucks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s their right, but they don’t have to.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Iowa isn’t the only state that bans 65
foot trucks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you really wanted to go
from New York to California, you would have to switch around your trucks
several times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rehnquist believes that
states should do what they want, and Iowa should not be held prisoner by the
decisions of the surrounding states.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Only Congress has the ability to preempt to promote interstate
commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each state must draw the line <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>somewhere</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Back in the 1960’s when Iowa adopted the law,
most states only allowed 60 foot trucks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both opinions are pretty convincing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the essential point is the deference
point.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Congress can say otherwise, but
in the absence of congressional action, Rehnquist would let Iowa do what they
want.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The plurality uses the veto of the governor as a small fact
in the balancing test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It helps to show
that there’s not much of a safety benefit because the governor didn’t think
there was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, Brennan
makes the governor’s veto and its protectionist nature into a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>critical fact</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He claims that the balancing test is
unnecessary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The veto message and
exceptions written in the rule prove, according to Brennan, that Iowa has a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bad motive</i> which is to hurt out-of-state
trucking companies to benefit only Iowa residents.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Helping people in-state while hurting people
out of state is, according to Brennan, a classic Dormant Commerce Clause
problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In response, Rehnquist says that this evidence is “too
new”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The law was valid when written,
and there is no obligation for Iowa to update it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>key
point</i> for Rehnquist is that we won’t strike down laws because of some <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bad mental state</i> that some legislator or
the governor had in mind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s because
they could have passed the same law with a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pure
heart</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Courts can’t invalidate laws
because of a bad motive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Legislators
could just go back the next day and reenact the same law while strenuously
trying to think happy thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The important thing is the “triangulation”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Always remember that discrimination is the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>most important issue</i> under the Dormant
Commerce Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ask yourself if you can
make a discrimination argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then ask
whether your argument depends on evidence of motive, or whether you can base it
on the text of the statute itself or how it works in real life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, because the law remains unclear, we
can’t ignore the debate over the undue burden test.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we have a debate in an undue burden
case, the most important things to look at are the real world facts that
balance the burden with the benefit (e.g. safety).<span

justification!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is an ecological

some states, there can be direct sale to consumers of alcohol.<span

arguments and hope for the best.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The key to wine case is that if it were any commodity that
wasn’t covered under the Twenty-First Amendment, there would be no question of
a violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The state of Ohio <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cannot</i> allow
widgets to be sold directly to consumers <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only
</i>by in-state widget manufacturers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If all we had to think about was the Dormant Commerce Clause
and not the Twenty-First Amendment, there would be no problem and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>this would be an easy case</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This statute is not justifiable in the
absence of the Twenty-First Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It would clearly overextend the state’s authority to regulate interstate
commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there wasn’t a Twenty-First
Amendment, the states could regulate alcohol as far as health and safety go as
long as the regulations don’t favor local producers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, you could ban <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all </i>direct shipment without regard to
where the producer is based.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But any
such regulation must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>evenhanded</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only tricky issue is whether the Twenty-First Amendment
exempts the states from normal compliance with the Dormant Commerce
Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is an unanswered question
that the Supreme Court has waffled on in the past.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the early years, the Supreme Court seemed
willing to give the states a lot of latitude, but in more recent years the
Court scrutinized state laws in the area more closely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems like the Supreme Court will soon have to enter this
field again, given that the Second Circuit and the Seventh Circuit are going
one way while the Sixth Circuit is going another way, we have the classic
Circuit split, which cries out for Supreme Court review.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Sixth Circuit, they’re saying that the Twenty-First
Amendment gives the states safe harbor if they really have a good health or
safety interest in regulating alcohol.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In that case, they might not be subjected to strict scrutiny.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the court doesn’t see that here, because
they don’t perceive any health or safety justification for the discrimination
occurring here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Second Circuit goes completely the other way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They start with the notion that the state is
operating within the Twenty-First Amendment, and it must be proved that they
are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> acting within the
Twenty-First Amendment.</p>

only one company in each state can successfully install electricity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three kinds of laws in this case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First and foremost, there’s a law that says
that the licensee must be a Wisconsin company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The company that actually runs the power plant must be a
Wisconsin-incorporated company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next rule is that any holding company that owns a company
that has a license <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>also</i> must be a
Wisconsin company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, there’s a takeover rule and other provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first rule is found to violate the Dormant Commerce
Clause, but the other two are not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What if a company wanted to operate a hospital in the state
of Ohio, but it was an out-of-state business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

in the state of Ohio.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe there is a
law against having for-profit companies running hospitals.</p>

</span>He was caught in the zone of combat with an AK-47 in his hand.<span

he was captured in a context where the government alleges that he was in a
combat posture as a member of the Taliban militia, if not an enlisted member of
their army.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That case went up through
the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that the president has the
authority to detain <span class=SpellE>Hamdi</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Hamdi</span> is in custody
at the same place that Padilla is in South Carolina.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Fourth Circuit said that the president
had authority under the Constitution and also was granted authority based on
the Join Resolution of Congress after September 11.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Hamdi</span> raised many of the same
issues as Padilla.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is claimed that

that Congress hasn’t given the president this authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are the circumstances under which Padilla was
captured?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Padilla was coming back from overseas.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was arrested by the FBI pursuant to a
material witness warrant that had been issued by a judge.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Padilla had been in Pakistan.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why does the government think he was in
Pakistan?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The government has reason to
suspect that he has ties with al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is it important to find out if there was
a judicial finding of fact?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
evidence does the court have that Padilla has al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>
ties?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We haven’t taken Evidence, but we have taken Criminal
Law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If this were a criminal trial, has
the government presented any evidence against Padilla?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a declaration by Michael <span
class=SpellE>Mobbs</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He isn’t a
witness before the court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He didn’t sign

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can only testify to what <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i> know.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From a legal standpoint, there’s nothing here
that counts as evidence that Padilla has ties to al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>
or was involved in a plot to detonate a dirty bomb.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court can’t make any findings of fact
because no facts have been presented.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The government asserts that they need not provide any such evidence, but
need only assert that the president has made this determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are sealed and unsealed declarations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sealed declaration asserts that there is
evidence, but that evidence hasn’t been presented judicially.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even the sealed version just says that people
in the Justice Department have evidence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That evidence has not been presented in court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but
it’s just a fact about how the litigation is proceeding.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a lot different from an ordinary
criminal trial context.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In that context,
you couldn’t lock Padilla up indefinitely until he is convicted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everything Padilla is accused of doing is a
crime and he could have been prosecuted in an ordinary criminal proceeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The government doesn’t want a criminal trial in this
context.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t want to have to
expose who their secret witnesses are.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So: Can the government lock someone up who they think is a bad guy
without a criminal trial if they don’t want to have one?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider the Oklahoma City bombing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Suppose that was the work of a larger
conspiracy than just Timothy McVeigh involving, for example, a militia-type
organization.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The government captures
McVeigh but wants to prosecute the people he’s working for.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the government thinks that McVeigh is
guilty, they must put him on trial!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Padilla’s lawyer said that Padilla can’t be moved from the
criminal system to the military justice system because Padilla is a United
States citizen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In response, the
Department of Defense says that the president <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>does</i> have the authority to impose such a transfer based on the
president’s own determination that Padilla is an enemy combatant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We might ask whether, on the president’s
theory of the case, he would have to do anything more than <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>assert </i>that Padilla is an enemy combatant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that’s not what he did; he attached the
declaration of Undersecretary <span class=SpellE>Mobbs</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There wasn’t really a trial here.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe we want to prevent overseas agents from
having their cover blown.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But also,
there are lots of evidentiary problems.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The “evidence” in the military papers has nothing to do with “evidence
as advocacy”, but only with “evidence as fact”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The District Court and dissenting judge in this case believe
that although the president has some inherent authority to detain Padilla
indefinitely, there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i> judicial
oversight over this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The District Court
and dissent don’t believe that this is a probably criminal trial.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There may be a small fact-finding role to
take place: a “some evidence” standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>President Bush asserts that there is no judicial fact
finding role <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at all</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The extent to which the <span class=SpellE>Mobbs</span>
declaration gets tested in court is important, but also rests on some basic
legal questions that will soon be decided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Has Congress given the president the authority to detain
Padilla indefinitely?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We will apply the
Justice Jackson analysis to this set of facts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Justice Jackson in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Youngstown Sheet</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are the three categories that Justice Jackson
identifies in his concurring opinion in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Youngstown
Sheet</i>?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) When Congress has said
that the president can exercise a certain power, either expressly or
implicitly, then there is a strong presumption that the president has that
power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(“Yes!”)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) When Congress has been completely silent
or they are ambiguous, there’s kind of a grey area.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>(“Maybe!”)</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) At the other end of the scale, when the
president acts <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>against</i> the wishes of
Congress (explicitly or implicitly), the president’s powers are at a minimum
(“No!”) and are limited to the powers enumerated in the Constitution.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, the president has the power
only when the act passed by Congress is unconstitutional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dames &amp; Moore v.

the guidance of these categories.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, the Court notes that this is really a spectrum rather than
three discrete categories.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is very important to be able to go back and forth being
categorization analysis and spectrum analysis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Sometimes it’s useful to put things into analytic “boxes” that are clear
and well-defined.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But at other times,
it’s important for the legal system to soften those lines.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There may be examples of “Yes” and “No” that
aren’t polar opposites and not perfectly clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i>, which
Jackson box does the case fall into?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Second Circuit said that the president lacks the inherent constitutional
authority to detain citizens on American soil outside the zone of combat.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, they think that the Non-Detention Act
places the case in the “No” box and that the Joint Resolution doesn’t take it
out of that box.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Category 1”, the “Yes” category, is the one where Congress
says: “Go, President, Go!”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district
court thought that the Joint Resolution put the case in this box.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what does the government say?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the one hand, they talk about the inherent
constitutional powers of the executive branch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If that argument is made, it would be conceding that we’re in the “No”
category.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But then they argue that
Article II trumps Congress in certain areas or in certain situations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They also could argue that Bush was detaining
Padilla pursuant to the Joint Resolution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Or they can argue that the Non-Detention Act only applies to the
Attorney General and not the president.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The best category for the president to be in is “Category
1”…the “Yes” category!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do we get
there?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Joint Resolution is an Act of
Congress!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How will the Supreme Court structure the argument?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under the Jackson analysis, the first thing
you’re supposed to do is look at what Congress has said: look at the
statutes!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s not what this court
does first.</p>

Congress hasn’t authorized it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We find that the statute authorizes the president to use <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> “necessary and appropriate force”
against all sorts of people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But how can
he use force against Padilla in particular?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(What if Congress just passed a new resolution that
specifically included Padilla and others in his same position?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to the president, how does Padilla fit into the
language of the Joint Resolution?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
claim that Padilla is part of al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, since he’s allowed to use appropriate
force against that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>organization</i>, they
reason that he can use force against a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>member</i>
of that organization.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The president
argues that he is entitled to detain al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span> agents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>key point</i> is:
what is the relationship between Padilla and al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case says that the government doesn’t
allege that Padilla is a member of al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If this was the case, the Second Circuit
would see this case entirely differently.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

</span>Is this case distinguishable?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Padilla isn’t a member of al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>.<span

American citizen in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quirin</i></span>,
was a uniformed, paid solider of the German army.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a factual distinction between Padilla
and <span class=SpellE>Haupt</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Also, there is a question of whether or not there is congressional
authorization for the detention of Padilla.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quirin</i></span>
says that there definitely <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i>
congressional authorization for subjecting <span class=SpellE>Haupt</span> to
the military tribunal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If there is congressional authorization, what does that mean
for Justice Jackson’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Youngstown Sheet</i>

extrapolate backward to <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quirin</i></span>,
the court says that Congress, through its Acts including promulgating the
articles of war for the U.S. military, has authorized detentions and trials in
these circumstances.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But does the

<p class=MsoNormal>What is the essence of the reasoning in <span class=SpellE><i

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why does the Court allow an American citizen
to be subject to military jurisdiction when the citizen is captured in Chicago

the citizen is connected to the German army, but when captured in Chicago by
the FBI, he’s not wearing a German uniform.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He’s just roaming the streets of Chicago acting like a regular U.S.
citizen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the Court’s rationale
for allowing him to be subjected to military jurisdiction?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Haupt</span> was found to be an unlawful combatant
under the Geneva Convention or Hague Convention.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if <span class=SpellE>Haupt</span> had
been a lawful combatant of the German army?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Would he be entitled to a criminal trial in a U.S. District Court?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, he would have prisoner of war status and
would be subject to military jurisdiction, but of a different type than the
jurisdiction he was submitted to in this case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>POWs were simply treated differently.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The procedures for POWs would be more in the nature of
courts-martial.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You get more rules of
evidence and better access to counsel, among other things, in a court martial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If <span class=SpellE>Haupt</span> had not been a soldier or
had any other status in the German army, but had instead been a native-born
American Nazi sympathizer without orders from the German government, and he had
decided to blow up buildings in the United States, then under the reasoning of <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quirin</i></span>, could he
have been subjected to the same military tribunal that he was in the present
case?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does <span class=SpellE><i

Congress and the president to subject American Nazis to military tribunals as
opposed to civil prosecution for treason?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How could we determine whether <span class=SpellE>Haupt</span> was an
unlawful combatant?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court says that even if you’re an American citizen, you
may be an enemy belligerent if you associate yourself with the military arm of
an enemy government and use its aid to enter the country to try to commit
hostile acts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, <span

sly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quirin</i></span><i

normal'>Milligan</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Into which
category should it go?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did <span class=SpellE>Haupt</span> renounce his U.S. citizenship?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court declines to decide this.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They find that it doesn’t matter whether or
not <span class=SpellE>Haupt</span> is a U.S. citizen; instead, they believe
that it only matters that he entered the country under cover of night in a
German uniform to try to blow stuff up in the U.S.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of what’s being litigated in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hamdi</i></span> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Padilla</i> is that the government claims that it doesn’t matter
whether the individuals are U.S. citizens or not.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Hamdi</i></span>, they argue that <span class=SpellE>Hamdi</span> did
renounce his U.S. citizenship when he took up arms with the Taliban against the
U.S.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Padilla’s connection to al <span
class=SpellE>Qaeda</span> seems more tenuous than the connection between <span
class=SpellE>Hamdi</span> and the Taliban on the one hand, and <span
class=SpellE>Haupt</span> and the German army on the other hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other important point is the fact that al <span
class=SpellE>Qaeda</span> is not a nation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When you take up the uniform of a foreign nation at war with the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S<span
  class=GramE>.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class=GramE>, that</span>
could be a renunciation of citizenship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But what about taking up arms with a non-state terrorist organization?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The United States government wants to win this case on
presidential authority whether or not Padilla is a U.S. citizen: they don’t
want their power to detain to turn on U.S. citizenship.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it does, they will try to argue that
Padilla is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> a citizen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But why doesn’t <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Quirin</i></span> provide the president with all the authority he needs
to detain Padilla?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The defense wants to
argue that <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quirin</i></span>
is distinguishable, as noted above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does it make a difference that Padilla was caught at the
airport instead of at home?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Milligan was
captured at home, while <span class=SpellE>Haupt</span> was captured on the
streets of Chicago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if you were
caught at your place of employment?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quirin</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>tells us that the president can choose
military tribunals over criminal proceedings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When an American citizen is acting in conjunction with a foreign military
entity under certain circumstances, this option is available.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the precedent is unclear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problem of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i>
seems to be the fact that we’re not dealing with cooperation with the military
of another <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>country</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>An outline of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remember that there are two basic questions in
Constitutional Law: the “power question” and the “rights question”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we did the Commerce Clause, we were
dealing exclusively with power questions with respect to congressional
power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now we’re dealing more with
presidential power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is the source
of authority for this part of the federal government to act?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The power question is always a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>first stage</i> question.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Jackson analysis has to do with the power
question as well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could analogize
the Jackson analysis to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i>
test: it’s a methodological inquiry courts use to figure out the answer to the
power question.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i>
includes a second stage “rights question” as well.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In cases like <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Printz</i></span>, you had to ask both the
“power question” and then the “rights question”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or on the other hand, regulations on guns
might be allowed as a congressional power under the Commerce Clause, but it
might be prohibited as an abridgement of rights under the Second Amendment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i> deals with
both questions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the first part of
the week, we were analyzing the power issue using the Jackson analysis from <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Youngstown Sheet</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now we will analyze the rights issue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Congress can only get authority from the Constitution, while
the president can get power from Congress or from the Constitution itself
(Article II).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But then you have to ask if there are rights in the Bill of
Rights that limit these powers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quirin</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Milligan</i>
are mostly focused on this “stage two” question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Always bear in mind: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>power
questions first</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rights questions
second.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three separate ways to say that the president
might have the ability to detain Padilla indefinitely.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These follow the Jackson analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that if we say the president doesn’t have
constitutional authority, we never have to deal with the Fifth Amendment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are some rights-bearing clauses within the original
Constitution, like the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article 4, Section
2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, Article I §§ 9 and 10 say that
neither Congress nor the state can pass <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ex
post facto</i> legislation or bills of attainder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You never have to address the question of violation of a
constitutional right <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i> the
government lacks the power in the first place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if the president has the authority to detain Padilla,
that authority might still be limited in some respects.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, he might have to provide
evidence supporting the detention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under international law, administering a “truth serum” like
sodium pentothal is considered torture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But aren’t there costs and benefits?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Be sure to understand the difference between <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>power</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>rights</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But once you’re
comfortable with that, you should let yourself get a little bit fuzzier with
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the Supreme Court thinks about
the power question, they’ll have the rights question in the back of their
minds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One argument that may prove persuasive to some members of
the Court as a reason for saying that with respect to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>this </i>twilight zone case the president <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>lacks</i> that kind of inherent power is to say: We’re worried about
the Fifth Amendment implications if we grant this power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That not to say that they’ll get to stage
two, but they’ll say “no” at stage one <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>because</i>
they are worried about stage two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ex <span class=SpellE>parte</span>
Milligan</i> – How do the facts of this case and the holding of this case bear
on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can you distinguish the two cases?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Milligan</i>,
we had a clear congressional statute that said that someone in Milligan’s
position should <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> be subjected to a
military trial.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They said that any Americans
detained by the Union army had to be subjected to the ordinary criminal process
if certain conditions are met.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
specification provided by Congress of how to deal with these people did <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> include military tribunals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, we’re in category three.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a key point in the separate
concurrence in this case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
concurrence would use that as the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sole
ground</i> for releasing Milligan from military detention.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They would have settled the case solely on
the stage one power inquiry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“When Congress
has said no, then the president doesn’t have a power that overcomes that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other hand, the majority opinion went on to say that
Congress couldn’t have authorized such military tribunals even if they wanted
to.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court kind of overkills the
subject.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isn’t the concept of an advisory committee that you have
people outside the government giving the government advice?<span

they do not have to make the proceedings of the committee public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

Foley asks?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s really going on?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why do the organizations want these
names?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They want to know if Ken “Enron”
Lay was at the meeting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why would we
want to know that?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are a couple of
reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo9;tab-stops:list .5in'>It
     would be politically embarrassing to have an Enron person advising energy
     policy.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo9;tab-stops:list .5in'>More
     importantly, Enron was Bush’s single largest campaign contributor in the
     2000 campaign.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s where the
     real allegation of corruption comes in: Did Enron’s campaign contributions
     inappropriately buy the company a seat at the table?<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was there a quid pro quo?<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could this lawsuit <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
     normal'>prove</i> a quid pro quo?</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lawsuits might expose what was said at the meeting and
who was there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it’s unlikely that
any discussions during the meetings would actually reference campaign
contributions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All that these lawsuits
could reveal would be that campaign contributors were participating in the
committee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that’s all you can
get!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is that a reason to not let the
lawsuit go forward?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contrast this with Nixon’s tapes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>John Dean claimed that he was in the Oval
Office when there was a conspiracy to cover up Watergate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tapes could prove <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>whether there was a crime or not</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The connections were very close!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sierra Club and Judicial Watch don’t allege any
particular crime.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if the predicate
allegation is that Lay was at the meeting and that he was a campaign
contributor, they can’t show that airing these records would prove a crime of
any kinds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Presidents are entitled to meet with CEOs of
corporations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>FACA covers advisory
committees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is FACA constitutional?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every time the president decides to ask
American citizens for advice, he has to jump through certain hoops.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is that something that Congress can force the
president to do?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is this, in itself, a
Separation of Powers issue?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do we have an equivalent parallel in this case to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nixon</i>?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Will this case feel like Watergate to the Supreme Court?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is this an evil president who we have to stop
from subverting the system of government?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>According to Foley, this case isn’t going to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>feel</i> like Watergate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley
believes that this will be dispositive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court will find doctrine that will support this conclusion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley thinks the Court will find it
inappropriate to subject the Vice President and cabinet-level officials to be
subject to document requests like the one at issue in this case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if there is a real risk that Ken Lay improperly
influenced the Bush Administration, the FACA law wasn’t designed to prevent
such influence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you want to prove
that something was done improperly as far as campaign contributions, you’ll
have to narrow your target.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To win a
case under the terms of FACA, you don’t have to prove anything about campaign
contributions, because it doesn’t matter who was meeting with the president and
it doesn’t matter whether they gave money or not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This large has the potential to be hugely broad.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sierra Club and Judicial Watch have proffered
no evidence that Ken Lay was at the meeting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They just <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>think</i> he was
there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yet, on the face of the statute,
high level government officials could be exposed to a very expensive and
time-consuming process.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley thinks
that the Court will not let Congress do that with this law and will send them
back to the drawing board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, something about Monday’s assignment.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The New York Times has an article by Greenhouse about the
public release of Justice <span class=SpellE>Blackmun’s</span> papers from his
time on the court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s Foley’s
justice!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To what degree do justices change their own minds?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The justices feel the weight and pressure of
the arguments on both sides of an issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They can get tipped to one side of an issue only to get tipped back to
the other side later on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justices can
change their minds well into the deliberation of the case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about these lawsuits at the time of the Vietnam
War?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People filed lawsuits saying that
the war was illegal and unconstitutional because it was undeclared.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court would not judge this issue because
they felt that it was a political question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In fact, this is the quintessential political question doctrine
situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But what if someone was being sent to prison for resisting
the draft for an undeclared war?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Wouldn’t there be personal consequences to that individual?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would it still be a political question?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why would the Supreme Court say that they’re
not going to decide what the Constitution means even though they’re being asked
to do so by individuals who may end up in jail?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>enough</i> to say that it
is relevant whether the Court has in front of it an issue of rights or an issue
of powers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court is less willing to
get involved in a turf battle between branches.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The presence of a rights question is not dispositive in deciding whether
the Court will tackle the question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s just one factor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another
factor is whether the Court feels that another branch of government has more
expertise on the subject at hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another famous political question case was the “Pentagon
Papers” case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The New York Times
published some documents about the Vietnam War.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The government went to court to stop the newspaper from publishing the
papers, arguing that it would be a serious breach of national security.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The government invoked the political question
doctrine in this case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They said that
the documents were classified and should not be released.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead, the Court decided to protect the
freedom of the press.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In that case, they
felt that the Court must interpret the Constitution to allow the New York Times
to publish the information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we explain the difference between the two types of
cases?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court may not feel that they
have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>military </i>expertise, but they do
feel like the guardians of fundamental personal liberties.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What they won’t decide in the war powers
context is whether the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>war itself</i> is
permissible or impermissible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They won’t
get into the question of whether the president can send troops overseas without
congressional authorization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s hard to figure out when they will intervene; we have no
definitive rule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isn’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>everything</i>
in some sense a political question?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One
of the biggest debates over whether the Court should invoke the political
question doctrine has come up in the case of gerrymandering/redistricting.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There have always been claims that the ways
those boundaries get drawn violate equal protection.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is this a political question?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or is it the Court’s role to protect against
discrimination?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court could go
either way on this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a practical matter, when you have constitutional
litigation, you must ask yourself whether the court could possibly decide to
invoke the political question doctrine in this case, even if it hasn’t done so
previously.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is there a possibly that the
political question doctrine could be in play, even though on the surface of the
precedents you wouldn’t normally think that it was in play.<span

constitutional question could be considered a political question, but most of
them are not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about the case of Judge Nixon?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court said that it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>could</i> decide when it’s proper to use the impeachment power or not
and decide what the phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” means, but they feel
that this is a case they shouldn’t decide because decisions about the
impeachment power belong exclusively to Congress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court is going to think in practical terms.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“What would this mean for the country if we,
the Court, decided this question?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Should drawing district lines be subject to judicial management?<span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes you lose sight of the consequence
when you look at the question to be decided.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But the courts, as practical institutions, will be thinking: what’s the
remedial consequence of deciding this constitutional question?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Are there remedies less extreme than invoking the political
question doctrine?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can courts address an
issue but impose some limitations on their own remedial authority?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about equitable jurisdiction?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Equitable remedies, like injunctions and
orders, are thought to be somewhat discretionary on the part of the court
issuing them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A court could address a
question on the merits but delay or limit their remedy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Always think about the remedy issue.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How burdensome does the court think the
remedy will be?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court can soften the

<p class=MsoNormal>Virtually every law professor in the country when <i

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc71448076"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Levels of scrutiny</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three levels of scrutiny that the Court employs to
evaluate intentional discrimination (either facial discrimination or
discriminatory motive): (1) strict scrutiny, (2) intermediate scrutiny, and (3)
low-level scrutiny.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This should remind us of Justice Jackson’s three
categories.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These too are artificial
boxes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some justices want to blur the
lines and look at a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>spectrum</i> of
scrutiny instead of discrete boxes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
for the sake of simplicity to start out, let’s assume that there exist these
three well-defined boxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What approach will the Court take with respect to a
particular kind of discrimination?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How
hard are they going to be on the government initially?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some discriminations are wrong and
unjustified, while others are justified and permissible.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what is our initial presumption?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The choice of the level of scrutiny is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>predictor</i> of whether the discrimination
will be found to be proper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, racial discrimination falls into the category
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strict scrutiny</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Other forms of discrimination don’t get that
kind of presumption of hostility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example,
when the government discriminates between optometrists, opticians, and
ophthalmologists, it seems reasonable to think there is a valid reason.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Someone attacking such a rule, though it is
discriminatory, will face an initial presumption against them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each choice of the level of scrutiny is an
indicator of the judicial mindset as to the type of discrimination at hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you’re in the zone of strict scrutiny, the discriminatory
law must serve a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>compelling interest</i>
and the law must be necessary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
example, in California, they have had a long-standing practice of segregating
prisoners on the basis of race for the first 60 days until the prison officials
determine how dangerous and violent the prisoners are.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a practice that would usually demand
strict scrutiny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, there is a
doctrine that says that discrimination in prison will be treated differently
and possibly considered with the rational basis test instead of strict
scrutiny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe segregating prisoners
could be rationally related to the goal of preventing prison violence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But on the other hand, it may not be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>necessary</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, the test chosen may be entirely
dispositive as to whether the practice violates the Equal Protection Clause or
not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notice the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>totally
different </i>definition of necessary here than in the Necessary and Proper
Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Necessary” is much more like
“rational” in the Necessary and Proper Clause than here.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In equal protection jurisprudence, necessary <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really means necessary</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So how does this play out in real life?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
Court doesn’t always follow its own doctrine!</i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Consider <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Korematsu</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> v. United States</i>, where the Court claimed that the internment of
Japanese-Americans during World War II demanded strict scrutiny.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In practice, the Court seemed to only use the
rational basis test.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the government defends a discriminatory classification in
more than one way, you must analyze <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>each
interest</i> under the appropriate level of scrutiny.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is the classification appropriately related
to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>each</i> of the asserted
interests?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The government wins if it can
defend its classification under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i>
interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The government wins if it can
assert an interest that meets the relevant test and show that the law is
sufficiently related to that interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Thus, there is a kind of asymmetry here that works in the government’s
favor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about aggregation of
interests?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a tough question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, the government can be defeated one of two ways: either
by showing that the interest isn’t good enough, or the connection between the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>means</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ends</i> isn’t good enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s say the government wants to stop unsafe driving.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People who are legally blind do not fit the
definition of safe drivers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
government only banned legally blind people from driving, that would be
“woefully” under-inclusive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you want
to go after unsafe drivers, picking out blind drivers in particular is
unfair.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why not go after drunk drivers?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why not go after speeding drivers?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As an example of over-inclusiveness, what if the government
passed a law saying that no one over the age of 80 can drive?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This might be over-inclusive, because unsafe
drivers only form some proposition of older drivers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not all older drivers are unsafe!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So targeting <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all</i> old people and saying they can’t drive just because you are
concerned about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i> of them who are
unsafe represents a case of over-inclusiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also have laws that are under- <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and</i> over-inclusive <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at the
same time</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What if the regulated category is “people driving over the
speed limit”?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You might get some <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>safe </i>drivers going over the speed limit
(e.g. at 66 mph), plus you might <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>miss</i>
some <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unsafe </i>drivers who are going <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>under</i> the speed limit (e.g. swerving
wildly between lanes at 45 mph or crawling at 5 mph in the middle of the highway).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In reality, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>most laws</i>
are over-inclusive <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
under-inclusive to some extent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
government will always regulate with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some
degree of imperfection</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How good is the fit between the group actually regulated and
the group meant to be regulated?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
fit is “pretty good”, the law in question is more likely to be upheld.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley thinks that <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Korematsu</i></span> is an example of a
“loose fit”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Strict scrutiny normally
requires an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extremely tight fit</i> to
pass muster under the Equal Protection Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In that case, the group the government <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead, the government <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there were many people who were disloyal
to the country in World War II, but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>weren’t</i>
Japanese-Americans.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That particular law
was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>somewhat</i> under-inclusive, but <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hugely</i> over-inclusive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No fit” is an extreme where there is no connection at all
between the categories.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The purest way
to understand the rational basis test is that the case the government would
lose would be in this case of “no fit at all”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that virtually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all

Transit Authority v. <span class=SpellE>Beazer</span> </i>– Let’s use the
methodologies of over- and under-inclusiveness to evaluate the claims in this
case.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the equal protection claim against the Transit
Authority?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is the discrimination
that allegedly violates the Equal Protection Clause?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They say that it’s not fair to bar methadone
users from working for them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The rule
doesn’t label people as methadone users who do or don’t pose a risk.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It treats all methadone users, and all users
of narcotics the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How is this rule over-inclusive?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It includes methadone users who pose no
safety threat at all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s the
point.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Within the category of methadone
users, there will be some safe employees and some unsafe employees.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The considerations motivating the Transit
Authority seems different depending on just what kind of jobs their workers are
going to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How is this rule under-inclusive?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Transit Authority is trying to prevent
unsafe workers from harming the public.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But there might be other kinds of people other than narcotics users who
might not be fit to operate trains and buses safely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Methadone users are recovering drug addicts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re a stable methadone user, you’re
coping with a prior heroin addiction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
is stipulated that after a year of methadone treatment, you’re at no more risk
of relapse than the general public.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, there will be other people subject to employment by the Transit
Authority who could be considered a safety risk.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, how about alcoholics?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The rule doesn’t apply to them, and there’s
no separate rule that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does </i>apply to
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This combination of over- and under-inclusiveness shows that
there really is discrimination!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But is
it wrongful?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a mismatch between
the rule adopted and the government’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>professed</i>
safety concerns.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a bad fit between
the ends and the means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why isn’t this discrimination unconstitutional?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court says that the rational basis test
applies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Constitution doesn’t mention strict scrutiny!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Constitution doesn’t mention the rational
basis test!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Constitution doesn’t
even mention race or gender!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So where do
we get our categories?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is the Court just
doing this by fiat?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the reasoning
behind forming up these categories and lining them up the way they are?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court makes the distinction between
immutable characteristic versus things that you can change within your
lifetime.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These characteristics can be
things you’re born with or things you’ve acquired but can no longer change.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But does a rule that prevents blind people
from getting drivers’ licenses or pilots’ licenses require strict scrutiny,
since blindness is an immutable characteristic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The thing about race is that it’s not just an immutable
characteristic, but something that the courts have generally found to be a
wrongful basis for discrimination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
the Court’s judgment, on the other hand, discrimination with respect to
disability (for example), is not as frequently motivated by prejudice as is
racial discrimination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the most difficult things to grapple with when it
comes to the Equal Protection Clause and its case law is just how amorphous the
standard is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are just a few words
in the Constitution that historically have been interpreted as the Court has
seen fit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Consider the opposite
conclusion in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brown v. Board of Education</i>
as opposed to <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plessy</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Ferguson</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both cases were decided on the exact same
Equal Protection Clause!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is quite
possible that the Supreme Court may, in the future, change its understanding of
equal protection in many different ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “boxes” we have talked about have changed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not long ago, the Court thought that gender
discrimination only deserved the rational basis test.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, the Court places gender discrimination
in at least the “medium scrutiny” box.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why does the Transit Authority treat recovering narcotic
addicts differently than, for example, recovering alcoholics?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Isn’t this clearly discrimination?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can distinguish: using heroin is illegal,
while using alcohol isn’t for adults.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court doesn’t see this discrimination as improper
prejudice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, they do not
require anything higher than the rational basis test.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court in this case says that this may be wrong, but
we’re not the ones to stop it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
society thinks it’s wrong to treat methadone users differently from recovering
alcoholics, then new laws should be passed to change the system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider the claim of discrimination against opticians in <st1:State><st1:place>Oklahoma</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court decided that this is more or less a
political question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As long as there is
a plausible health and safety question, the discrimination can go on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why is the court saying that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>these</i> are the kinds of discrimination that we will not use our
judicial power to overrule?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Equal Protection Clause only applies when the government
is discriminating.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, in the voting
rights cases, the discrimination is among individuals with respect to voting
rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “Fundamental Rights” or “Fundamental Interests” strand
of equal protection jurisprudence has to do with individual rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we study substantive due process, we’ll compare it to
equal protection.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The question there
isn’t about equality of treatment, but rather of an expressly individual right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We now know that the rational basis test is going to
apply.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But how can his rule that is just
a misfit survive even under the lower level or rational basis review?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All the Transit Authority has to say is that
there is a slight safety risk in allowing methadone users to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If there is litigation under the rational basis test, the
government must defend what it’s doing under that test.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It must explain some connection, even if it
is a loose connection.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They can make up
the policy after the fact and get the benefit of the doubt!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Rational Basis Test requires the court to
show <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extreme deference</i> to the
legislature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before the <st1:place>Roosevelt</st1:place> era, the Court
was using the Equal Protection Clause to protect big business and to
micromanage American economic policy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As
part of the revolution of the New Deal, the Court said it would bend over
backwards to uphold laws that further policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From time to time, lower courts will mess this up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not every episode of governmental
discrimination violates the Equal Protection Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don’t care very much about, for example,
different taxes on slot machines on riverboats versus slot machines at
racetracks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What if we knew there was an upcoming terrorist attack
involving men of a particular ethnic group on planes?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would it be constitutional under the Equal
Protection Clause for the government to conduct special surveillance procedures
with respect to people of a particular ethnic group?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is this facial discrimination?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If this is a policy, that’s facial
discrimination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does this policy, on its
face, authorize conduct with a discriminatory motive?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court should apply strict scrutiny because this is
discrimination based on race, religion, or national origin.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the next step?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We need to look at the government’s asserted
reason for engaging in this discrimination to see if it’s a compelling
reason.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is certainly some degree
of over-inclusion or under-inclusion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Padilla was not of the same ethnic background as al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s under-inclusive.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So picking out Arab-Americans at the airport
will be over-inclusive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But is this <i

necessity that the government asserts?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are some follow-ups to do in terms of race
discrimination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don’t need to have
detailed knowledge of the reading.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
don’t need cases memorized or anything like that.</p>

the question!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How can anyone ever know
just what is a compelling interest?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Constitution says nothing about this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

rise to the level of “compelling”?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe
it’s different if it’s international terrorism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How could we possibly know what the right answer to this

the question!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How can anyone ever know
just what is a compelling interest?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Constitution says nothing about this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Equal Protection Clause has no tools to tell us what counts as a
compelling interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do you know
when you’ve crossed the line from “important” to “compelling”?<span

“out there”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court sometimes lowers the level of scrutiny in a

Which is older: VMI or the Equal Protection Clause?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>VMI actually predated the Equal Protection
Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Equal Protection Clause came
after the Civil War.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>VMI came before the
Civil War.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the folks in Congress
wrote the Fourteenth Amendment and sent it to the states for ratification.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>
originally refused to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, but they were coerced
into doing so by making it a precondition for getting back into the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So let’s say it’s 1875 or so and the same
lawsuit is broad as in this case, challenging the legitimacy of VMI as a
male-only institution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that time,
what would have happened?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would have
most certainly been dismissed!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court has adopted intermediate scrutiny for gender
discrimination in part because race discrimination, for which there is strict
scrutiny, was more on the mind of the drafters of the Fourteenth
Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if the drafters of the
Fourteenth Amendment didn’t even think they were addressing gender
discrimination, why should gender discrimination get elevated scrutiny at
all?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There have certainly been social
changes between then and now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How could the level of scrutiny change under the Fourteenth
Amendment?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Fourteenth Amendment
hasn’t been <span class=SpellE>reratified</span> or readopted since 1868.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can this be understood in terms of
legality?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a proposal to
amendment the Constitution with the Equal Rights Amendment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We felt that the Constitution didn’t provide
for gender equality.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many felt that the
Nineteenth Amendment didn’t go far enough.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But the ERA didn’t get ratified, and even had opposition from
women.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So how can the Court justify its
result in finding that the Equal Protection Clause is different in 1976 than in
1868?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Constitution isn’t necessarily
perfect, and there may be a lot that we don’t personally like about it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But legality says that we abide by it
anyway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just who should be allowed to
say what the Constitution is?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe we could say that the Court can say what the Equal
Protection Clause means until the people choose to amend it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What did the Equal Protection Clause mean
originally?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some historical evidence
suggests that it was limited to certain basic rights like the right to make
contracts or be a witness in a trial or to own property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arguably, the people who wrote the Fourteenth Amendment
thought that discrimination on any basis with regard to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>those particular civil rights</i> would violate the amendment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But did they understand the Fourteenth
Amendment to affect the existence of VMI, or the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>Virginia</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> (which was all-male at
the time)?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the Equal Protection
Clause meant one thing when it was adopted and means something different now,
then when did its meaning change, and by what legal process did its meaning change?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does Congress have the power to say that there may not be
any single-sex colleges in <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If so, why should the Court be able to usurp
that power?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Isn’t Congress much more
able to respond to social change?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Court is just supposed to enforce the law as it exists.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Arguably, you can’t enforce rights that
aren’t there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is the significance of legislation being proposed in
Congress but failing to be adopted?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Are
there some proposals that are so great that their failure is evidence of a flaw
in the system?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or do we totally trust
the system?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If everyone in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> agreed to what the laws should be,
there would be no reason for debate at all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Maybe the country wasn’t ready for a national gender policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is there a disconnect between Constitutional Law and social
policy?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here are two questions: (1) How
do we figure out the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Equal
Protection Clause given that it was adopted in 1868 and it hasn’t been changed
or amended since?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can its meaning
transform over time (c.f. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brown v. Board
of Education</i>)?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) How can we
understand these changes and know when they have occurred?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is it wholly up to the Supreme Court to
decide when these changes will occur?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or
is the Supreme Court not the agent of change but rather a reflection of social
change?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if we accept the idea that the meaning of the
Fourteenth Amendment changes over time, we’ll have to figure out just what it
means.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say the VMI case is correctly
decided.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we take it as a given, we
need to figure out whether single-sex classroom options in K-12 are allowed
under the holding of VMI.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We take
certain things as given.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example,
segregation on the basis of race is presumptively unconstitutional.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Perhaps segregation on the basis of gender
should be presumptively unconstitutional too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But maybe there are acceptable forms of gender
discrimination: we have separate men’s and women’s sports.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We tolerate separate but equal in this area
under Title IX.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we can’t have
separate teams based on race.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The big fear at the time of the ERA was that it would
supposedly eliminate single-sex bathrooms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We actually did formerly have single-race bathrooms in the South.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So bathrooms were on people’s minds in the
1970s, according to Foley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then how do we understand the relationship of social
transformation to legal transformation?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We don’t know yet, but I guess we will tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two things: What about gay marriage?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the status under the Fourteenth
Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of laws like the Ohio DOMA?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a HOT TOPIC!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the text of the Equal Protection Clause
say anything about gay marriage?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
text of the Constitution doesn’t resolve this question, where should a judge
look?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Should the judge look at original
intent?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about the fact that
statutes against interracial marriage are now unconstitutional?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does that change the meaning or understanding
of the Equal Protection Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
Court can abandon original intent with respect to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>some </i>issues, then why can’t the Court abandon original intent with
respect to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other</i> issues, like gay
marriage?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second: People who believe that the Court should not be
guided by narrowly understood original intent argue that you shouldn’t look to
what the authors of the Fourteenth Amendment thought about any <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>specific </i>problem.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead, you should look to the fact that the
drafters wanted to add a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general
principle</i> to the Constitution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
there is a gap between contemporary understanding of that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>general</i> idea and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>original</i>
and specific understanding of the idea, the Court should adopt the general
principle.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Recall that at the time of
the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the galleries in Congress were
segregated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is clear that the authors
of the Fourteenth Amendment didn’t mean to render segregation
unconstitutional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But maybe they <span
class=SpellE>misdrafted</span> the amendment in some sense and did more than
they specifically intended to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the Court has one conception of the general idea but it
is at odds with what a large segment of the people believe, then what should
the Court do?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Should the Court follow
its own understanding of equality and equal protection, or should it be guided
by the views of the American people in general?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does the Court apply intermediate scrutiny in this
case?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is it that <st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>
loses under intermediate scrutiny?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why
is <st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State> incapable of
justifying the existence of VMI under this test?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State> tries
to argue that VMI is just one school of many, and there are lots of other
schools that aren’t single-sex.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
want to say that it would support diversity to have one school that isn’t coed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why does the Court feel that this diversity
interest doesn’t work to argue for the existence of VMI?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is the existence of VMI an inappropriate
means of advancing the interest of diversity?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why doesn’t VMI further diversity?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>VMI is a male-only institution.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t allow women.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say you’re a woman and you want to go to
VMI.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s no other place that you
could go!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court says that this is
male preference, not diversity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>
also set up a female counterpart to VMI at Mary Baldwin, and the Court found
that it wasn’t close enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lesson of this case is that the Court is extremely
suspicious of any attempt to respond to a history of segregation with a
creation of an alternative rather than integration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nguyen v. Immigration
and Naturalization Service</i> – This was a closely divided decision, 5-4.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Basically, this case involved a rule that if
you’re born overseas and your mother is an American citizen, then the child
gets American citizenship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if the father
is an American citizen, it’s not automatic.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is facial gender discrimination in the law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s argued that paternity can be
proved.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the majority finds that the
law isn’t meant to be exclusionary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To the
majority, the law didn’t have the same feel as the law in the VMI case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court gives the federal government more

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a proposed home for the mentally retarded in the
city.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The city required a special permit
to have such a home in this particular neighborhood.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The city doesn’t want that home there, and
they invoke a certain city ordinance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How does this case get to the Supreme Court?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the federal constitutional issue?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The key point of an equal protection analysis
is to find the alleged discrimination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
is a special permit required for a home for the mentally retarded, but not for
certain other groups.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like what?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, the same house could be used for a frat
or sorority or nursing home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could
have a lot of stuff there, but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>
mentally retarded people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is the basic holding of the Court with respect to this
claim?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They decide that the mentally
retarded shouldn’t be a quasi-suspect classification, however, they find that
in this case in particular the denial of the permit doesn’t have a rational
basis and thus is unconstitutional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two parts to the inquiry: (1) What level of
scrutiny applies?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court doesn’t
apply strict scrutiny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court only
applies the rational basis test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) In
this particular case, the discrimination is no good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The language of suspect and quasi-suspect classification is
a pet peeve of Foley.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>classification in the law</i> that is
considered suspicious or suspect when you have heightened or intermediate
scrutiny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’re not saying that mentally
retarded people are “suspect”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s sort
of an inelegant, colloquial shorthand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For Foley’s purposes, don’t use the term “suspect class”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Use the term “suspect classification”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cleburne</i></st1:place></st1:City>
came out when Foley was in law school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This case seems to get bigger and bigger over time in terms of setting
out the basic framework for how the Supreme Court thinks about equal
protection: when it’s going to use heightened scrutiny or not, and how it
applies low-level scrutiny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Interestingly, this law <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>flunks</i>
the rational basis test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So this is an
important case, though not the last word on equal protection.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a biggie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s look at the part of the holding where they say that
they aren’t going to apply heightened scrutiny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why not?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the opposite of
what the Fifth Circuit decided.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Brennan,
Marshall, and <span class=SpellE>Blackmun</span> would have applied
intermediate scrutiny for laws that treat the mentally retarded differently
from others.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is the Court’s
reasoning?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They say that mentally retarded people <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>really are</i> different from other people so that there is a rational
reason for treating them differently in the law, at least from time to
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Compare their situation to blind
people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Historically, some laws that
have treated the mentally retarded differently have been based on prejudice,
but not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> such laws have been
bad.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>most</i> laws that regulate on the basis of
race or gender have had an invidious character.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why not treat mental retardation laws the same as gender discrimination
laws as opposed to like laws discriminating between opticians and
optometrists?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court says that the
legislation over time related to the mentally retarded tried to protect them
rather than hurt them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court is
concerned that to impose heightened review would discourage legislation that
would benefit the mentally retarded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court will start with the presumption that these laws
are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valid</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two more points that the Court made.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court says that the mentally retarded are
adequately represented politically.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Court seems to care about the political dynamic here.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whether a group has political power in the
legislature is a factor for the Court in deciding whether judicial intervention
is necessary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court doesn’t claim
that the mentally retarded will be able to exercise power by voting or being in
the legislature, but there is a sense that people who are not retarded will
take care of their “less fortunate” neighbors and fellow citizens.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is sort of a “paternalistic” attitude:
we can count on ordinary citizens and legislators to act with good will
concerns mental retardation issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court also says that if you must subject laws related to
mental retardation to higher scrutiny, they claim you’ll have to bring in lots
of other classifications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does <st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
  normal'>Cleburne</i></st1:place></st1:City> tell us when a new form of
intermediate scrutiny might arise?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are certain state areas where more deference is given
to the states or other institutions, like in prisons or in a military context.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The whole other part of this case: we know the rational
basis test applies, but the law flunks the test?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How come?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Normally, most laws <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>don’t flunk</i>
the rational basis test after the New Deal revolution of 1937.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The rational basis test is kind of a way to
bend over backwards to support the government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How did the city try to justify the denial of the
permit?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They try to claim that other
citizens are afraid of the mentally retarded.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court says no way!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can’t
relegate a whole class of people to a certain area just because people don’t
like them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>illegitimate reason</i> under the Equal
Protection Clause!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s exactly what
the Equal Protection Clause is designed to quash!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have to evaluate both the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ends</i> and the relationship of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>means</i> to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ends</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this goal is
terrible in itself!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s prejudice!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The city’s lawyers said that it was a problem that the home
was across from a junior high school and they thought the students would harass
the mentally retarded persons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court
says that’s not legitimate either!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
school across the street has 30 mentally retarded students itself!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It also smacks of bigotry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the junior high kids are mean, that’s ill
will, and the government can’t discriminate on the basis of the ill will of its
own citizens.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Imagine if we were talking
about race instead of mental retardation!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If one group is really mean to another, you have to crack down on the
mean people!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The city’s lawyers said that the home was on a floodplain,
and they were concerned about the residents in the case of a flood.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a 500 year floodplain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means the statistical chance is that a
flood will tend to occur once every 500 years!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s a very slim explanation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Very, very slim.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is this an
invalid justification under the rational basis test?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not really; it’s valid, but it’s not
rationally related.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The floodplain
argument, as silly as it is, flunks for a different reason.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a safety-related reason, not based on
hatred or irrational prejudice in the way the first two are.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the goal is remotely legitimate, why are
the means no good?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The means are no good
because the ordinance at issue allows nursing homes, convalescent homes,
hospitals, and so on at the same location.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The city supposedly thinks that old people or sick people would have no
problem getting away from a flood while the mentally retarded would.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court says that to differentiate between
the retarded and other folks who suffer from the same sorts of conditions, it
is irrational!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last point that the city made was to say that they were
worried about how many people live in one house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court said that you could have an
across-the-board rule, or zone for single-family dwellings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But instead, this city allows stuff like
fraternities and sororities, so it’s obviously not concerned about just the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>numbers </i>of people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We talked yesterday about the way that the Court, in
rejecting the “floodplain” defense of the ordinance, said that this may be a
legitimate interest, but the regulation is not plausibly related to the
interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they had given <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>super </i>deference, they may have come to a
different conclusion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some people think
that the rational basis test here was “rational basis plus” or “rational basis
with bite” or “rational basis with teeth”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How minimal is the requirement of the rational basis test?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does there just need to be a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quantum</i> of overlap between the ends and
means?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or does there have to be some
kind of minimum fit?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Justice Stevens gives us the “sliding scale” idea.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He doesn’t want to think about three boxes
(strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He wants a range of deference.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the Court doesn’t embrace the Stevens
approach, and claims that it is applying the traditional rational basis
approach.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The best understanding is that
we have a “turbocharged” version of the rational basis review, but we don’t
know when the Court will apply this version as opposed to the regular version.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How would the precedents of <st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cleburne</i></st1:place></st1:City> and <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Beazer</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>apply to different fact patterns?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Beazer</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>plaintiffs
might succeed in terms of housing, and the <st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cleburne</i></st1:place></st1:City>
plaintiffs might fail with respect to jobs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The major point here is: the judgments that underlie
speculations about job discrimination with respect to the mentally retarded
would be upheld, while housing discrimination against recovering drug addicts
would <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> be upheld.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The difference in judgment is based on the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>facts</i> and on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>policy</i>, not from the Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Think about the factual differences between cases to try to
distinguish them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s more important to
be able to argue both sides of cases than to actually come to a conclusion.</p>

</span>The plaintiffs claim that <span class=SpellE>Grutter</span> was denied
admission to the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Law</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
because of her race.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How does that
relate to the Constitution?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What makes
denial to law school based on race a problem based on the Constitution?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She claims it violates the Equal Protection Clause
to make race a predominant or outcome-determinative factor in whether someone
gets admitted or not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we know that race was a factor in whether she was
denied admission?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We clearly have facial
discrimination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Race is taken into account
in admissions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But diversity could be
based on things other than race.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
role does racial and ethnic diversity play in <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>’s
definition of their policy?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a
remedial function.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some groups were
considered to have suffered discrimination, and thus they should be helped out
as a form of compensation or remediation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They single out Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic
Americans.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Be precise in your
language.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Different people were said to
bring different ideas to class discussion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
and the Supreme Court see the beneficiaries of this policy as not merely the
minority students, but all students.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Justice Thomas objects that the policy is designed to benefit mostly
Caucasians and Asians and that the individuals who are admitted because of
special consideration actually suffer a sort of stigma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Are there any other reasons to justify these affirmative
action programs besides the classroom learning environment?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court also considers that fact that the
business community and the military support affirmative action.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why did the business community submit the
amicus brief that they did?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They said
that we live in an increasingly multicultural society, and so to be
well-educated, you must be exposed to diversity. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>So we want a good experience in the classroom,
and we want students prepared for diversity outside the classroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about the military?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s very important, but it’s a little different than what the
businesses say.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the national
security deal?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The military says that we
need a diverse officer corps for national security.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The military argues that there is racial
diversity in the world’s hotspots.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
brief that was filed by the former military officers is one of the most
significant and powerful amicus briefs ever filed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
there was a lot of race tension because there were more minorities in the lower
ranks and more majority people in the higher ranks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The military decided that you must have an
officer corps that is representative of the nation as a whole.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The racial composition of the officer corps
cannot differ too greatly from that of the troops.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court makes the point of legitimacy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority talks about the idea of the
legitimacy of our government depending on leadership positions being open to
all regardless of racial background.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How
is this argument different than the “classroom diversity” argument?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yesterday, we talked about the law schools’ interest in
having a diverse student body, both in terms of classroom diversity and the
workplace diversity that is thought to follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also discussed the interest of the legitimacy the
government.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is claimed that minority
groups won’t see the government as legitimate if they feel like the paths to
power aren’t open to them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We talked
about this in the context of the amicus brief from former military
officers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It could apply just as well to
other institutions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The notion here is
that the minority communities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
won’t trust the government if it doesn’t include minorities.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This helps explain why the Court feels that
the state’s interest is compelling in this case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They seem to feel that the whole stability of
the government is at stake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court
feels that we cannot survive as a society unless we make legal education
available to everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That’s the first part of the analysis.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s the university’s position, and the
Court embraces it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next, the second part
of the analysis: if we accept that diversity is a compelling state interest,
why, in the university’s view, is it necessary that the law school use the
admissions policy that it did in order to achieve diversity?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was making race a factor in admissions
decisions the best way to do it?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why
does the law school believe itself of being incapable of obtaining a diverse
student body if it doesn’t make race a factor in admissions?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The university claims that if they didn’t take race into
account, they wouldn’t otherwise get enough people from the various minority
groups to form a “critical mass”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nobody
contests that factually.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the law
school relied only on grades and LSAT scores, then they wouldn’t achieve
“critical mass” or sufficient diversity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The record disclosed that if the law school relied solely on the
numbers, minority representation would be only 4% of the student population
rather than 12-20%.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why not abandon
using the number altogether?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t
want to abandon their elitism, apparently.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They want to be prestigious and selective.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How does that relate to the compelling state
interest?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is part of the dissent’s
argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if they used a lottery
system?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then you would have a student
body that is representative of the people trying to get admitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the university’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>top</i>
priority was diversity, they could have open enrollment or a lottery.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But they have a higher priority on being an
elite law school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court seems to
tell us that the school is allowed to posit these “twin goals” simultaneously.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>just</i> want diversity, they want to have their cake and eat it
too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only way to do both, they
claim, is to use race as an admissions factor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>combination </i>of the two
goals requires and justifies the use of race as an admissions factor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beyond asserting that it wants to be a selective, elite law
school, what underlying policy goal or social need does the law school assert
to justify its selectivity as arising to the level of a compelling state
interest?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t really give
one!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a good point made by
Justice Thomas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority seems to
say that the law school can’t achieve both of its goals at the same time
without making race a factor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
majority credits this as vital, but doesn’t explain why.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don’t really know why it is such a
compelling interest to have an elite law school as a state law school.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They seem to say that there must be open
access to elite law schools because those law schools are the paths to power in
this country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But even if <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
didn’t have an elite law school, there would still be elite law schools that
are private and thus not bound by the Equal Protection Clause (like Harvard,
Yale, and Stanford).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there’s also
part of the Civil Rights Act that tracks the requirements of the Equal
Protection Clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it were
unconstitutional for <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State> to
do what it did, it would be illegal by statute under Title VI for Harvard to do
what <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>it</i> did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court seems to say that <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
wants to pursue two goals.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it isn’t
explained why <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State> has these
two goals.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems to be based on the
notion that we will have highly selective law schools in American society, and
some of them will be public schools and we need to make sure that there is open
access to them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s stipulate that
strict scrutiny applies in this case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Ginsburg believes that you shouldn’t have strict scrutiny in an
affirmative action context, but that’s not the view of the majority.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But under any level of scrutiny, you must
look at (1) the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>goal</i>, and (2) the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>means</i> and its relationship to the
goal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The use of race as an admissions
factor would not be justified based on either of those goals <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>alone</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If the university only wanted to consider diversity, they wouldn’t need
to consider race, and if the university only wanted to have selective
admissions, they wouldn’t need to consider race either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Diversity is a laudable goal, but you don’t need to make
race a factor in order to have diversity, because you could have a lottery
instead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s only the intersection of
the goals of diversity and selectivity that justifies the consideration of race
in admissions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But even taking these two
goals as compelling, why is it necessary for <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
to use racial background as an admissions factor to achieve those goals?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are lots of “soft variables” that have
nothing to do with race that would not be considered under strict
scrutiny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could look at leadership
potential, for example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The argument was made by the plaintiff that you don’t have
to consider race as an admissions factor at all for any applicant and maintain
selectivity if you use “soft factors” in a sophisticated way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is argued that you can achieve all the
goals that you want to as long as you don’t rely on actual skin color.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>Michigan</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> asserted that it could
not achieve its twin goals without using race the way it did.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the plaintiffs never presented an
evidentiary case to challenge this assertion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The main strategy of the plaintiffs was to dispute diversity as a
compelling goal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They hoped that a
majority of the Court would reject the contention that diversity could count as
a compelling interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then their second
line of attack would be to show by statistics that the way race was used here
was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tantamount</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>to </i>a quota and too rigid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But they didn’t take on the other point: assuming the law school is not
operating a quota system, but rather a system of “soft factors”, is race a
necessary one of those factors?</p>

was first litigated, that was the scenario that <span class=SpellE>Boalt</span>
Hall was operating on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, somehow
it turns out that in the last couple of years, <span class=SpellE>Boalt</span>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gratz</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Bollinger</i> – The holding is pretty
clear: the undergraduate program at <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
had a different method for admitting students.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are a lot of complex fact, but basically the admissions program
evolved into a “20 point plus” plan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
you’re a member of one of the three underrepresented minority groups, then you
get a bonus.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The holding of the case is
that the fixed assignment of 20 points for being of a certain racial background
is unconstitutional, even in the context of a plan that assigns points for many
other soft factors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Interestingly, the
university offers the same justification as the law school did.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They assert a diversity interest and a
selectivity interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority
opinion in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gratz</i></span>
doesn’t dispute that these interests are compelling, as admitted in <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Grutter</i></span>, but the
20 point plus factor approach is not narrowly tailored enough to achieve these
compelling interests.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justice O’Connor
writes a concurrence which is the most important one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It helps you line up <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Grutter</i></span> and <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gratz</i></span> and how what the law school
was doing was permissible but what the undergraduate school was doing was not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the justifications that the undergraduate school
supplied was administrative necessity: the undergraduate college got so many
applications and it was such a large school relative to the law school that it
couldn’t do the kind of file-by-file review that the law school was doing, but
instead had to adopt a more structured approach to undergraduate admissions, and
therefore it made sense to come up with specified point factors for all of
these “soft” considerations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They argued
that they were doing the same thing the law school was doing, but had to use
the point system out of necessity because of the volume of their
applications.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court rejects this
claim of necessity: this administrative necessity is not a compelling interest
in itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It doesn’t count as narrowly
tailored.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court tells the
undergraduate program that they must adopt something like what the law school
was doing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the case came out, the
university announced that they would hire many more undergraduate admissions
officers so they could process applications file-by-file.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their argument turned out to be more about
money: it would just cost more to look at applications file-by-file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we understand the constitutional distinction that the
Court here is adopting between what is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>impermissible</i>
(the 20 extra points) and on the other hand, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>permissibility</i> of the individualized file-by-file review in <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Grutter</i></span>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The law school asserts that what it’s looking
for in the context of individualized review is “critical mass”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The minority argued that “critical mass”
converted the purported file-by-file review into effectively a quota system.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court rejects that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The assignment of 20 points is obviously
different from what occurred in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Bakke</i></span>, which was a set aside for minority medical students,
and the holding in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bakke</i></span>
was that you can’t have that set aside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gratz</i></span>,
you don’t have that set-aside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>20 points
may or may not be enough to get you admitted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you scored more, or got a higher score from other factors, you would
get admitted over a minority applicant who got 20 points but didn’t get a
greater number of points than the other applicant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
argued that it was consistent with <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Bakke</i></span> that they didn’t have a set-aside because all
applicants were completing against each other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court says that’s no good, that’s unconstitutional, but the goal of
seeking “critical mass” is permissible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20 points for all minority members does not differentiate
among the diversity <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>within </i>those
groups.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe some African Americans
grow up in suburbia and some grow up in the inner city.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe some of them have parents who are
doctors or lawyers, and others have parents who didn’t go to college.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>O’Connor is concerned about how
insufficiently attentive this system is to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>true</i>
diversity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Socioeconomic diversity and
racial diversity aren’t the same <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>kind</i>
of diversity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But then to look at the same question from a different
angle, Justice Powell in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bakke</i></span>
did not use the term “critical mass”, and the Harvard plan did not use that
term.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiffs in <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Grutter</i></span> say that
when the law school searches for “critical mass”, they’re not using race as a
“tiebreaker”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Critical mass” seems to
be different: from the beginning of the admissions process, you’re looking to
make sure that the entering class has a certain proportion of entering students
of a certain background.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is some
notion of sufficiency.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiffs
say this is a quota.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the Court in <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Grutter</i></span> rejects
that argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There has been variation
from 12% to 20% in minority backgrounds at <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This range is inconsistent with a quota,
according to the Court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s not enough that you have a compelling interest
here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems that it’s essential to
the success of the law school’s claim in this case that it’s open to the
possibility year to year that they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fail</i>
to reach “critical mass”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s the
difference between a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quota</i> and a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>goal</i>, or a quota and a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>target</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Race cannot be outcome-determinative regardless of other
considerations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justice O’Connor thus
ties the idea of fluctuation to flexibility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Fluctuation, in her mind, is a product of a process that is sufficiently
flexible so race is never entitled to be mechanically or rigidly
outcome-determinative.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’ll look at
race as one factor, but if it turns out in our applicant pool in a given year
that we’re not able to achieve “critical mass”, then we don’t, and we don’t let
that factor override all other factors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may all have views on this stuff, but ultimately we need
to know what the Court thinks about the issues so we can represent clients in
Court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, are the <span
class=SpellE>LSATs</span> inherently racist?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But on the other hand, will the current U.S. Supreme Court pay attention
to this?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Probably not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lawyers from <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
did a good job, it seems.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They got five
votes for the law school program.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
wasn’t obvious beforehand that the votes would be there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We knew O’Connor would cast the swing vote,
but we didn’t know which way it would go.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In this part of the class, much more so than with the Commerce Clause or
executive privilege, figuring out the line between a policy argument and a
legal argument is really tricky and not clear-cut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the issues that we talked about <span class=GramE>yesterday,</span>
and one of the issues that’s lurking in this case is whether we can trust <span
class=SpellE>Boalt</span> Hall and <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
to be honest about what they’re doing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We’d like to think we can trust them because they are law schools and
law professors, but we should put that on the table.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority opinion’s only response is the
deference that is given to the university as a university, where the university
tells us that they are looking at these reports in no rigid way and they don’t
change what they’re doing based on the use of the reports.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s not convincing to the dissenters, but
that’s what the majority says.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cleburne</i></st1:place></st1:City>
was an example of “rational basis with bite”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In this case, it seems like they’re applying a more relaxed version of
strict scrutiny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is debatable whether
this scrutiny is as strict as it was in other cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about this 25-year sunset thing?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It may be an effort to narrow the ruling in a
particular way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems to be
O’Connor’s view that even considering diversity is a compelling interest
because it goes to the legitimacy of our <span class=GramE>government,</span>
she seems to say that it has a time limit on it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The use of race cannot be unlimited and
open-ended, not withstanding the necessity of the government being legitimate
to its citizens.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You would think it
would be imperative to have diversity and the means to achieve it no matter
what!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>25 years is like a generation.<span

procedures first, and then the substance of the proceedings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They built up 30 years of precedent to get
the Court comfortable enough to issue <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Lochner</i></span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there
was a lot of history that preceded <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Lochner</i></span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They had
been doing a “fuzzy” version of substantive due process for some years before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking of the Due Process Clause, we have a separate
clause in Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution which prohibits states from
enacting laws that impairs the obligations of contracts (the “Contracts
Clause”).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why didn’t the Court rely on
this Clause to come to their conclusion in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It turns out that the actual Contracts Clause
only applies to contracts that were previously entered into.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(But, I wonder…how can we have bankruptcy
laws?)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In any case, that’s not what was
going on in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>
because the prohibition was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>forward-looking</i>:
you can’t enter into a bargain for 61 hours per week <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ever</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s why they
couldn’t use this in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What were <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>’s
reasons for enacting this law in the first place?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How can we argue that the law shouldn’t be
unconstitutional in the first place?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> made a public health argument: they argued that
they needed to limit bakers’ working hours to protect bread consumers from
unhealthy bread.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to look at
every argument put forth by both sides!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Parse out all the asserted reasons the government gives that the law
should survive constitutional scrutiny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The second health reason was the health of the baker themselves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They put forth evidence to suggest that the
dust from the flour causes lung disease and other ailments of the workers
themselves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why did the Court reject
that argument?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court said that in
the case of mine workers, it makes sense that coal dust and other dangers
constitute serious, pressing, and obvious safety concerns for the workers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In that case, the Court would let the
government interfere with liberty of contract under a strict scrutiny
analysis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the Court finds a bakery
too “run of the mill” to be interfered with.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court finds that the <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
law is too “paternalistic”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>
deals with sweatshops!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some people think
that law firms are like sweatshops.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
if the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> passed a law
that capped the number of hours that a law firm could hire an associate
for?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People could disagree about whether
that’s good policy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Should the Court get
involved with this policy debate?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Holmes
argued that this is exactly what the Court was doing and that they shouldn’t
get involved in the legislative process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>

</span>So why do we still need to study it today?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We need to look at the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>method</i> the Court uses in reaching its decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What other interest did the state of <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> assert to justify the law?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is an early labor law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is an era of industrialization and big
corporations of the time had a lot of clout and power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Teddy Roosevelt came into office as a
“trust-buster”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was also an era of
unionization among workers, especially in unskilled occupations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The state of <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
said that working in a bakery is an industry with a disparity of bargaining
power such that the employer has much more bargaining power than the
employee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, they argued, the freedom
of bargaining power was somewhat illusory.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They basically believed that Adam Smith didn’t apply to the modern
industrial economy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So they attempted to
justify the law as a labor law enhancing the economic bargaining power of the
workers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the Court said that the first two purposes were
plausible, but the means of pursuing them were not narrowly tailored
enough.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With respect to labor law, the
Court said that it was not a legitimate purpose!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The “labor law” goal of trying to level the
playing field between employers and employees was called antithetical to the
liberty of contract!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court says that
the labor law justification fails at the “goal” level.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Holmes was famous for saying that labor laws
are per se invalid and that the Constitution protects capitalism as such.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Holmes though that the economic system was to
be determined by the legislature.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Holmes’s dissent was sort of on a more “philosophical” level.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Williamson</i>
all about?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court upheld an <st1:State><st1:place>Oklahoma</st1:place></st1:State>
law that said opticians cannot fit lenses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In the old days, you might want to have your glasses fixed by putting
old lenses in a new frame.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You had to
get a new prescription to put old lenses in a new frame.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You had to go to the ophthalmologist or
optometrist, not the optician.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
optician could have done it just as well, though.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is an interference with the liberty of
contract too!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What was the claim under
the Due Process Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is this
substantive due process or procedural due process?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The optician isn’t complaining about a lack
of notice, for example.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’re
complaining that you shouldn’t be able to keep them from putting old lenses in
new frames, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>period</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The important thing to understand is: you can’t line these
cases up, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Williamson</i> and <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are inconsistent in terms of
reasoning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All the arguments that the
Court accepts in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>
it then rejects in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Williamson</i> in the
1950s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court has the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>opposite</i> judicial attitude, bending over
backwards to sustain a much sillier-looking law than the law in <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
law gets rejected even as a consumer health measure, this one should be
rejected too because the consumer health and safety explanation is very
slim.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court uses the standard of
being “rationally related to a legitimate purpose”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The judicial mindset is totally different
with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Williamson</i> than with <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In reality, the ophthalmologists and
optometrists had better lobbyists than the opticians!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was a way to line the pockets of the
ophthalmologists!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:Street><st1:address><span
  class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span> Court</st1:address></st1:Street>
would have definitely struck this down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first thing we read this semester was an article about
Justice O’Connor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How come?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She is the swing vote.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Constitutional Law is made by human beings
who make mistakes!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only thing you
need to know to explain the shift is the existence of the Depression and FDR’s
New Deal and court-packing plan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>FDR
thinks that laissez-faire is passé.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
wants labor laws!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He wants demand-side
economics!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want higher paychecks for workers!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to constrain the supply of labor in
order to increase the price of wages!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The basic point is that the revolution in Constitutional Law under the
Commerce Clause transformed Constitutional Law both with respect to federalism
issues, and with respect to the Due Process Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Lochner</i></span> was thrown out the window along with the presumption
for liberty of contract!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t even
talk about “paternalism”!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’ll let
democratic legislatures decide what sort of economic laws we’re going to have
without the interference of substantive due process.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Any time that someone comes into the Court
with a law that they claim violates substantive due process, the Court will
say: “We don’t want to hear about it!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The government can do it if they want!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the status of the substantive due process doctrine
today?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’ll talk about it in terms of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Roe v. Wade</i>, but what about in an economic sense?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So far, the Court hasn’t found the equivalent
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> that has reawakened <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span> the way
that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> reawakened the old-style
Commerce Clause thinking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There have
been some hints over the last decade, but nothing like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Lopez</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The most important
“hint” has been in the area of punitive damages.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In two cases, the Court has invalidated very
large punitive damages awards as excessive: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>BMW
v. Gore</i> and another one (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>State Farm</i>?).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court said that as a matter of the
Fourteenth Amendment, they were going to impose a ceiling on punitive
damages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>That sort of
looks like <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>
coming back to life.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is the
problem of excessive punitive damages a substantive problem or a procedural due
process problem of poorly-instructed juries?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s part of the debate, but we don’t need to worry about it for our
purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over the next decade, these cases may be paving the way for
a new case in the next ten years that repudiates the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

and that certain laws are too extreme.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Foley thinks that there aren’t five votes in the Court yet.<span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They really, really hate it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The New Deal has been changing in Commerce
Clause law, but it hasn’t been changing as much in substantive due process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, let’s turn to some more modern issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold v. </i><st1:State><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Connecticut</i></st1:place></st1:State> –
What is this about?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What are the facts
and what is the constitutional question?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There is a law in <st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State>
saying that you’re not allowed to use birth control.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Griswold is <span class=SpellE>Exective</span>
Director of Planned Parenthood in <st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State>
and helps couples with birth control.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The <st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State> law may be
bad, but why is it a problem under the Constitution?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is there a marital privacy clause in the
Constitution?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No way!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It doesn’t exist!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At best, the right to privacy is
implied.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>But where?</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not in the Commerce Clause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court adopts the “penumbra” concept.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Penumbra means “shadow”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court finds a right lurking the shadows
of the Bill of Rights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The right of
marital privacy is in the shadow of all the amendments collectively.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But how does that have anything to do with this
<st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State> law?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the First Amendment apply to the state
of <st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>Only to Congress.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Third Amendment doesn’t apply to <st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State>
either.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>None of the provisions of the
Bill of Rights actually directly apply to the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>So if we accept the penumbra theory as a
theory of the Bill of Rights, it would make sense to say that Congress has no
power to pass a law that outlaws birth control.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Did they even have birth control in 1787?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>James Madison would have felt that Congress
had no business getting involved in such things.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:City><st1:place>Madison</st1:place></st1:City>
would think it was a state issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We can
imagine that the Bill of Rights identifies some specific subjects that we’re
“reminding” Congress that they’re not allowed to do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe marital privacy was something that <st1:City><st1:place>Madison</st1:place></st1:City>
just forgot to include because he could never conceive of Congress interfering
in that area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But how does this affect <st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Bill of Rights only applies to the
federal government!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When James Madison sent the Bill of Rights to the states, he
sent 12 provisions, only 10 of which were adopted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The First Amendment was actually number three
on the list.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Number two on James
Madison’s list was adopted about 200 years later: the one about the
compensation of congressmen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>James
Madison’s number one amendment was a provision that said no state shall
interfere with the freedom of speech and some other rights among the Bill of
Rights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The states said that the Federal
Constitution shouldn’t tell states what they can and can’t do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They felt that those rights should be
protected by the state constitutions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The structure of what got adopted in 1791 was a list of rights that
Congress and the federal government can’t violate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whatever else the Ninth Amendment <span
class=GramE>means,</span> it only says that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Congress</i>
can’t violate <span class=SpellE>unenumerated</span> rights.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So where else can we look to force the states
to not do stuff?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the next key important point: the Bill of Rights
doesn’t touch the states by its <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>own</i>
force.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nor does the Ninth Amendment
touch the states by its own force.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Fourteenth Amendment </i>incorporates
the Bill of Rights!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Fourteenth
Amendment was designed to constrain and subjugate states!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The point is that the doctrine of substantive
due process is used to take all the important rights of the Bill of Rights and
funnel them into the Fourteenth Amendment to make them applicable against the
states.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some of the rights of the Bill of
Rights <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are</i> procedural rights.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But freedom of speech or freedom of religion
are not procedural rights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So maybe
“penumbra” parts of the Bill of Rights are incorporated through substantive due
process too!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this is substantive due
process!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only reason we can analyze
this <st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State> law against
contraception is because of the substantive due process doctrine.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no specific provision of the
Constitution that applies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a
penumbra!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There also was no “freedom of
contract” in the Due Process Clause, but <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span> incorporated that as a
“liberty”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:City><st1:place>Liberty</st1:place></st1:City>
of contraception may be different than the liberty of contract, but it seems to
be a similar form of reasoning in this case as in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does the Court decide what rights are “living in the
shadows” of the Bill of Rights?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big <span class=SpellE>big</span> </i>question
that we’ll spend our next two weeks on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What rights are worthy of protection?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The repudiation of <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Lochner</i></span> meant that the Court was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>wrong</i> in thinking that the right of contract was especially
important.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The received wisdom has been
that the Court fundamentally made a huge mistake in that respect.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court “found a right in the shadows”, and
it turned out it was wrong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the Court
is going to be finding <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>new</i> rights in
the shadows, we need to find out if the rights they find are the “right
rights”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is the scope of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does the right of marital privacy
entail?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does it mean?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’re not going to have police bust into
someone’s bedroom and search for contraceptives.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But wouldn’t that also be covered under the
Fourth Amendment?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State>
has made having birth control a crime.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Suppose that <st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State>
found out somehow that a particular married couple is in possession of condoms,
for example.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They fill out a warrant
saying that they have probable cause to believe that a crime was being
committed, namely, the possession of contraceptives.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So they get the warrant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would the execution of that warrant be an unreasonable
search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is the Court saying that this is a per se
violation of the Fourth Amendment?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
wouldn’t need to rely on the penumbra theory if the Fourth Amendment covered
this situation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the Fourth Amendment

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Glucksburg</i></span> is an important case
for addressing that methodological issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s not the only one: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lawrence v.
Texas</i> is important too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, all
three readings for the rest of this week are really setting the stage for an
extended discussion of <st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lawrence</i></st1:place></st1:City>
next week.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’re using a series of

<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bowers</i>
is important, however, it gets overruled in <st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lawrence</i></st1:place></st1:City>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We left off talking about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Griswold</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now we will talk
about the relationship of contraception to abortion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To understand that discussion, Foley will
give us a bit of history: the history concerning the status of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>
was the main precedent relied upon in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roe
v. Wade</i> when the right to abortion was recognized under the substantive due
process doctrine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some of the
intermediate precedents had expanded the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>
precedent from married to unmarried couples.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When, in the 1980s, the Reagan Administration and the Department of
Justice under Attorney General <span class=SpellE>Meese</span> asked the
Supreme Court to overrule <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roe</i>, there
was a lot of discussion about what is right or wrong in Constitutional Law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The question came up when President Reagan
nominated Robert Bork for the U.S. Supreme Court when Justice Powell retired in
1986.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bork was known to be an opponent
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roe v. Wade</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Senate hearings discussed the extent of
his opposition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sen. Specter in
particular asked Bork whether he disagreed with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Griswold</i> also.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bork said
that he did disagree, saying that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entire
</i>doctrine of substantive due process was illegitimate, whether as
articulated in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lochner</i></span>
or in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since neither contraception nor abortion is
specified in the Constitution, Bork felt that there shouldn’t be any such
rights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bork was rejected by the Senate,
and then Kennedy was nominated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
refused to take Bork’s position that substantive due process is wrong always
and under all circumstances.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With
respect to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>,
he clearly embraced the decision and accepted it as correct governing
precedent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Senate accepted Kennedy even though he didn’t say what
he thought about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roe</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kennedy’s vote is the crucial vote in
reaffirming <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roe</i> in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Casey</i> decision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kennedy changed his mind about overruling <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roe</i> and joined a plurality opinion to
sustain <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roe</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So how do we understand the relationship of
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i> decision to
abortion?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kennedy changed his mind about
this: can the Constitution protect the right to contraception as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i> holds, yet not protect a right
to abortion as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roe</i> holds?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Meese</span> and others
argued that the Court was not right to protect a right to abortion even though
it was right to protect the right to contraception.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what’s the difference between contraception and
abortion?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Contraception is preventative,
while abortion terminates an existing pregnancy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, it does prevent a birth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>
prevented any form of birth control, including IUDs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>IUDs are considered a contraceptive in common
parlance, but they work by preventing implantation, rather than preventing
fertilization.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In some sense, that could
be considered abortion rather than contraception depending on how you define
things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, the “morning after pill”
works up to 72 hours after fertilization.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So some forms of birth control prevent fertilization and some do
not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We will find that viability becomes
an important turning point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i> did not decide
the question of what should happen when a woman is 12 weeks into a
pregnancy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Roe</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Casey</i> decisions
cover a woman who is 12 weeks pregnant, but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>
did not purport to cover such a factual pattern.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As far as the morning-after pill and IUD go, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i> explicitly covers at least the
IUD, even though it is post-fertilization.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But is RU-486 within <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>
or beyond <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is it a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>-covered
case or a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roe</i>-covered case?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does it make a difference when you take
RU-486?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Where do we draw the line?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Should this be a purely legislative
decision?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is the Court simply making
value judgments?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We must address this as a constitutional issue as
lawyers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we suppose that the Court <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>had</i> overruled <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Roe</i> in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Casey</i>, or if it does
so in the future, and thus abortion is no longer protected, then what is the
legally correct scope of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most people today, partly because of the
history of Bork losing his nomination, say that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Griswold</i> has to remain accepted as Constitutional Law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Purists like Scalia can no longer make it to
the Court, and every nominee coming before the Senate must accept <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i> as good law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Souter</span> ducked the
question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the political compromise
in the Senate is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i> must
stand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Roe</i> were overturned, we would still have to figure out what <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i> would still mean.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One argument made in favor of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Roe</i> as precedent is that these cases stand for a “zone of personal
privacy” with respect to reproductive choices.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As long as these decisions stand, it is argued, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> will never be like <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
where you may only have a certain number of children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scalia or Bork would say that this might be a wonderful
right to protect, and we’re not <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
because our legislatures would not adopt forced sterilization laws.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, they would argue that we don’t have
protection in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Constitution</i>
against forced sterilization because that’s not in the Constitution.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They would say that we could <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>amend</i> the Constitution if we wanted
to.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the Constitution doesn’t dictate
a specific answer!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i> meant
to protect the use of IUDs, then it must protect contraception/abortion for up
to 72 hours after fertilization, according to Foley.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The language of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Griswold</i> focuses on privacy in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>home</i>, and in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bedroom</i>
in particular.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is the impact of
this precedent on the regulation of RU-486?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One of the virtues of RU-486 is that it can be available in an emergency
when the need for contraception was not anticipated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just as <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Lochner</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>was overruled,
there is the chance for this branch of substantive due process to get overruled
too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Roe</i> gets overruled, does the whole modern substantive due process
apparatus fall as well?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or will <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i> stand?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the Constitution protect sexual freedom
on the one hand, or reproductive freedom on the other?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the old days, sex and reproduction went
together.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But with modern technology, we
can have sex without reproduction and reproduction without sex.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Constitutional Law has to try to think
through how to deal with these issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stenberg v. <span
class=SpellE>Carhart</span></i> – Why is this case important?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a case that could actually come up in
practice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s also a hard case to
read.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s the most recent abortion
decision from the Supreme Court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
a hot issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s also a new statute
that Congress has enacted that purportedly bans “partial birth abortion”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some see this as a direct challenge to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stenberg</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This statute is in trial in three different
districts, including <st1:State><st1:place>Nebraska</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does Congress have the power to take a second
look at <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stenberg</i>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s likely that this current litigation will
work its way back to the Supreme Court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s sort of a <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marbury</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Madison</i> issue, too!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So why did the <st1:State><st1:place>Nebraska</st1:place></st1:State>
law fail?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It didn’t contain a health
exception, but only a life exception.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Also, the Court believed it might affect two different abortion
procedures and not just one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s D
&amp; E and D &amp; X.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>D &amp; E is much
more common.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>D &amp; X involves taking
the fetus out and then destroying it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>D
&amp; E basically involves destroying it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>then</i>
taking it out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <st1:State><st1:place>Nebraska</st1:place></st1:State>
law applied both pre- and post-viability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But you can’t ban all post-viability abortions unless you have a life
and health exception.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To the extent that
D &amp; X is necessary to protect the health of the mother, it can’t be
banned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To the extent that it’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>necessary to protect the health of
the mother, it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> be
constitutionally regulated or banned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Basically, if <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anybody</i>
thinks that D &amp; X is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ever</i>
medically necessary, then you can’t ban it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The dissent says that most reputable doctors say that D &amp; X is never
really necessary, and so states should be able to outlaw it if they want,
especially because D &amp; E is another choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>O’Connor sided with the liberals in this case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Casey</i>,
she upheld significant provisions of the <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>
law that the liberals wanted out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What do we make of all of this?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do we know, under constitutional law,
whether the majority or the dissent is right?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Is there an answer on the face of the Constitution?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No way!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Constitution is silent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
about the Court’s precedents?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kennedy

the “true follower” of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Casey</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both O’Connor and Kennedy also claimed to be
the true adherents to Powell’s opinion in <span class=SpellE><i

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The two middle-of-the-road justices in the
current Court both claim the authority to be the moderate “voice of reason”
here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is it possible for us as lawyers
to make a judgment on that debate in terms of which side is being more faithful
to the precedent?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the precedent
provide an answer to the question, or is it sufficiently indeterminate so that
both sides can claim to be right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is the “undue burden” in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

burden on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reproductive rights</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of Scalia’s criticisms is the vague
nature of the undue burden test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some of
the more liberal members don’t like the undue burden test, but made the
compromise to get the votes in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Casey</i>.<span

– This is an assisted suicide case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s
another sensitive, difficult issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Here’s a trick question: what does terminal sedation mean?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a patient is terminally ill and suffering
a lot of pain and needs painkillers, one medical practice is to give increasing
doses of painkillers to try to alleviate the pain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if the pain is really, really bad and
there’s no other form of treatment, in order to give adequate pain medication
needed to relieve the pain actually causes the patient to go into a coma (to be
sedated).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only way to take the patient
out of the coma would be to withdraw the level of painkiller.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That puts the doctor in a bind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Addressing pain means the patient must go
into a coma.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What doctors will sometimes
do in those situations, if it’s according to the patient’s wishes, is that
they’ll administer the degree of pain killers necessary to avoid the pain and
then cause the coma.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since that’s
irreversible in the sense that the only way to reverse it would be to bring
back the pain, then the patient may authorize the doctor to withdraw life
support after the coma has been entered into.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So it’s kind of a roundabout way to euthanasia.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is this the same or different from
physician-assisted suicide?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How does
that factual question relate to the legal question of the right to physician-assisted
suicide and whether there’s no right to terminal sedation?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can states outlaw terminal sedation if they
can outlaw physician-assisted suicide?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With terminal sedation, the patient dies of the original
illness (or dehydration) while in physician-assisted suicide death is caused by
a drug overdose.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Suicide is not
considered acceptable, but refusing treatment <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s hard to read this decision and figure out what the
state of the law is in light of this verdict.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is a 9-0 decision!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there
are lots of different concurrences.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Rehnquist gets five votes, but if you take O’Connor’s concurrence and
add it to <span class=SpellE>Breyer’s</span> separate concurrence and the other
separate opinions, you’ll see that there are five votes scattered about that go
out of their way to address the pain killing and terminal sedation idea.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you add them up, they seem to say that
they are sympathetic to the notion that there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>would </i>be a constitutional right to receive as much pain medication
as you need to avoid pain even if the consequence is that it causes sedation
and thus the withdrawal of life support.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yes!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s just the same as refusing food and water.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But where does that constitutional right come
from?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you had to write a brief on
this, what would you point to that shows that this right exists?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could cite to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Cruzan</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In that decision, we
assumed that the United States Constitution would grant a constitutionally
protected right to refuse life-saving hydration and nutrition.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That case might not explicitly reference
artificial respiration, but you can certainly draw the parallel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there isn’t going to be anything on the
face on the Constitution that says that there is any such right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a substantive due process right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cruzan</i>
is a Supreme Court precedent that acknowledges this right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the Supreme Court hedges on <i

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Glucksberg</i></span>, though, the assumption is pretty strong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What gives the Supreme Court the power to say that
substantive due process provides for this specific right?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They point to history and tradition.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court finds that tradition shows a
recognized right to personal physical integrity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, the common law tort of battery
shows that it is considered a wrong to touch someone in any way without their
position.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then again, a battery statute
could be passed to exclude doctors protecting life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court suggests, however, that this
statute may be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unconstitutional</i> under
substantive due process.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A common law
idea that has been around from time immemorial may take on constitutional
status!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Wow…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why should tradition and history be a guide in answering
substantive due process questions?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
is important about history and tradition?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Slavery is part of our history and traditions!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Dred</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Scott</i> was the
first substantive due process case!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment was used to say that Congress had no
right to disallow slavery in the new territories.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A slaveholder claimed that slavery was
protected by the Constitution under the Due Process Clause!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So should tradition really be the benchmark
for evaluating substantive due process claims???<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe it can be argued that the good parts of
our country come from innovation rather than looking backwards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recall that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cruzan</i>
case represented a situation where the patient was in a coma and she hadn’t
given any advance directive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a
debate over what her wishes and intentions were.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re unconscious and injured, emergency
medical personnel will default to helping you out if they have no information
to the contrary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scalia would say that if you could find the existence of a
tradition at the most specific way you could articulate it, that was the
tradition that the Court was bound to follow, even if you could articulate a
more general tradition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The reason to
adopt this approach would be to make justices more objective and less dependent
on their own preferences.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they could
choose to look at their judgments more broadly, it would be easier to find a
tradition that fits your particular preferences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Justice Brennan says that the right level of tradition
shouldn’t be found just in terms of specifics, but in terms of the general idea
that the Constitution is supposed to protect liberty and protect minorities
against the majority.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, it would be
argued, that we should look at the spirit and purpose of the Constitution when
searching for tradition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore,
don’t worry about the narrow historical record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Casey</i> rejects the
notion of searching for tradition at the narrow level and instead says that the
Court’s cases aren’t consistent with that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>With respect to the right to marry, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Loving v. Virginia</i>, involving interracial marriage, the Court said
that if we look at tradition narrowly, American history supported a narrow
conception of marriage and allowed the states to punish interracial marriages
and make them crimes and that that tradition existed for long periods of time
after even the Civil War and the Fourteenth Amendment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Loving</i>,
the Court didn’t look at tradition narrowly, but rather it adopted a more
expansive view of tradition, allowing a broader understanding of reproductive
freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scalia’s rejoinder on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Loving</i>
would be to say that it was true that the Court relied <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>in part</i> on substantive due process, but the Court could have relied
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>just</i> on Equal Protection Clause and
the fact that racial discrimination is unconstitutional.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Scalia would deny that substantive due process
was necessary to reach the decision!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Therefore, he would say that you shouldn’t use that precedent to justify
a more expansive interpretation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Constitution expresses sets of competing values!<span

Constitution is a document that advocates for liberty on its face.<span

liberty should be protected in a fundamental way.<span

philosophers say, because they can’t use the concept of due process to override
the judgment of legislatures.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a

<p class=MsoNormal>The opinion talks about recent history in two different
ways.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First, it talks about the recent
history of decriminalizing sexual acts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then, since the 1970s a minority of states has passed a law like the one
in <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State> that just punishes gay

had not been to discriminate against gays as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

</span>There were sodomy laws since the colonial era, right up to the
post-Civil War era and after.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So there
has been a trend of liberalization, but also a trend of targeting gay sexual
relations in particular for legal condemnation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Is it so clear that the trend among the states speaks in favor of what
the Court is doing here?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This decision
doesn’t protect prostitution, but it does protect casual sex that isn’t
prostitution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do we explain
this?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>History and tradition don’t seem
to do it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the state’s interest is
morality and that’s not good enough to uphold sodomy laws, then why is that
good enough for prostitution?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe the
exchange of money is seen as demeaning sex.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why does <st1:State><st1:place>Nevada</st1:place></st1:State> permit
prostitution while other states ban it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most people historically have thought that marriage is about
love and romance and stuff.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there

</span>It’s not just a social relationship but also an economic relationship!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why can’t states have the right to declare that gay sex or
sodomy is wrong when they can have the right to say that prostitution is
wrong?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do we know what the
Constitution says?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Constitution
doesn’t say anything about it, at least not directly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the things that <st1:City><st1:place><i

about is the right of two individuals to engage in intimate relationships at

tradition or reasoned judgment?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe we
can dignify group sex/intimate relations/marriage with constitutional
protection.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court has held that the
Constitution doesn’t protect polygamy, but that case was from the 19<sup>th</sup>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the point of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lawrence</i>
is that the culture is now more open and doesn’t think that homosexuality is
wrong, to what extent do we need the Court interpreting the Constitution to
decide these cases?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If that’s the
cultural view, then presumably the democratic system will sort it out.<span

</span>Foley says that the majority in <st1:City><st1:place><i

not mean to say that the Constitution gives gays the right to marry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But how can the Court justify that
intellectually?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So does the Federal Constitution require a state to extend
the right to marry to homosexual couples on the same terms that it grants such
rights to heterosexual couples?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
majority isn’t explicitly ready to take such a step.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The opinion suggests sort of the reverse of <span

provision.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe in 25 years, gay
marriage will be allowed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How can this
be justified as a legal judgment?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
individuals who are on the Court now would vote to say that the Constitution
doesn’t require equality of marriage as a matter of Con Law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Will the justices not enforce the Constitution because
they’re <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not ready to</i>?<span

the Constitution back then but they understand it correctly now.<span

</span>James Madison, when he wrote the list of rights in the Bill of Rights
and submitted it to the states, did not include a right of marriage because he
thought it was so obvious.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The idea that
Congress could take that right away was so far fetched that there was no reason
to say anything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He talked about the
things that people were afraid that the American government would do because
tyrannical governments like the British government did them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He also said: “This isn’t a complete list of
all the things that tyrannical governments do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Ninth Amendment says that there are other rights that should be
protected but aren’t listed.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you asked
James Madison whether the right to marry was fundamental, he would say: “Absolutely.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once the right to marry is worthy of
constitutional status, then a new aspect (contraception) comes along and you
can argue that it must be protected as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>part
of</i> that essential right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That would
be a way to understand <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Griswold</i>, at

in the back of our minds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But let’s get
the facts of this case out on the table.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What’s going on?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What are the
facts, and what is the constitutional question?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State> statute
prohibited homosexuals from adopting children.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There were some gay couples who wanted to adopt, so they challenged the
statute on constitutional grounds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Were
there any exceptions to the prohibition?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was an across-the-board
prohibition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under no circumstances
whatsoever could a gay person adopt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
are told that the law only applies to people who are actually “practicing
homosexuals”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re not celibate, and
you’re gay, you’re not allowed to adopt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about the constitutional issues?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute is challenged under due process
and equal protection.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is claimed that
the statute violated family integrity and that it also went against the holding
of <st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lawrence</i></st1:place></st1:City>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are two substantive due process
issues.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the difference between
the two?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With the family intimacy issue,
there is case law from the U.S. Supreme Court under substantive due process
that protects certain kinds of family rights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Some of the cases are very old!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The cases deal with interference into family liberty and autonomy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lofton as a foster parent had entered a
relationship with the child.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He claims
that this law interferes with that relationship.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If that’s the family substantive due process
argument, what’s the other one?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
argued that <st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lawrence</i></st1:place></st1:City>
created a fundamental right to sexual intimacy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you must be celibate in order to adopt, that limits your sexual
freedom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the equal protection
claim?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They claim that the means don’t
fit the ends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One additional fact about the claim is that with respect to
Lofton, the department of the <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>
government that deals with adoption periodically reviewed him and said he was
doing a great job.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The agency went
beyond that too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a finding by
the social workers in the agency that it would have been in the best interest
of the child to be adopted by Lofton.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There were factual findings in this case that he would be a good
permanent parent for the child.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the
prohibition is categorical and doesn’t allow exceptions case-by-case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court says that it doesn’t matter that he
is the best parent!</p>

fight the precedent from on high simply because they don’t like it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isn’t there a doctrine that says if Congress acquiesces in a
Supreme Court understanding of a statute, then that’s that?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>
legislature doesn’t have the last word on this as to whether their actions
violate the Constitution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The proper
conclusion may be that no federal constitutional right has been violated.<span

court in the absence of the Supreme Court decision to try to anticipate
it?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>But we believe in precedent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don’t have a civil law system like in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Precedent has two functions: it is supposed
to bind the court that issues precedents, and it is supposed to also bind lower
court judges to follow it unless and until it’s overruled, whether they like it
or not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lower court judges are not
allowed to think of themselves as interpreting the Constitution directly; it’s not
just them and the document.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They must
ask: “What does the Constitution mean as interpreted by Supreme Court
precedent?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the U.S. Supreme Court issued the initial school prayer

<p class=MsoNormal>One final thought about substantive due process: hopefully
this will provide some comfort.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley
has been studying this for 20 years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
thought it was fascinating, especially the abortion issue.<span

substantive due process.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He still
doesn’t feel like he really understands substantive due process!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He feels like he understands it better than
in law school, and he’s published articles on the subject.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe other people can figure it out, but
he’s at a point where he feels that it’s an inherently insoluble problem.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some students have observed that the Court’s
methodology in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Glucksberg</i></span>

is the more recent decision.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They seem
to choose their approach based on whether they want to grant or deny a
right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Basically, don’t worry if you’re
anxious about substantive due process.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Nobody really understands it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
constitutional meaning of liberty will take on many different viewpoints.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These issues apply to the substantive due process concept
and the procedural due process concept.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We may get a state action question in practice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The state action doctrine is that the
provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only</i>
apply to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>state actors</i> (state
governments and their subsidiaries, including local governments).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So these provisions only apply to people like
the governor, attorney general, or some other state actor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can’t sue the Ford Motor Company, for
example, for violating substantive due process.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are provisions of statutory law that apply to the private sector,
but in order to prevail on a Fourteenth Amendment claim, you must be suing <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the government</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s also true of any provision of the Bill
of Rights as incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Look at the example of campus speech codes: are “civility
codes” an infringement on the freedom of speech?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a big debate about this at
Stanford.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They talked about free speech
as an issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the First Amendment
freedom of speech as law does not apply to <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Stanford</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, because it is a private
university, not a public university.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On
the other hand, OSU is part of the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
state government, and we’re bound by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whether a campus civility code is applicable
to a state university is a real issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>On the other hand, it’s merely a moral principle when applied to a
private university.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The state action
doctrine is very crucial in defining the scope of constitutional rights
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you ever get a state action doctrine question in
practice, look it up in Chemerinsky.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
reason there may be questions is that there are exceptions or “wrinkles” to
this idea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes the conduct of a
private entity is still <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>attributable</i>
to the government, and thus that private entity is considered a state actor
even though it’s technically <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not the
government</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is useful to think of
this as an exception to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general rule</i>
that you can’t sue Microsoft, for example, under the Fourteenth Amendment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The two exceptions are clustered under two
categories: (1) the public function exception and (2) the
entanglement/entwinement exception.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The public function exception says that private entities,
typically corporations, act in a way that you would expect the government to
do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Take as an example a “company
town”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a company owns a whole town,
that company is really acting like the government for that municipality.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since cities are considered arms of state
governments, we’ll say that this privately-owned city can be sued just like the
state government for violating the Fourteenth Amendment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s one kind of exception.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are pressure points put on this
doctrine: consider, for example, <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Easton</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Town</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType>Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a mall, but it’s not enclosed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s outdoors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would the corporation that owns <st1:City><st1:place>Easton</st1:place></st1:City>
be considers an arm of the government because it controls the “streets” of <st1:City><st1:place>Easton</st1:place></st1:City>
and runs security there?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Foley believes
that because it isn’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really</i> a town
it wouldn’t be considered to be like a city government.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The rule would apply: you can’t sue <st1:City><st1:place>Easton</st1:place></st1:City>
for violating the Fourteenth Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If, on the other hand, <st1:City><st1:place>Easton</st1:place></st1:City>
developed such that it had its own schools, homes, and so on, then it’s
possible that it could be found to be performing a public function.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The entanglement exception says that if the
government contracts out one of its functions to a private entity, that entity
will be considered a state actor <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only in
terms of the action it performs for the government</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The precedents that exist cannot be reconciled into a
coherent whole.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The “liberal” position
attributes state action to more private entities.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The heyday was during the <st1:Street><st1:address>Warren
  Court</st1:address></st1:Street>, which was very aggressive in asserting
civil rights and trying to eliminate discrimination.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That Court was more inclined to find the
existence of state action if facts warranted it and say that a particular
private entity is doing what the government “used to do”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Consider the example of “white flight” to
private schools: are these schools really private, or are they taking over the
public school system?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were a
series of liberal precedents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the
other hand, the <st1:Street><st1:address>Rehnquist Court</st1:address></st1:Street>
has been much more conservative.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
have rolled back many of the previous Court’s decisions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if you find a great case from the <st1:Street><st1:address>Warren
  Court</st1:address></st1:Street> that seems to support your client’s
position, you must take it with a grain of salt, thinking about how the modern
Court would regard its earlier decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

the crediting agency.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The argument was
that the Athletic Association was taking on a public function and acting in a

<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>NCAA v. <span class=SpellE>Tarkanian</span></i>,
which was an earlier <st1:Street><st1:address>Rehnquist Court</st1:address></st1:Street>
decision.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bottom line seems to be
that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>most </i>of the schools regulated at
the high school level are public schools.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So anybody who is charged with accrediting and regulating high schools
is performing a public function, according to the Court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the college level, however, there’s much
more of a split between public and private schools.<span

doesn’t say anything about detention specifically.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe we have two different statutes that
point in opposite directions, and we could construe either one of them to be
controlling if we wanted to.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both
statutes can be interpreted to apply, and they conflict.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe we’re in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Youngstown Sheet</i> twilight zone!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Neither side wants to argue that we’re in the “maybe” box.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One side wants “yes”, and one side wants
“no”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Justice Department wanted extra powers to deal with
terrorism in light of 9/11.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The PATRIOT
Act is a big law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Act expires on its
own terms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It provides the President a
lot more ability to investigate foreigners.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How will the PATRIOT Act come into play?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It might put us more in the “twilight zone”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if Padilla was a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>member</i> of al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would that be enough to give the President
authority?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quirin</i></span>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That person was a member of the German
Army.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s different being the German
Army versus membership in al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span> because <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is a country with a real army and al <span class=SpellE>Qaeda</span> is not a
country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if Congress has said that
we’re at war with this paramilitary organization, then it would be argued that
membership is enough.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a lot of
back-and-forth that will go on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
would be a harder case for Padilla if he were a member of al <span
class=SpellE>Qaeda</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other
tricky hypothetical would be if Padilla had been captured with the equipment
necessary to build a dirty bomb.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
must be some inherent authority of the executive branch to protect the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> from radioactive bombs blowing
up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would justify some kind of
original, temporary detention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two big issues: the detention is of a unilateral
and indefinite nature based on whatever evidence he thinks is appropriate
without any judicial review.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the
other hand, you must wonder to what extent the Court would be comfortable
saying that there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no military
jurisdiction at all</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the military
had no role to play, then someone who was working for a military power in an
effort to blow up buildings and kill people and who was caught is not subject
to military authority.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What the Court
may do is rest on the fact that we have neither membership nor any overt sign
of belligerence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Either one by itself
would be enough, perhaps even in the “twilight zone” if that’s where we
are.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>If the government
catches someone who is a member of a military organization that we are at war
with, or if they’re caught red-handed engaged in a military operation pursuant
to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>orders</i> of that organization,
then either one of those facts might give the President sufficient authority.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Padilla wasn’t caught red handed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He also isn’t alleged to be a member.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the absence of either of those facts, the
Court may say that he has to be prosecuted in civilian courts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court may be nervous about accepting the government’s
position in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i> in terms of the
unilateral authority the President is said to assert.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are implications for this in terms of
the idea of liberty in the Constitution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court is going to go back into history to reach some judgments about
what is the appropriate position it should take.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the Court says no to the President in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i>, that would be a historically
significant act for the Court to take.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Foley says that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i> feels
like a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really big case</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By 1984, the <st1:Street><st1:address>Warren Court</st1:address></st1:Street>
seemed like ancient history.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the
distance between the <st1:Street><st1:address>Warren Court</st1:address></st1:Street>
and 1984 is the same twenty years between the <st1:Street><st1:address>Burger
  Court</st1:address></st1:Street> and today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In 1984, we had no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lawrence</i>,
no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lopez</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Morrison</i>, and no <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Printz</i></span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Constitutional
Law ebbs and flows in ways that are difficult to notice at any one moment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In terms of Separation of Powers, these cases
about being in war weren’t important.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When you get a case like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Padilla</i>
that links back to the earlier periods like 1944, you find that there are some
big themes that stay constant in Constitutional Law even though it ebbs and
flows.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some cases strike at the core of
what the country is all about.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
were two big developments during World War II.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Korematsu</i></span>
is thought to be a terrible mistake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Barnette</i></span> was a
First Amendment case that was a great victory for liberty.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a decision that said that
schoolchildren can’t be kicked out of school for failing to salute the
flag.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Initially, they were ordered to
salute the flag, but the Court said that the concept of liberty in
Constitutional Law is strong enough to allow that dissent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Robert Jackson wrote the majority opinion in <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Barnette</i></span> and
wrote the dissent in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Korematsu</i></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He seems to write opinions with extra power
and insight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The point of Jackson’s dissent in <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Korematsu</i></span> was that the courts
sometimes can’t stop armies from doing what they need to do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Barnette</i></span>, <st1:City><st1:place>Jackson</st1:place></st1:City>
told us that the role of the courts and the Constitution are to protect those
things that are beyond voting.</p>

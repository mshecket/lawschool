<p><span>We
will do affirmative action today, tomorrow, and Thursday and deal with <span

<p><span>We
talked yesterday about the way that the Court, in rejecting the “floodplain”
defense of the ordinance, said that this may be a legitimate interest, but the
regulation is not plausibly related to the interest. If they had given <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>super </i>deference, they may have come to a different conclusion. Some people think that the rational basis
test here was “rational basis plus” or “rational basis with bite” or “rational
basis with teeth”. How minimal is the
requirement of the rational basis test? Does there just need to be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quantum</i>
of overlap between the ends and means? Or does there have to be some kind of minimum fit?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Justice
Stevens gives us the “sliding scale” idea. He doesn’t want to think about three boxes (strict scrutiny,
intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis). He wants a range of deference. But the Court doesn’t embrace the Stevens approach, and claims that it
is applying the traditional rational basis approach. The best understanding is that we have a “turbocharged”
version of the rational basis review, but we don’t know when the Court will
apply this version as opposed to the regular version.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
would the precedents of </span><st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
  normal'><span>Cleburne</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span> and <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Beazer</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> </i>apply to different fact patterns? The <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Beazer</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>plaintiffs might succeed in terms of
housing, and the </span><st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
  normal'><span>Cleburne</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span> plaintiffs might fail with
respect to jobs.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
major point here is: the judgments that underlie speculations about job discrimination
with respect to the mentally retarded would be upheld, while housing discrimination
against recovering drug addicts would <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>
be upheld. The difference in judgment is
based on the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>facts</i> and on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>policy</i>, not from the Constitution.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Professor Foley just made a
dime appear out of nowhere!</span></i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Think
about the factual differences between cases to try to distinguish them. It’s more important to be able to argue both
sides of cases than to actually come to a conclusion.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=SpellE><b><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Grutter</span></i></b></span><b><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> v. Bollinger</span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
is the constitutional question in this case? What claim are the plaintiffs making? The plaintiffs claim that <span class=SpellE>Grutter</span> was denied
admission to the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Law</span></st1:PlaceName><span style='font-size:
 14.0pt;'> </span><st1:PlaceType><span
 >School</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span> because of her race. How does that relate to the Constitution? What makes denial to law school based on race
a problem based on the Constitution? She
claims it violates the Equal Protection Clause to make race a predominant or
outcome-determinative factor in whether someone gets admitted or not.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
do we know that race was a factor in whether she was denied admission? We clearly have facial discrimination. Race is taken into account in admissions. But diversity could be based on things other
than race. What role does racial and
ethnic diversity play in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>’s definition of their
policy? There was a remedial
function. Some groups were considered to
have suffered discrimination, and thus they should be helped out as a form of
compensation or remediation. They single
out Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans. Be precise in your language. Different people were said to bring different
ideas to class discussion.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Both
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and the Supreme Court see the beneficiaries of this
policy as not merely the minority students, but all students. Justice Thomas objects that the policy is
designed to benefit mostly Caucasians and Asians and that the individuals who
are admitted because of special consideration actually suffer a sort of stigma.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Are
there any other reasons to justify these affirmative action programs besides
the classroom learning environment? The
Court also considers that fact that the business community and the military
support affirmative action. Why did the
business community submit the amicus brief that they did? They said that we live in an increasingly
multicultural society, and so to be well-educated, you must be exposed to
diversity. So we want a good experience
in the classroom, and we want students prepared for diversity outside the
classroom.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about the military? That’s very
important, but it’s a little different than what the businesses say. What’s the national security deal? The military says that we need a diverse
officer corps for national security. The
military argues that there is racial diversity in the world’s hotspots. The brief that was filed by the former
military officers is one of the most significant and powerful amicus briefs
ever filed. In </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Vietnam</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, there was a lot of race
tension because there were more minorities in the lower ranks and more majority
people in the higher ranks. The military
decided that you must have an officer corps that is representative of the
nation as a whole. The racial
composition of the officer corps cannot differ too greatly from that of the
troops. The Court makes the point of
legitimacy. The majority talks about the
idea of the legitimacy of our government depending on leadership positions
being open to all regardless of racial background. How is this argument different than the “classroom
diversity” argument?</span></p>

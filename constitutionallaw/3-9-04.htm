          over! But don�t panic. We�re not expected to memorize all the details
          of the mechanics of equal protection litigation. We can find out more
          in an upper-level course. Plus, we can always go back and consult
          Chemerinsky if necessary.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s use the methodologies of over- and under-inclusiveness to
          evaluate the claims in this case.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the equal protection claim against the Transit Authority? What
          is the discrimination that allegedly violates the Equal Protection
          Clause? They say that it�s not fair to bar methadone users from
          working for them. The rule doesn�t label people as methadone users who
          do or don�t pose a risk. It treats all methadone users, and all users
          of narcotics the same.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How is this rule over-inclusive? It includes methadone users who pose
          no safety threat at all. That�s the point. Within the category of
          methadone users, there will be some safe employees and some unsafe
          employees. The considerations motivating the Transit Authority seems
          different depending on just what kind of jobs their workers are going
          to do.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How is this rule under-inclusive? The Transit Authority is trying to
          prevent unsafe workers from harming the public. But there might be
          other kinds of people other than narcotics users who might not be fit
          to operate trains and buses safely.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Methadone users are recovering drug addicts. If you�re a stable
          methadone user, you�re coping with a prior heroin addiction. It is
          stipulated that after a year of methadone treatment, you�re at no more
          risk of relapse than the general public. However, there will be other
          people subject to employment by the Transit Authority who could be
          considered a safety risk. For example, how about alcoholics? The rule
          doesn�t apply to them, and there�s no separate rule that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">does </i>apply to them.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This combination of over- and under-inclusiveness shows that there
          really is discrimination! But is it wrongful? There�s a mismatch
          between the rule adopted and the government�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">professed</i> safety concerns.
          There�s a bad fit between the ends and the means.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why isn�t this discrimination unconstitutional? The Court says that
          the rational basis test applies. Why is that?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Constitution doesn�t mention strict scrutiny! The Constitution
          doesn�t mention the rational basis test! The Constitution doesn�t even
          mention race or gender! So where do we get our categories? Is the
          Court just doing this by fiat? What�s the reasoning behind forming up
          these categories and lining them up the way they are? The Court makes
          the distinction between immutable characteristic versus things that
          you can change within your lifetime. These characteristics can be
          things you�re born with or things you�ve acquired but can no longer
          change. But does a rule that prevents blind people from getting
          drivers� licenses or pilots� licenses require strict scrutiny, since
          blindness is an immutable characteristic.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The thing about race is that it�s not just an immutable
          characteristic, but something that the courts have generally found to
          be a wrongful basis for discrimination. In the Court�s judgment, on
          the other hand, discrimination with respect to disability (for
          example), is not as frequently motivated by prejudice as is racial
          discrimination.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One of the most difficult things to grapple with when it comes to the
          Equal Protection Clause and its case law is just how amorphous the
          standard is. There are just a few words in the Constitution that
          historically have been interpreted as the Court has seen fit. Consider
          the opposite conclusion in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Brown v. Board of Education</i>
          as opposed to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Plessy v. Ferguson</i>. Both
          cases were decided on the exact same Equal Protection Clause! It is
          quite possible that the Supreme Court may, in the future, change its
          understanding of equal protection in many different ways.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The �boxes� we have talked about have changed. Not long ago, the
          Court thought that gender discrimination only deserved the rational
          basis test. Now, the Court places gender discrimination in at least
          the �medium scrutiny� box.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why does the Transit Authority treat recovering narcotic addicts
          differently than, for example, recovering alcoholics? Isn�t this
          clearly discrimination? You can distinguish: using heroin is illegal,
          while using alcohol isn�t for adults.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court doesn�t see this discrimination as improper prejudice.
          Therefore, they do not require anything higher than the rational basis
          test.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court in this case says that this may be wrong, but we�re not the
          ones to stop it. If society thinks it�s wrong to treat methadone users
          differently from recovering alcoholics, then new laws should be passed
          to change the system.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Consider the claim of discrimination against opticians in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. The court decided that this is more or less a political question.
          As long as there is a plausible health and safety question, the
          discrimination can go on.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why is the court saying that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">these</i> are the kinds of
          discrimination that we will not use our judicial power to
          overrule?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Equal Protection Clause only applies when the government is
          discriminating. Also, in the voting rights cases, the discrimination
          is among individuals with respect to voting rights.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The �Fundamental Rights� or �Fundamental Interests� strand of equal
          protection jurisprudence has to do with individual rights.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >When we study substantive due process, we�ll compare it to equal
          protection. The question there isn�t about equality of treatment, but
          rather of an expressly individual right.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We now know that the rational basis test is going to apply. But how
          can his rule that is just a misfit survive even under the lower level
          or rational basis review? All the Transit Authority has to say is that
          there is a slight safety risk in allowing methadone users to
          work.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If there is litigation under the rational basis test, the government
          must defend what it�s doing under that test. It must explain some
          connection, even if it is a loose connection. They can make up the
          policy after the fact and get the benefit of the doubt! The Rational
          Basis Test requires the court to show
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">extreme deference</i> to the
          legislature.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Before the </span><st1:place><span>Roosevelt</span></st1:place
        ><span>
          era, the Court was using the Equal Protection Clause to protect big
          business and to micromanage American economic policy. As part of the
          revolution of the New Deal, the Court said it would bend over
          backwards to uphold laws that further policy.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >From time to time, lower courts will mess this up. Not every episode
          of governmental discrimination violates the Equal Protection Clause.
          We don�t care very much about, for example, different taxes on slot
          machines on riverboats versus slot machines at racetracks.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if we knew there was an upcoming terrorist attack involving men
          of a particular ethnic group on planes? Would it be constitutional
          under the Equal Protection Clause for the government to conduct
          special surveillance procedures with respect to people of a particular
          ethnic group? Is this facial discrimination? If this is a policy,
          that�s facial discrimination. Does this policy, on its face, authorize
          conduct with a discriminatory motive?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court should apply strict scrutiny because this is discrimination
          based on race, religion, or national origin. What�s the next step? We
          need to look at the government�s asserted reason for engaging in this
          discrimination to see if it�s a compelling reason. There is certainly
          some degree of over-inclusion or under-inclusion. Padilla was not of
          the same ethnic background as al Qaeda. That�s under-inclusive. So
          picking out Arab-Americans at the airport will be over-inclusive. But
          is this <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">too</i> over- or
          under-inclusive given the necessity that the government asserts?</span

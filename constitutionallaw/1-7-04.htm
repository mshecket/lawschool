<p><span>Foley
is really tall!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Con
Law is different from every course we had last semester and different from a
lot of what we’re doing this semester…the biggest overlap is between Con Law
and Legislation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Boring administrative stuff</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Foley
lives in Room 202. It’s almost in the
very tippy point of the “prow of the ship” of the law school.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
a supplement or you can use Westlaw.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Office
hours are Tuesday from </span><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="15"><span
>3</span></st1:time><span> to </span><st1:time
Minute="0" Hour="17"><span>5
 PM</span></st1:time><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
on-call system is random. At the end of
each week, we’ll find out who’s on call for the following week. Foley thinks being “on-call” is more like
real life than mercilessly calling on anybody at any time.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>How Con Law is different</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Torts
and Contracts have Restatements. They’re
common law-based. There’s a place to
look to find “The Law”. In Criminal Law,
there’s the Model Penal Code. It’s a
pretty good conception of what Criminal Law “ought” to look like. With Civil Procedure, you look at the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure and that’s pretty much it. There’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>law</i>
there to be found in the first semester courses.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>With
Constitutional Law, you have to suspend that sense of law. Constitutional Law will feel very different
because there is no “Restatement of Constitutional Law”. Constitutional law is generally very fuzzy
and amorphous compared to common law or statutory law. Part of what the class is all about is coming
to terms with that. We have to deal with
this fuzziness in practice when we deal with the legal system.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
will focus on the process of constitutional argumentation. In other words, how do we, as lawyers,
advance a proposition of constitutional in support of an issue? It’s a question of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>craft</i> and of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>persuasiveness</i>. On both sides of the same issue, there may be
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>better ways</i> to advance an argument
than their alternatives. The goal is to
learn the craft and be able to distinguish between stronger and weaker forms of
constitutional argument. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Method</i> is what this is all about. It’s not about the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>result</i>. It’s a question of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>means</i> rather than <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ends</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
this course will be similar to Legislation insofar as it is also a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>methods</i> kind of course. So too will the Legal Writing course be a
methods course. This semester will feel
different than last semester! Property
will probably feel most like last semester. It’s a substantive class like Contracts.</span></p>

<br/>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>We’re not here
to learn the substance of Constitutional Law!</span></i></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></p>

<p><span>That’s
weird! We’re here to learn about <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>methods and processes of argument</i>. Constitutional Law will be even more <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>different </i>than Legislation or Legal
Writing.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
distinctive about constitutional law is that it’s an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>extraordinary </i>form of law: the rest of our legal system is, for the
most part, dominated by common law and statutory law. These bodies of law exist on the same plane
or hierarchy.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Common
law is judge-made law, but it can be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overruled
</i>by legislation. For example, if a judge
issues a pronouncement on an issue of torts or contracts, and the people of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> are upset by that, they
could try to persuade the Supreme Court to change their minds, but they would
run up against <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stare decisis</i>. Foley is a big believer in stare
decisis. This is the idea that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>courts follow their own precedents</i>. If the court issues a certain answer to a question,
the court will stick to that answer unless it’s overruled. But you overrule rarely and only with
adequate justification. On the other
hand, if you don’t like the proposition of contract or tort law that the court
has just adopted, you can go to General Assembly and ask them to use their
power to completely repudiate the Supreme Court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
point is that since the legislature can control, it’s in the driver’s
seat. Statutory law exists on the same
plane as common law. That means that common
law from the Supreme Court is authoritative unless and until it is replaced by statutory
law. Constitutional law exists on a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>higher plane of authority</i>. It’s the “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>supreme
law of the land</i>”. Within the state
of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, we have common law and statutory law, but above
both is </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> constitutional law. It sits on top of both.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
our federal system, the United States Constitution sits on top of statutory law
enacted by Congress. It’s supreme in
terms of hierarchy. When the Court
renders a decision of constitutional law, how do we revise it? What if we don’t like what the Supreme Court
does?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if the United States Supreme Court interprets an act of legislation in a way we
don’t agree with? For example, consider
the Sherman Act. Say the United States Supreme
Court says that Microsoft has no unlawful monopoly power, but we think the
interpretation was improper because Microsoft actually is bad. What can we do, short of replacing the
justices? We could try to get Congress
to write a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>new law </i>or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>amend </i>the current law to clarify it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the other hand, let’s say the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution in a
way that we think is wrong. Now
what? Can we go back to Congress and
have them undo that interpretation in the same way that they undid the
interpretation of the statute? Not
exactly. You’ll have to amend the Constitution! Everything that we learn about in Brudney’s
class Congress can fix by an ordinary act of Congress. But if something screws up in here, you need
to amend the Constitution and you can’t legislate out of it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It’s
really hard to amend the Constitution! It’s a heck of a lot tougher than changing a statute. We need two-thirds of each house of Congress
and ratification from three-quarters of the states. We’ve only had 27 amendments ever, and the
first 10 were a package deal. On the
other hand, we’ve had thousands and thousands of acts of Congress.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Amending
the Constitution is the only way to override the Supreme Court’s power of constitutional
interpretation unless you can persuade the Court that its previous ruling was
wrong. Everything else is ordinary in
that it’s subject to revision by ordinary constitutional processes. This is extraordinary! You need a lot to happen in order for constitutional
stuff to change! This is the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>key point</i> that makes constitutional law
distinctive.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Part
of the reading for tomorrow focuses on the Second Amendment. Think about the idea of the United States Supreme
Court trying to figure out what that amendment means. Think about it in the context of supposing
that Congress has adopted a law to prohibit Americans from owning machine guns. Is that law constitutional? Has it violated the Second Amendment? Is there a right to bear <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>machine guns</i>? How should the
United States Supreme Court go about answering that question? What does the Second Amendment mean, and how
does it apply to this hypothetical law?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>About Justice O’Connor</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
was the first assignment not to read the Constitution itself, but instead
reading about Justice O’Connor? Why not
start with the text itself?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
is Justice O’Connor considered so important? She’s the “swing vote” between the “liberal” and “conservative” wings of
the Court. O’Connor is most likely to “flip-flop”
between the two groups. In many of the
cases that have been decided in the last ten years, there are four on one side
of the issue and four on the other side with O’Connor (or sometimes Kennedy) in
the middle. O’Connor was the swing vote
in the affirmative action case <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
the voucher case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>O’Connor
wouldn’t be the swing vote if the answers to constitutional law were apparent
from reading the document itself. If you
could simply look through the Constitution and get the answer to every
question, then every decision of the Supreme Court would be 9-0. There would be no need for a swing vote! Some things are clear: you must be 35 to run
for President. But every case we read
this semester does not fall into the category of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>just looking it up</i>. Instead,
all the cases we’ll read will be ones where you can’t find the answer by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reading the document</i>. Instead, the answer is completely dependent
on the identity of the individuals who sit on the Court at a particular time in
history. The way things are is that the
answers to these questions often pop out of O’Connor’s head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Yesterday,
we talked about the law schools’ interest in having a diverse student body,
both in terms of classroom diversity and the workplace diversity that is
thought to follow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>We
also discussed the interest of the legitimacy the government.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is claimed that minority groups won’t see
the government as legitimate if they feel like the paths to power aren’t open
to them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We talked about this in the context
of the amicus brief from former military officers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It could apply just as well to other
institutions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The notion here is that the
minority communities in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> won’t trust the government
if it doesn’t include minorities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
helps explain why the Court feels that the state’s interest is compelling in
this case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They seem to feel that the
whole stability of the government is at stake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court feels that we cannot survive as a society unless we make legal
education available to everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>That’s
the first part of the analysis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s
the university’s position, and the Court embraces it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next, the second part of the analysis: if we
accept that diversity is a compelling state interest, why, in the university’s
view, is it necessary that the law school use the admissions policy that it did
in order to achieve diversity?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was
making race a factor in admissions decisions the best way to do it?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why does the law school believe itself of
being incapable of obtaining a diverse student body if it doesn’t make race a
factor in admissions?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
university claims that if they didn’t take race into account, they wouldn’t
otherwise get enough people from the various minority groups to form a “critical
mass”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nobody contests that
factually.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the law school relied only
on grades and LSAT scores, then they wouldn’t achieve “critical mass” or
sufficient diversity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The record
disclosed that if the law school relied solely on the numbers, minority
representation would be only 4% of the student population rather than 12-20%.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why not abandon using the number
altogether?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t want to abandon
their elitism, apparently.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They want to
be prestigious and selective.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How does
that relate to the compelling state interest?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is part of the dissent’s argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What if they used a lottery system?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then you would have a student body that is representative of the people trying
to get admitted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>If
the university’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>top</i> priority was
diversity, they could have open enrollment or a lottery.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But they have a higher priority on being an
elite law school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court seems to
tell us that the school is allowed to posit these “twin goals”
simultaneously.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>just</i> want diversity, they want to have
their cake and eat it too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only way
to do both, they claim, is to use race as an admissions factor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>combination
</i>of the two goals requires and justifies the use of race as an admissions
factor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Beyond
asserting that it wants to be a selective, elite law school, what underlying
policy goal or social need does the law school assert to justify its
selectivity as arising to the level of a compelling state interest?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t really give one!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a good point made by Justice
Thomas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority seems to say that the
law school can’t achieve both of its goals at the same time without making race
a factor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority credits this as
vital, but doesn’t explain why.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don’t
really know why it is such a compelling interest to have an elite law school as
a state law school.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They seem to say
that there must be open access to elite law schools because those law schools
are the paths to power in this country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But even if </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> didn’t have an elite law
school, there would still be elite law schools that are private and thus not
bound by the Equal Protection Clause (like Harvard, Yale, and Stanford).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there’s also part of the Civil Rights Act
that tracks the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it were unconstitutional for </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> to do what it did, it would
be illegal by statute under Title VI for Harvard to do what <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>it</i> did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
Court seems to say that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> wants to pursue two goals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it isn’t explained why </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> has these two goals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems to be based on the notion that we
will have highly selective law schools in American society, and some of them
will be public schools and we need to make sure that there is open access to
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s stipulate that strict
scrutiny applies in this case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ginsburg
believes that you shouldn’t have strict scrutiny in an affirmative action
context, but that’s not the view of the majority.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But under any level of scrutiny, you must
look at (1) the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>goal</i>, and (2) the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>means</i> and its relationship to the goal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The use of race as an admissions factor would
not be justified based on either of those goals <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>alone</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the university
only wanted to consider diversity, they wouldn’t need to consider race, and if
the university only wanted to have selective admissions, they wouldn’t need to
consider race either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Diversity
is a laudable goal, but you don’t need to make race a factor in order to have
diversity, because you could have a lottery instead.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s only the intersection of the goals of
diversity and selectivity that justifies the consideration of race in
admissions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But even taking these two
goals as compelling, why is it necessary for </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> to use racial background as
an admissions factor to achieve those goals?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are lots of “soft variables” that have nothing to do with race
that would not be considered under strict scrutiny.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could look at leadership potential, for
example.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
argument was made by the plaintiff that you don’t have to consider race as an
admissions factor at all for any applicant and maintain selectivity if you use “soft
factors” in a sophisticated way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is
argued that you can achieve all the goals that you want to as long as you don’t
rely on actual skin color.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>University</span></st1:PlaceType><span
 style='font-size:14.0pt;'> of </span><st1:PlaceName><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Michigan</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> asserted that it could not
achieve its twin goals without using race the way it did.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the plaintiffs never presented an
evidentiary case to challenge this assertion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The main strategy of the plaintiffs was to dispute diversity as a
compelling goal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They hoped that a majority
of the Court would reject the contention that diversity could count as a
compelling interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then their second
line of attack would be to show by statistics that the way race was used here
was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tantamount</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>to </i>a quota and too rigid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But they didn’t take on the other point: assuming the law school is not
operating a quota system, but rather a system of “soft factors”, is race a
necessary one of those factors?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Boalt
Hall has been prohibited from using race as a factor in admissions due to
Proposition 209.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Initially, the number
of minority students at Boalt Hall plummeted drastically, just like </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> was predicting here.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When this lawsuit was first litigated, that
was the scenario that Boalt Hall was operating on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, somehow it turns out that in the
last couple of years, Boalt Hall still can’t look at race, but somehow has
gotten its minority enrollment back to the levels it was at prior to
Proposition 209.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They claim that they
use a combination of hard factors and non-racial soft factors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiff, in its reply brief, cites
Boalt Hall as an example of how to achieve classroom diversity without
considering race explicitly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

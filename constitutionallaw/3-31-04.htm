        <span
          >Yesterday, we talked about the law schools� interest in having a
          diverse student body, both in terms of classroom diversity and the
          workplace diversity that is thought to follow.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >We also discussed the interest of the legitimacy the government. It
          is claimed that minority groups won�t see the government as legitimate
          if they feel like the paths to power aren�t open to them. We talked
          about this in the context of the amicus brief from former military
          officers. It could apply just as well to other institutions. The
          notion here is that the minority communities in </span
        ><st1:country-region
          ><st1:place><span>America</span></st1:place></st1:country-region
        ><span>
          won�t trust the government if it doesn�t include minorities. This
          helps explain why the Court feels that the state�s interest is
          compelling in this case. They seem to feel that the whole stability of
          the government is at stake. The Court feels that we cannot survive as
          a society unless we make legal education available to everyone.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >That�s the first part of the analysis. That�s the university�s
          position, and the Court embraces it. Next, the second part of the
          analysis: if we accept that diversity is a compelling state interest,
          why, in the university�s view, is it necessary that the law school use
          the admissions policy that it did in order to achieve diversity? Was
          making race a factor in admissions decisions the best way to do it?
          Why does the law school believe itself of being incapable of obtaining
          a diverse student body if it doesn�t make race a factor in
          admissions?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The university claims that if they didn�t take race into account,
          they wouldn�t otherwise get enough people from the various minority
          groups to form a �critical mass�. Nobody contests that factually. If
          the law school relied only on grades and LSAT scores, then they
          wouldn�t achieve �critical mass� or sufficient diversity. The record
          disclosed that if the law school relied solely on the numbers,
          minority representation would be only 4% of the student population
          rather than 12-20%. Why not abandon using the number altogether? They
          don�t want to abandon their elitism, apparently. They want to be
          prestigious and selective. How does that relate to the compelling
          state interest? This is part of the dissent�s argument. What if they
          used a lottery system? Then you would have a student body that is
          representative of the people trying to get admitted.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If the university�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">top</i> priority was diversity,
          they could have open enrollment or a lottery. But they have a higher
          priority on being an elite law school. The Court seems to tell us that
          the school is allowed to posit these �twin goals� simultaneously. They
          don�t <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">just</i> want diversity,
          they want to have their cake and eat it too. The only way to do both,
          they claim, is to use race as an admissions factor. The
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">combination </i>of the two
          goals requires and justifies the use of race as an admissions
          factor.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Beyond asserting that it wants to be a selective, elite law school,
          what underlying policy goal or social need does the law school assert
          to justify its selectivity as arising to the level of a compelling
          state interest? They don�t really give one! This is a good point made
          by Justice Thomas. The majority seems to say that the law school can�t
          achieve both of its goals at the same time without making race a
          factor. The majority credits this as vital, but doesn�t explain why.
          We don�t really know why it is such a compelling interest to have an
          elite law school as a state law school. They seem to say that there
          must be open access to elite law schools because those law schools are
          the paths to power in this country. But even if </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Michigan</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span>
          didn�t have an elite law school, there would still be elite law
          schools that are private and thus not bound by the Equal Protection
          Clause (like Harvard, Yale, and Stanford). But there�s also part of
          the Civil Rights Act that tracks the requirements of the Equal
          Protection Clause. If it were unconstitutional for </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          to do what it did, it would be illegal by statute under Title VI for
          Harvard to do what
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">it</i> did.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>The Court seems to say that </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Michigan</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span> wants to pursue two goals. But it isn�t explained why </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          has these two goals. It seems to be based on the notion that we will
          have highly selective law schools in American society, and some of
          them will be public schools and we need to make sure that there is
          open access to them. Let�s stipulate that strict scrutiny applies in
          this case. Ginsburg believes that you shouldn�t have strict scrutiny
          in an affirmative action context, but that�s not the view of the
          majority. But under any level of scrutiny, you must look at (1) the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">goal</i>, and (2) the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">means</i> and its relationship
          to the goal. The use of race as an admissions factor would not be
          justified based on either of those goals
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">alone</i>. If the university
          only wanted to consider diversity, they wouldn�t need to consider
          race, and if the university only wanted to have selective admissions,
          they wouldn�t need to consider race either.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Diversity is a laudable goal, but you don�t need to make race a
          factor in order to have diversity, because you could have a lottery
          instead. It�s only the intersection of the goals of diversity and
          selectivity that justifies the consideration of race in admissions.
          But even taking these two goals as compelling, why is it necessary for </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          to use racial background as an admissions factor to achieve those
          goals? There are lots of �soft variables� that have nothing to do with
          race that would not be considered under strict scrutiny. You could
          look at leadership potential, for example.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The argument was made by the plaintiff that you don�t have to
          consider race as an admissions factor at all for any applicant and
          maintain selectivity if you use �soft factors� in a sophisticated way.
          It is argued that you can achieve all the goals that you want to as
          long as you don�t rely on actual skin color. The </span
        ><st1:place
          ><st1:PlaceType><span>University</span></st1:PlaceType
          ><span> of </span
          ><st1:PlaceName><span>Michigan</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place
        ><span>
          asserted that it could not achieve its twin goals without using race
          the way it did. But the plaintiffs never presented an evidentiary case
          to challenge this assertion. The main strategy of the plaintiffs was
          to dispute diversity as a compelling goal. They hoped that a majority
          of the Court would reject the contention that diversity could count as
          a compelling interest. Then their second line of attack would be to
          show by statistics that the way race was used here was
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">tantamount</i>
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">to </i>a quota and too rigid.
          But they didn�t take on the other point: assuming the law school is
          not operating a quota system, but rather a system of �soft factors�,
          is race a necessary one of those factors?</span

        <span
          >Boalt Hall has been prohibited from using race as a factor in
          admissions due to Proposition 209. Initially, the number of minority
          students at Boalt Hall plummeted drastically, just like </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          was predicting here. When this lawsuit was first litigated, that was
          the scenario that Boalt Hall was operating on. However, somehow it
          turns out that in the last couple of years, Boalt Hall still can�t
          look at race, but somehow has gotten its minority enrollment back to
          the levels it was at prior to Proposition 209. They claim that they
          use a combination of hard factors and non-racial soft factors. The
          plaintiff, in its reply brief, cites Boalt Hall as an example of how
          to achieve classroom diversity without considering race
          explicitly.</span

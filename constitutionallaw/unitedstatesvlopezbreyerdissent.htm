<br/>

<p><span>The
issue in this case is whether the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to enact
a statute that makes it a crime to possess a gun in, or near, a school. 18
U.S.C. § 922(q<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)(A) (1988 ed., Supp. V). In my view,
the statute falls well within the scope of the commerce power as this Court has
understood that power over the last half century.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
reaching this conclusion, I apply three basic principles of Commerce Clause
interpretation. <span class=GramE>First, the power to &quot;regulate Commerce .
. . among the several States,&quot; U. S. Const., Art.</span> I, § 8, <span
class=SpellE>cl</span>. 3, encompasses the power to regulate local activities
insofar as they significantly affect interstate commerce. <span class=GramE>See,
e.g., Gibbons v. </span></span><st1:City><st1:place><span class=GramE><span
 >Ogden</span></span></st1:place></st1:City><span
class=GramE><span>, 9 Wheat.</span></span><span> <span class=GramE>1,
194-195 (1824) (Marshall, C. J.); <span class=SpellE>Wickard</span> v. <span
class=SpellE>Filburn</span>, 317 </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  class=GramE><span>U.S.</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
class=GramE><span> 111, 125
(1942).</span></span><span>
As the majority points out, ante, at 10, the Court, in describing how much of
an effect the Clause requires, sometimes has used the word
&quot;substantial&quot; and sometimes has not. Compare, e.g., <span
class=SpellE>Wickard</span>, supra, at 125 (&quot;substantial economic
effect&quot;), with <span class=SpellE>Hodel</span> v. Virginia Surface Mining
and Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 276 (1981) (&quot;affects interstate
commerce&quot;); see also Maryland v. <span class=SpellE>Wirtz</span>, 392 U.S.
183, 196, n. 27 (1968) (cumulative effect must not be &quot;trivial&quot;);
NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 37 (1937) (speaking of
&quot;close and substantial relation&quot; between activity and commerce, not
of &quot;substantial effect&quot;) (emphasis added); Gibbons, supra, at 194
(words of Commerce Clause do not &quot;comprehend . . . commerce, which is
completely internal . . . and which does not . . . affect other States&quot;). <span
class=GramE>And, as the majority also recognizes in quoting Justice Cardozo,
the question of degree (how much effect) requires an estimate of the
&quot;size&quot; of the effect that no verbal formulation can capture with
precision.</span> See ante, at 18. I use the word &quot;significant&quot; because
the word &quot;substantial&quot; implies a somewhat narrower power than recent
precedent suggests. <span class=GramE>See, e.g., Perez v. </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  class=GramE><span>United
  States</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class=GramE><span>, 402 </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  class=GramE><span>U.S.</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
class=GramE><span> 146, 154
(1971); Daniel v. Paul, 395 </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  class=GramE><span>U.S.</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
class=GramE><span> 298, 308
(1969).</span></span><span>
But, to speak of &quot;substantial effect&quot; rather than &quot;significant
effect&quot; would make no difference in this case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Second,
in determining whether a local activity will likely have a significant effect
upon interstate commerce, a court must consider, not the effect of an
individual act (a single instance of gun possession), but rather the cumulative
effect of all similar instances (i.e., the effect of all guns possessed in or
near schools). <span class=GramE>See, e.g., <span class=SpellE>Wickard</span>,
supra, at 127-128.</span> As this Court put the matter almost 50 years ago:</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>&quot;[I]t
is enough that the individual activity when multiplied into a general practice
. . . contains a threat to the interstate economy that requires preventative
regulation.&quot; <span class=GramE>Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American
Crystal Sugar Co., 334 </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  class=GramE><span>U.S.</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
class=GramE><span> 219, 236
(1948) (citations omitted).</span></span><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Third,
the Constitution requires us to judge the connection between a regulated
activity and interstate commerce, not directly, but at one remove. Courts must
give Congress a degree of leeway in determining the existence of a significant
factual connection between the regulated activity and interstate commerce--both
because the Constitution delegates the commerce power directly to Congress and
because the determination requires an empirical judgment of a kind that a
legislature is more likely than a court to make with accuracy. The traditional
words &quot;rational basis&quot; <span class=GramE>capture</span> this leeway.
See <span class=SpellE>Hodel</span>, supra, at 276-277. Thus, the specific
question before us, as the Court recognizes, is not whether the &quot;regulated
activity sufficiently affected interstate commerce,&quot; but, rather, whether
Congress could have had &quot;a rational basis&quot; for so concluding. Ante,
at 8 (emphasis added).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>I
recognize that we must judge this matter independently. &quot;[S]imply because
Congress may conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate
commerce does not necessarily make it so.&quot; <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Hodel</span></span><span class=GramE>, supra, at 311 (Rehnquist,
J., concurring in judgment).</span> And, I also recognize that Congress did not
write specific &quot;interstate commerce&quot; findings into the law under
which Lopez was convicted. Nonetheless, as I have already noted, the matter
that we review independently (i.e., whether there is a &quot;rational
basis&quot;) already has considerable leeway built into it. And, the absence of
findings, at most, deprives a statute of the benefit of some extra leeway. This
extra deference, in principle, might change the result in a close case, though,
in practice, it has not made a critical legal difference. See, e.g., <span
class=SpellE>Katzenbach</span> v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 299 (1964) (noting
that &quot;no formal findings were made, which of course are not
necessary&quot;); Perez, supra, at 156-157; cf. Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. ___, ___ (1994) (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (<span
class=GramE>slip</span> op., at 42) (&quot;Congress is not obligated, when
enacting its statutes, to make a record of the type that an administrative
agency or court does to accommodate judicial review&quot;); <span class=SpellE>Fullilove</span>
v. <span class=SpellE>Klutznick</span>, 448 U.S. 448, 503 (1980) (Powell, J.,
concurring) (&quot;After Congress has legislated repeatedly in an area of
national concern, its Members gain experience that may reduce the need for
fresh hearings or prolonged debate . . .&quot;). And, it would seem
particularly unfortunate to make the validity of the statute at hand turn on
the presence or absence of findings. <span class=GramE>Because Congress did
make findings (though not until after Lopez was prosecuted), doing so would
appear to elevate form over substance.</span> See Pub. L. 103-322, §§ 320904(2<span
class=GramE>)(</span>F), (G), 108 Stat. 2125, 18 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> C. A. §922(q)(1)(F), (G)
(Nov. 1994 Supp.).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
addition, despite the Court of Appeals' suggestion to the contrary, see 2 F. 3d
1342, 1365 (CA5 1993), there is no special need here for a clear indication of
Congress' rationale. The statute does not interfere with the exercise of state
or local authority. Cf., e.g., <span class=SpellE>Dellmuth</span> v. <span
class=SpellE>Muth</span>, 491 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 223, 227-228 (1989)
(requiring clear statement for abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity).
Moreover, any clear statement rule would apply only to determine Congress'
intended result, not to clarify the source of its authority or measure the
level of consideration that went into its decision, and here there is no doubt
as to which activities Congress intended to regulate. See ibid.; id., at 233
(Scalia, J., concurring) (to subject States to suits for money damages,
Congress need only make that intent clear, and need not refer explicitly to the
Eleventh Amendment); EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226, 243, n. 18 (1983) (Congress
need not recite the constitutional provision that authorizes its action).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Applying
these principles to the case at hand, we must ask whether Congress could have
had a rational basis for finding a significant (or substantial) connection
between gun related school violence and interstate commerce. Or, to put the
question in the language of the explicit finding that Congress made when it
amended this law in 1994: Could Congress rationally have found that
&quot;violent crime in school zones,&quot; through its effect on the
&quot;quality of education,&quot; significantly (or substantially) affects
&quot;interstate&quot; or &quot;foreign commerce&quot;? 18 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> C. A. §§922(q<span
class=GramE>)(</span>1)(F), (G) (Nov. 1994 Supp.). As long as one views the
commerce connection, not as a &quot;technical legal conception,&quot; but as
&quot;a practical one,&quot; Swift &amp; Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375,
398 (1905) (Holmes, J.), the answer to this question must be yes. Numerous
reports and studies--generated both inside and outside government--make clear
that Congress could reasonably have found the empirical connection that its
law, implicitly or explicitly, asserts. (See Appendix, infra at 19, for a
sample of the documentation, as well as for complete citations to the sources
referenced below.)</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>For
one thing, reports, hearings, and other readily available literature make clear
that the problem of guns in and around schools is widespread and extremely
serious. These materials report, for example, that four percent of American
high school students (and six percent of inner city high school students) carry
a gun to school at least occasionally, Centers for Disease Control 2342; <span
class=SpellE>Sheley</span>, McGee, &amp; Wright 679; that 12 percent of urban
high school students have had guns fired at them, ibid.; that 20 percent of
those students have been threatened with guns, ibid.; and that, in any 6 month
period, several hundred thousand schoolchildren are victims of violent crimes
in or near their schools, U. S. Dept. of Justice 1 (1989); House Select
Committee Hearing 15 (1989). And, they report that this widespread violence in
schools throughout the Nation significantly interferes with the quality of
education in those schools. See, e.g., House Judiciary Committee Hearing 44
(1990) (linking school violence to dropout rate); U. S. Dept. of Health 118-119
(1978) (school violence victims suffer academically); compare U. S. Dept. of
Justice 1 (1991) (gun violence worst in inner city schools), with National
Center 47 (dropout rates highest in inner cities). Based on reports such as
these, Congress obviously could have thought that guns and learning are
mutually exclusive. <span class=GramE>Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee Hearing 39 (1993); </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  class=GramE><span>U. S.</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
class=GramE><span> Dept. of
Health 118, 123-124 (1978).</span></span><span> And, Congress could therefore have found a
substantial educational problem--teachers unable to teach, students unable to
learn--and concluded that guns near schools contribute substantially to the
size and scope of that problem.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Having
found that guns in schools significantly undermine the quality of education in
our Nation's classrooms, Congress could also have found, given the effect of
education upon interstate and foreign commerce, that gun related violence in
and around schools is a commercial, as well as a human, problem. Education,
although far more than a matter of economics, has long been inextricably
intertwined with the Nation's economy. When this Nation began, most workers
received their education in the workplace, typically (like Benjamin Franklin)
as apprentices. See generally <span class=SpellE>Seybolt</span>; <span
class=SpellE>Rorabaugh</span>; U. S. Dept. of Labor (1950). As late as the
1920's, many workers still received general education directly from their
employers--from large corporations, such as General Electric, Ford, and
Goodyear, which created schools within their firms to help both the worker and
the firm. See <span class=SpellE>Bolino</span> 15-25. (Throughout most of the
19th century <span class=GramE>fewer</span> than one percent of all Americans
received secondary education through attending a high school. <span
class=GramE>See id., at 11.)</span> As public school enrollment grew in the
early 20th century, see Becker 218 (1993), the need for industry to teach basic
educational skills diminished. But, the direct economic link between basic
education and industrial productivity remained. Scholars estimate that nearly a
quarter of America's economic growth in the early years of this century is
traceable directly to increased schooling, see Denison 243; that investment in
&quot;human capital&quot; (through spending on education) exceeded investment
in &quot;physical capital&quot; by a ratio of almost two to one, see Schultz 26
(1961); and that the economic returns to this investment in education exceeded
the returns to conventional capital investment, see, e.g., Davis &amp; <span
class=SpellE>Morrall</span> 48-49.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In recent
years the link between secondary education and business has strengthened,
becoming both more direct and more important. Scholars on the subject report
that technological changes and innovations in management techniques have
altered the nature of the workplace so that more jobs now demand greater
educational skills. See, e.g., MIT 32 (only about one third of hand tool
company's 1,000 workers were qualified to work with a new process that requires
high school level reading and mathematical skills); <span class=SpellE>Cyert</span>
&amp; Mowery 68 (gap between wages of high school dropouts and better trained
workers increasing); U. S. Dept. of Labor 41 (1981) (job openings for dropouts
declining over time). There is evidence that &quot;service, manufacturing or
construction jobs are being displaced by technology that requires a better
educated worker or, more likely, are being exported overseas,&quot; Gordon, <span
class=SpellE>Ponticell</span>, &amp; Morgan 26; that &quot;workers with truly
few skills by the year 2000 will find that only one job out of ten will
remain,&quot; ibid.; and that</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>&quot;[o]<span
class=SpellE>ver</span> the long haul the best way to encourage the growth of
high wage jobs is to upgrade the skills of the work force. . . . [B]<span
class=SpellE>etter</span> trained workers become more productive workers,
enabling a company to become more competitive and expand.&quot; <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Henkoff</span></span><span class=GramE> 60.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Increasing
global competition also has made primary and secondary education economically
more important. The portion of the American economy attributable to
international trade nearly tripled between 1950 and 1980, and more than 70
percent of American made goods now compete with imports. Marshall 205; <span
class=GramE>Marshall &amp;</span> Tucker 33. Yet, lagging worker productivity
has contributed to negative trade balances and to real hourly compensation that
has fallen below wages in 10 other industrialized nations. </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span

&amp; <span class=SpellE>Kask</span> 28, 31.</span></span><span> At least some significant
part of this serious productivity problem is attributable to students who
emerge from classrooms without the reading or mathematical skills necessary to
compete with their European or Asian counterparts, see, e.g., MIT 28, and,
presumably, to high school dropout rates of 20 to 25 percent (up to 50 percent
in inner cities), see, e.g., National Center 47; Chubb &amp; <span
class=SpellE>Hanushek</span> 215. Indeed, Congress has said, when writing other
statutes, that &quot;functionally or technologically illiterate&quot; Americans
in the work force &quot;<span class=SpellE>erod</span>[e]&quot; our economic
&quot;standing in the international marketplace,&quot; Pub. L. 100-418, §6002(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>3), 102 Stat. 1469, and that &quot;our Nation is . . . paying
the price of scientific and technological illiteracy, with our productivity
declining, our industrial base ailing, and our global competitiveness
dwindling.&quot; H. R. Rep. No. 98-6, pt. 1, p. 19 (1983).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Finally,
there is evidence that, today more than ever, many firms base their location
decisions upon the presence, or absence, of a work force with a basic
education. <span class=GramE>See <span class=SpellE>MacCormack</span>, Newman,
&amp; <span class=SpellE>Rosenfield</span> 73; Coffee 296.</span> Scholars on
the subject report, for example, that today, &quot;[h]<span class=SpellE>igh</span>
speed communication and transportation make it possible to produce most
products and services anywhere in the world,&quot; National Center 38; that
&quot;[m]<span class=SpellE>odern</span> machinery and production methods can
therefore be combined with low wage workers to drive costs down,&quot; ibid.;
that managers can perform &quot; `back office functions anywhere in the world
now,' &quot; and say that if they &quot; `can't get enough skilled workers
here' &quot; they will &quot; `move the skilled jobs out of the country,'
&quot; id., at 41; with the consequence that &quot;rich countries need better education
and retraining, to reduce the supply of unskilled workers and to equip them
with the skills they require for tomorrow's jobs,&quot; Survey of Global
Economy 37. In light of this increased importance of education to individual
firms, it is no surprise that half of the Nation's manufacturers have become
involved with setting standards and shaping curricula for local schools, <span
class=SpellE>Maturi</span> 65-68, that 88 percent think this kind of
involvement is important, id., at 68, that more than 20 States have recently
passed educational reforms to attract new business, <span class=SpellE>Overman</span>
61-62, and that business magazines have begun to rank cities according to the
quality of their schools, see Boyle 24.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
economic links I have just sketched seem fairly obvious. Why then is it not equally
obvious, in light of those links, that a widespread, serious, and substantial
physical threat to teaching and learning also substantially threatens the
commerce to which that teaching and learning is inextricably tied? That is to
say, guns in the hands of six percent of inner city high school students and
gun related violence throughout a city's schools must threaten the trade and
commerce that those schools support. The only question, then, is whether the
latter threat is (to use the majority's terminology) &quot;substantial.&quot;
And, the evidence of (1) the extent of the gun related violence problem, see
supra, at 5, (2) the extent of the resulting negative effect on classroom
learning, see supra, at 5-6, and (3) the extent of the consequent negative
commercial effects, see supra, at 6-9, when taken together, indicate a threat
to trade and commerce that is &quot;substantial.&quot; At the very least,
Congress could rationally have concluded that the links are
&quot;substantial.&quot;</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Specifically,
Congress could have found that gun related violence near the classroom poses a
serious economic threat (1) to consequently inadequately educated workers who
must endure low paying jobs, see, e.g., National Center 29, and (2) to
communities and businesses that might (in today's &quot;information
society&quot;) otherwise gain, from a well educated work force, an important
commercial advantage, see, e.g., Becker 10 (1992), of a kind that location near
a railhead or harbor provided in the past. Congress might also have found these
threats to be no different in kind from other threats that this Court has found
within the commerce power, such as the threat that loan sharking poses to the
&quot;funds&quot; of &quot;numerous localities,&quot; Perez v. United States,
402 U. S., at 157, and that unfair labor practices pose to instrumentalities of
commerce, see Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 221-222 (1938). As
I have pointed out, supra, at 4, Congress has written that &quot;the occurrence
of violent crime in school zones&quot; has brought about a &quot;decline in the
quality of education&quot; that &quot;has an adverse impact on interstate
commerce and the foreign commerce of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>.&quot; 18 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> C. A. §§922(q<span
class=GramE>)(</span>1)(F), (G) (Nov. 1994 Supp.). The violence related facts,
the educational facts, and the economic facts, taken together, make this
conclusion rational. And, because under our case law, see supra, at 1-2; infra,
at 15, the sufficiency of the constitutionally necessary Commerce Clause link
between a crime of violence and interstate commerce turns simply upon size or
degree, those same facts make the statute constitutional.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>To
hold this statute constitutional is not to &quot;obliterate&quot; the
&quot;distinction of what is national and what is local,&quot; ante, at 18
(citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted); nor is it to hold that
the Commerce Clause permits the Federal Government to &quot;regulate any
activity that it found was related to the economic productivity of individual
citizens,&quot; to regulate &quot;marriage, divorce, and child custody,&quot;
or to regulate any and all aspects of education. Ante, at 15-16. For one thing,
this statute is aimed at curbing a particularly acute threat to the educational
process--the possession (and use) of life threatening firearms in, or near, the
classroom. <span class=GramE>The empirical evidence that I have discussed above
unmistakably documents the special way in which guns and education are
incompatible.</span> See supra, at 5-6. This Court has previously recognized
the singularly disruptive potential on interstate commerce that acts of
violence may have. See Perez, supra, at 156-157. For another thing, the
immediacy of the connection between education and the national economic well
being is documented by scholars and accepted by society at large in a way and
to a degree that may not hold true for other social institutions. It must surely
be the rare case, then, that a statute strikes at conduct that (when considered
in the abstract) seems so removed from commerce, but which (practically
speaking) has so significant an impact upon commerce.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
sum, a holding that the particular statute before us falls within the commerce
power would not expand the scope of that Clause. Rather, it simply would apply
pre-existing law to changing economic circumstances. See Heart of Atlanta
Motel, Inc. v. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, 379 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 241, 251 (1964). It would recognize
that, in today's economic world, gun related violence near the classroom makes
a significant difference to our economic, as well as our social, well being. In
accordance with well accepted precedent, such a holding would permit Congress
&quot;to act in terms of economic . . . realities,&quot; would interpret the
commerce power as &quot;an affirmative power commensurate with the national
needs,&quot; and would acknowledge that the &quot;commerce clause does not
operate so as to render the nation powerless to defend itself against economic
forces that Congress decrees inimical or destructive of the national
economy.&quot; North American Co. v. SEC, 327 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 686, 705 (1946) (citing

 >U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, at 398 (Holmes, J.)).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
majority's holding--that §922 falls outside the scope of the Commerce
Clause--creates three serious legal problems. First, the majority's holding
runs contrary to modern Supreme Court cases that have upheld congressional
actions despite connections to interstate or foreign commerce that are less
significant than the effect of school violence. In Perez v. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, supra, the Court held that
the Commerce Clause authorized a federal statute that makes it a crime to
engage in loan sharking (&quot;[e]<span class=SpellE>xtortionate</span> credit
transactions&quot;) at a local level. The Court said that Congress may judge
that such transactions, &quot;though purely <span class=GramE>intrastate, . . .</span>
affect interstate commerce.&quot; 402 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, at 154 (emphasis added).
Presumably, Congress reasoned that threatening or using force, say with a gun
on a street corner, to collect a debt occurs sufficiently often so that the
activity (by helping organized crime) affects commerce among the States. But,
why then cannot Congress also reason that the threat or use of force--the
frequent consequence of possessing a gun--in or near a school occurs
sufficiently often so that such activity (by inhibiting basic education)
affects commerce among the States? The negative impact upon the national
economy of an inability to teach basic skills seems no smaller (nor less significant)
than that of organized crime.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In <span
class=SpellE>Katzenbach</span> v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294 (1964), this Court
upheld, as within the commerce power, a statute prohibiting racial
discrimination at local restaurants, in part because that discrimination
discouraged travel by African Americans and in part because that discrimination
affected purchases of food and restaurant supplies from other States. See id.,
at 300; Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at 274 (Black, J., concurring in McClung
and in Heart of Atlanta). In Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298 (1969), this Court
found an effect on commerce caused by an amusement park located several miles
down a country road in the middle of Alabama--because some customers (the Court
assumed), some food, 15 paddleboats, and a juke box had come from out of State.
See id., at 304-305, 308. In both of these cases, the Court understood that the
specific instance of discrimination (at a local place of accommodation) was
part of a general practice that, considered as a whole, caused not only the
most serious human and social harm, but had nationally significant economic
dimensions as well. See McClung, supra, at 301; Daniel, supra, at 307, n. 10.
It is difficult to distinguish the case before us, for the same critical
elements are present. Businesses are less likely to locate in communities where
violence plagues the classroom. Families will hesitate to move to neighborhoods
where students carry guns instead of books. (Congress expressly found in 1994
that &quot;parents may decline to send their children to school&quot; in
certain areas &quot;due to concern about violent crime and gun violence.&quot;
18 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> C. A. §922(q<span
class=GramE>)(</span>1)(E) (Nov. 1994 Supp.)). And (to look at the matter in
the most narrowly commercial manner), interstate publishers therefore will sell
fewer books and other firms will sell fewer school supplies where the threat of
violence disrupts learning. Most importantly, like the local racial
discrimination at issue in McClung and Daniel, the local instances here, taken
together and considered as a whole, create a problem that causes serious human
and social harm, but also has nationally significant economic dimensions.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In <span
class=SpellE>Wickard</span> v. <span class=SpellE>Filburn</span>, 317 U.S. 111
(1942), this Court sustained the application of the Agricultural Adjustment Act
of 1938 to wheat that <span class=SpellE>Filburn</span> grew and consumed on
his own local farm because, considered in its totality, (1) home grown wheat
may be &quot;induced by rising prices&quot; to &quot;flow into the market and
check price increases,&quot; and (2) even if it never actually enters the market,
home grown wheat nonetheless &quot;supplies a need of the man who grew it which
would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market&quot; and, in that
sense, &quot;competes with wheat in commerce.&quot; </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  class=GramE><span>Id.</span></span></st1:place></st1:State><span
class=GramE><span>, at 128.</span></span><span> To find both of these
effects on commerce significant in amount, the Court had to give Congress the
benefit of the doubt. Why would the Court, to find a significant (or
&quot;substantial&quot;) effect here, have to give Congress any greater leeway?
See also United States v. Women's Sportswear Manufacturers Assn., 336 U.S. 460,
464 (1949) (&quot;If it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does
not matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze&quot;); Mandeville
Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U. S., at 236 (&quot;[I]t
is enough that the individual activity when multiplied into a general practice
. . . contains a threat to the interstate economy that requires preventative
regulation&quot;).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
second legal problem the Court creates comes from its apparent belief that it
can reconcile its holding with earlier cases by making a critical distinction
between &quot;commercial&quot; and noncommercial &quot;transaction[s].&quot;
Ante, at 12-13. That is to say, the Court believes the Constitution would
distinguish between two local activities, each of which has an identical effect
upon interstate commerce, if one, but not the other, is &quot;commercial&quot;
in nature. As a general matter, this approach fails to heed this Court's
earlier warning not to turn &quot;questions of the power of Congress&quot; upon
&quot;formula[s]&quot; that would give</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>&quot;<span
class=GramE>controlling</span> force to nomenclature such as `production' and
`indirect' and foreclose consideration of the actual effects of the activity in
question upon interstate commerce.&quot; <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Wickard</span></span><span
class=GramE>, supra, at 120.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>See
also United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 116-117 (1941) (overturning the
Court's distinction between &quot;production&quot; and &quot;commerce&quot; in
the child labor case, Hammer v. <span class=SpellE>Dagenhart</span>, 247 U.S.
251, 271-272 (1918)); Swift &amp; Co. v. United States, 196 U. S., at 398
(Holmes, J.) (&quot;[C]<span class=SpellE>ommerce</span> among the States is
not a technical legal conception, but a practical one, drawn from the course of
business&quot;). Moreover, the majority's test is not consistent with what the
Court saw as the point of the cases that the majority now characterizes.
Although the majority today attempts to categorize Perez, McClung, and <span
class=SpellE>Wickard</span> as involving intrastate &quot;economic
activity,&quot; ante, at 10-11, the Courts that decided each of those cases did
not focus upon the economic nature of the activity regulated. Rather, they
focused upon whether that activity affected interstate or foreign commerce. In
fact, the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span class=SpellE><span
 >Wickard</span></span><span
 > Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> expressly held that <span
class=SpellE>Wickard's</span> consumption of home grown wheat, &quot;though it
may not be regarded as commerce,&quot; could nevertheless be
regulated--&quot;whatever its nature&quot;--<span class=GramE>so</span> long as
&quot;it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.&quot; <span
class=SpellE>Wickard</span>, supra, at 125 (emphasis added).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>More
importantly, if a distinction between commercial and noncommercial activities
is to be made, this is not the case in which to make it. The majority clearly cannot
intend such a distinction to focus narrowly on an act of gun possession
standing by itself, for such a reading could not be reconciled with either the
civil rights cases (McClung and Daniel) or Perez--in each of those cases the
specific transaction (the race based exclusion, the use of force) was not
itself &quot;commercial.&quot; And, if the majority instead means to
distinguish generally among broad categories of activities, differentiating
what is educational from what is commercial, then, as a practical matter, the
line becomes almost impossible to draw. Schools that teach reading, writing,
mathematics, and related basic skills serve both social and commercial
purposes, and one cannot easily separate the one from the other. American
industry itself has been, and is again, involved in teaching. See supra, at 6,
9. When, and to what extent, does its involvement make education commercial?
Does the number of vocational classes that train students directly for jobs
make a difference? Does it matter if the school is public or private, nonprofit
or profit seeking? Does it matter if a city or State adopts a voucher plan that
pays private firms to run a school? Even if one were to ignore these practical
questions, why should there be a theoretical distinction between education,
when it significantly benefits commerce, and environmental pollution, when it
causes economic harm? <span class=GramE>See <span class=SpellE>Hodel</span> v.
Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  class=GramE><span>U.S.</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
class=GramE><span> 264
(1981).</span></span><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Regardless,
if there is a principled distinction that could work both here and in future
cases, Congress (even in the absence of vocational classes, industry
involvement, and private management) could rationally conclude that schools
fall on the commercial side of the line. In 1990, the year Congress enacted the
statute before us, primary and secondary schools spent $230 billion--that is,
nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars--which accounts for a significant
portion of our $5.5 trillion Gross Domestic Product for that year. See
Statistical Abstract 147, 442 (1993). The business of schooling requires
expenditure of these funds on student transportation, food and custodial
services, books, and teachers' salaries. See </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> Dept. of Education 4, 7
(1993). And, these expenditures enable schools to provide a valuable service--namely,
to equip students with the skills they need to survive in life and, more
specifically, in the workplace. Certainly, Congress has often analyzed school
expenditure as if it were a commercial investment, closely analyzing whether
schools are efficient, whether they justify the significant resources they
spend, and whether they can be restructured to achieve greater returns. See,
e.g., S. Rep. No. 100-222, p. 2 (1987) (federal school assistance is &quot;a
prudent investment&quot;); Senate Appropriations Committee Hearing (1994)
(private sector management of public schools); cf. Chubb &amp; Moe 185-229
(school choice); <span class=SpellE>Hanushek</span> 85-122 (performance based
incentives for educators); Gibbs (decision in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span
 >Hartford</span></st1:City><span
>, </span><st1:State><span
 >Conn.</span></st1:State></st1:place><span>, to contract out public
school system). Why could Congress, for Commerce Clause purposes, not consider
schools as roughly analogous to commercial investments from which the Nation
derives the benefit of an educated work force?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
third legal problem created by the Court's holding is that it threatens legal
uncertainty in an area of law that, until this case, seemed reasonably well
settled. Congress has enacted many statutes (more than 100 sections of the
United States Code), including criminal statutes (at least 25 sections), that
use the words &quot;affecting commerce&quot; to define their scope, see, e.g.,
18 U.S.C. § 844(<span class=SpellE>i</span>) (destruction of buildings used in
activity affecting interstate commerce), and other statutes that contain no
jurisdictional language at all, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 922(o<span class=GramE>)(</span>1)
(possession of machine guns). Do these, or similar, statutes regulate
noncommercial activities? If so, would that alter the meaning of
&quot;affecting commerce&quot; in a jurisdictional element? Cf. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> v. <span class=SpellE>Staszcuk</span>,
517 F. 2d 53, 57-58 (CA7 1975) (en banc) (Stevens, J.) (<span class=GramE>evaluation</span>
of Congress' intent &quot;requires more than a consideration of the
consequences of the particular transaction&quot;). More importantly, in the
absence of a jurisdictional element, are the courts nevertheless to take <span
class=SpellE>Wickard</span>, 317 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, at 127-128, (and later
similar cases) as inapplicable, and to judge the effect of a single
noncommercial activity on interstate commerce without considering similar
instances of the forbidden conduct? However these questions are eventually
resolved, the legal uncertainty now created will restrict Congress' ability to
enact criminal laws aimed at criminal behavior that, considered problem by
problem rather than instance by instance, seriously threatens the economic, as
well as social, well being of Americans.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
sum, to find this legislation within the scope of the Commerce Clause would
permit &quot;Congress . . . to act in terms of economic . . . realities.&quot;
North American Co. v. SEC, 327 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, at 705 (citing Swift &amp;
Co. v. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, 196 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, at 398 (Holmes, J.)). It would
interpret the Clause as this Court has traditionally interpreted it, with the
exception of one wrong turn subsequently corrected. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9
Wheat., at 195 (holding that the commerce power extends &quot;to all the
external concerns of the nation, and to those internal concerns which affect
the States generally&quot;); United States v. Darby, 312 U. S., at 116-117
(&quot;The conclusion is inescapable that Hammer v. <span class=SpellE>Dagenhart</span>
[the child labor case], was a departure from the principles which have
prevailed in the interpretation of the Commerce Clause both before and since
the decision . . . . It should be and now is overruled&quot;). Upholding this
legislation would do no more than simply recognize that Congress had a
&quot;rational basis&quot; for finding a significant connection between guns in
or near schools and (through their effect on education) the interstate and
foreign commerce they threaten. For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment
of the Court of Appeals. Respectfully, I dissent.</span></p>

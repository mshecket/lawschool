        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Hibbs sued the Nevada Department of Human Resources, alleging that
          they violated the Family and Medical Leave Act. The federal district
          court awarded summary judgment to the Department, saying that the
          claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and not allowed by the
          Fourteenth Amendment. The federal government intervened to defend the
          constitutionality of the statute, and the Ninth Circuit reversed. The
          Department appealed to the Supreme Court.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b

          Can Congress constitutionally authorize individuals to sue states
          underIs the FMLA a constitutional use of congressional power under the
          Eleventh Amendment and � 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment?</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Congress may enact remedial legislation when it is �congruent and
          proportional� to the constitutional violation it is attempting to
          remedy.</span

        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Court seems to say that Congress effectively has more power to
          remedy forms of discrimination that the Court would give heightened
          scrutiny than those forms of discrimination that the Court would give
          less scrutiny. This is how they distinguish the present case from

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Garrett</i>, where the statutes
          involved classifications that receive less scrutiny. In those cases,
          the Court found that the response of Congress was not �congruent and
          proportional� and thus it ran afoul of the Eleventh Amendment.</span

        <span
          >Three justices concur, stating that they would find the FMLA
          constitutional under � 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment without regard to
          the Eleventh Amendment. They would basically give Congress more
          deference.</span

        <span
          >Stevens writes a separate concurrence and says that on the face of
          the text of the Eleventh Amendment, states are only immune from suit
          by citizens of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">other </i>states, not citizens
          of their own state. Stevens feels that making the state immune from
          suit by its <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">own</i> citizens is
          kind of a �common law� addition that Congress has the power to
          abrogate by legislation.</span

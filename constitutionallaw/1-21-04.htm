          irrelevant. What Congress wants here is to regulate the camera and
          film in interstate commerce. Congress wants to regulate the camera and
          film such that they�re not used to make child pornography. It�s clear
          that Congress can regulate the camera and film in a lot of other ways
          if these items are going to move in interstate commerce. So why can�t
          the government also say that we don�t want these items doing something
          obnoxious? Couldn�t the government say that you can take whatever
          pictures you want, but just not with something that�s moved in
          interstate commerce?</span

          Justice, have to say that the Commerce Clause power is completely

        <span
          >Foley says we genuinely have no idea how the U.S. Supreme Court would
          decide this case, and if we think we do, that�s probably a danger

      <p>
        <span
          >What Foley thinks will motivate O�Connor or Kennedy would be
          something along the following lines: How important is it that we allow
          Congress to have this power? Is this something we
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">should</i> let Congress do? On
          the other hand, how important is it that we
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">deny</i> Congress this power in
          order to preserve some state autonomy in our �dual system�. What cuts
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in favor</i> of having Congress
          and the federal government win power in this case is that the Supreme
          Court has already noted a stopping point. The very existence of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="unitedstatesvlopez.htm">Lopez</a> </i
          >and

          show that there is a limit, and therefore the Supreme Court can allow
          Congress to deal with a national problem without worrying about their
          power going too far.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One of the reasons that this case is important is that the picture is
          not fungible with other pictures the way wheat is fungible. But Foley
          claims this is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">commodity </i>case instead of
          an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">activity</i> case. So the
          Supreme Court might find that Congress can have authority to regulate
          this <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">commodity</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Another argument that could be made on behalf of McCoy is the
          �traditional state domain� argument. The Court talks about education,
          family law, and family relations as areas that we traditionally look
          to state law to decide. When Congress writes a new law in that area,
          we have the danger of having Congress usurping that authority. We let
          Congress rule when they�re in their domain, but we should not expand
          Congress�s power into areas that especially intrude on state
          sovereignty.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Because
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"

          >
          involves a parent-child relationship, it helps to make the argument
          that the issue belongs to state law. If McCoy has been a bad parent,
          maybe </span

            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">California</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span>
          law should tell us what should be done with her. Maybe we don�t want
          Congress to set up a nationwide standard for what it means to be a
          good parent. We don�t want the states deprived of their ability to
          administer family law differently in each state. We like having each
          state go its own way on cultural issues and social values and mores.
          This is how Foley would set out the argument in order to make it
          attractive to O�Connor or Kennedy.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The key idea is that the argument is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">functional</i> argument. We
          could try to measure �substantial effects�, but ultimately, the
          justices are in the driver�s seat. What will move them is not a
          formalistic and technical argument, but an argument about
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">function</i> and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">purpose</i>. The justices,
          according to Foley, want to hear a reason
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">why</i> we should give Congress
          the power we give them.</span

          over. It�s going to be roughly a 48 hour exam for that time period.
          There will be three essay questions. We will be able to use books and
          notes. How can we plan for this? Foley says if we have been keeping up
          with the reading, that is just about the best preparation you can
          muster until you get the questions themselves. There is no point in
          trying to memorize details of things until you get a specific
          question. But if you haven�t been doing the reading, it�s going to be
          a lot harder. You need the basic concepts in order to be able to
          tackle the questions in 48 hours.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >It�s not hard to figure out what sort of questions will be on the
          exam. We learned about (1) Federalism, (2) Separation of Powers, (3)
          equality (the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and
          the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment), and (4) substantive
          due process. Be prepared to write a brief, or at least the summary of
          argument section. We might be asked to argue for both sides as a brief
          writer. We might also be asked to write a bench memo to a judge to
          advise a judge on how to rule on a case. We may be asked to play the
          role of a judge. We may be asked to write a memo advising a client
          about the constitutionality of certain conduct or legislation. Don�t
          worry about the Bluebook for this exam. If the date of the case is
          important to your argument, you might want to mention the date of the
          case even if that�s not what the Bluebook says. The most important

        <b><span>More on � 5</span></b>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Yesterday, we went pretty fast but got the essence of comparing
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Morrison </i>and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="nevadadepartmentofhumanresourcesvhibbs.htm">Hibbs</a></i
          >. In Foley�s lingo, the new test under � 5 is the �too far� test�has
          Congress just gone overboard, or is the statute narrowly tailored and
          circumscribed enough? If you have a � 5 problem, you should ask if
          Congress has gone too far, or if it�s close enough. Inevitably, that�s
          an indefinite standard that can only be understood in relation to
          cases the Court has already decided. The other
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">key point</i> is that Congress
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">can </i>have over � 5 to impose
          standards that are not themselves required by � 1. The failure to
          provide 12 weeks of leave, for example, is not a violation of � 1, but
          Congress has the power to impose 12 weeks of leave under � 5.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The most important thing to understand is that the reason we�re
          getting so much more litigation under � 5 in the last decade is
          because of two developments related to federalism: (1) The shrinking
          of the Commerce Clause. You wouldn�t have to worry about a � 5 issue
          if the sky was the limit of the Commerce Clause. That�s why � 5 comes
          up in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Morrison</i>, because
          they found a lack of authority under the Commerce Clause. For 60 years
          after the New Deal revolution, the Court had not found any Commerce
          Clause problems until the arrival of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lopez</i>. The new � 5 stuff is
          part of the revitalization of the �New Federalism�. Another aspect of
          federalism is the new Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity, which is
          a new development that also occurred in the 1990s. This new sovereign
          immunity doctrine that started with
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Seminole Tribe</i> says that
          Congress cannot override sovereign immunity using Commerce Clause
          power, which forces you to look at � 5. Five years ago, it wasn�t
          necessary to teach � 5 in a first year Con Law class!</span

          >Part of the reason we�re reading these briefs is to look at how you

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s under review here is the Second Circuit�s decision. Since the
          Second Circuit said that the President lacked authority, the Court
          need not come to the rights question until it�s finished with dealing
          with whether the Second Circuit was correct or incorrect on the power
          issue. And what about habeas jurisdiction? That may be important to
          the Supreme Court, but we haven�t spent any time on it in this class.
          Don�t worry about that and where the case should be filed. We should
          focus on the power question. Does the President
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">have power</i> either by virtue
          of the Constitution or by virtue of statutory authority and Justice
          Jackson�s analysis in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Youngstown Sheet</i>? We also
          need to think about the rights issue, at least in the back of our
          minds. Now that we know a little bit about substantive due process,
          there seems to be a substantive due process issue on the table
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">if </i>you get over the initial
          power hurdle.</span

          tried to tell us what the relationship is between the President and
          Congress with respect to the President�s actions. The question here
          is: when the President issued the order to detain Padilla, is he
          acting (1)
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >with the authority of Congress</i
          >, (2)
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >against the authority of Congress</i
          >, or (3)
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >in the absence of any indication from Congress</i
          >? The government�s position is that Congress has given the President
          express permission to detain people in the authorization for the use
          of force. But the government goes on to claim that the President has
          the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">inherent</i> power to
          detain Padilla.</span

Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech) in the fall of 1994. In
September of that year, Brzonkala met respondents Antonio Morrison and James
Crawford, who were both students at Virginia Tech and members of its varsity
football team. Brzonkala alleges that, within 30 minutes of meeting Morrison
and Crawford, they assaulted and repeatedly raped her. After the attack,
Morrison allegedly told Brzonkala, &quot;You better not have any ...
diseases.&quot; Complaint ¶ ;22. In the months following the rape, Morrison
also allegedly announced in the dormitory's dining room that he &quot;like[d]
to get girls drunk and ... .&quot; Id., ¶ ;31. The omitted portions, quoted

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span

her to become severely emotionally disturbed and depressed. She sought
assistance from a university psychiatrist, who prescribed antidepressant
medication. Shortly after the rape Brzonkala stopped attending classes and
withdrew from the university.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>In early 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint
against respondents under Virginia Tech's Sexual Assault Policy. During the
school-conducted hearing on her complaint, Morrison admitted having sexual
contact with her despite the fact that she had twice told him &quot;no.&quot;
After the hearing, Virginia Tech's Judicial Committee found insufficient
evidence to punish Crawford, but found Morrison guilty of sexual assault and
sentenced him to immediate suspension for two semesters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Virginia Tech's dean of students upheld
the judicial committee's sentence. However, in July 1995, Virginia Tech
informed Brzonkala that Morrison intended to initiate a court challenge to his
conviction under the Sexual Assault Policy. University officials told her that
a second hearing would be necessary to remedy the school's error in prosecuting
her complaint under that policy, which had not been widely circulated to
students. The university therefore conducted a second hearing under its Abusive
Conduct Policy, which was in force prior to the dissemination of the Sexual
Assault Policy. Following this second hearing the Judicial Committee again
found Morrison guilty and sentenced him to an identical 2-semester suspension.
This time, however, the description of Morrison's offense was, without
explanation, changed from &quot;sexual assault&quot; to &quot;using abusive
language.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

through the university's administrative system. On August 21, 1995, Virginia
Tech's senior vice president and provost set aside Morrison's punishment. She
concluded that it was &quot; `excessive when compared with other cases where
there has been a finding of violation of the Abusive Conduct Policy,' &quot;
132 F. 3d 950, 955 (CA4 1997). Virginia Tech did not inform Brzonkala of this
decision. After learning from a newspaper that Morrison would be returning to
Virginia Tech for the fall 1995 semester, she dropped out of the university.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Crawford, and Virginia Tech in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Virginia. Her complaint alleged that Morrison's and Crawford's
attack violated §13981 and that Virginia Tech's handling of her complaint
violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373-375, 20 U.
S. C. §§1681-1688. Morrison and Crawford moved to dismiss this complaint on the
grounds that it failed to state a claim and that §13981's civil remedy is
unconstitutional. The United States, petitioner in No. 99-5, intervened to
defend §13981's constitutionality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Title IX claims against Virginia Tech for failure to state a claim upon which

935 F. Supp. 772 (WD Va. 1996). It then held that Brzonkala's complaint stated
a claim against Morrison and Crawford under §13981, but dismissed the complaint
because it concluded that Congress lacked authority to enact the section under
either the Commerce Clause or §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Brzonkala v.

opinion and reheard the case en banc. The en banc court then issued an opinion
affirming the District Court's conclusion that Brzonkala stated a claim under
§13981 because her complaint alleged a crime of violence and the allegations of
Morrison's crude and derogatory statements regarding his treatment of women
sufficiently indicated that his crime was motivated by gender animus.2
Nevertheless, the court by a divided vote affirmed the District Court's
conclusion that Congress lacked constitutional authority to enact §13981's
civil remedy. Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 169 F. 3d 820

activities.&quot; 514 U. S., at 558 (citing Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S.

regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,

decision in that case. See, e.g., id., at 551 (&quot;The Act [does not]
regulat[e] a commercial activity&quot;), 560 (&quot;Even Wickard, which is
perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over

part on the fact that the link between gun possession and a substantial effect
on interstate commerce was attenuated. Id., at 563-567. The United States
argued that the possession of guns may lead to violent crime, and that violent
crime &quot;can be expected to affect the functioning of the national economy
in two ways. First, the costs of violent crime are substantial, and, through
the mechanism of insurance, those costs are spread throughout the population.
Second, violent crime reduces the willingness of individuals to travel to areas
within the country that are perceived to be unsafe.&quot; Id., at 563-564
(citation omitted). The Government also argued that the presence of guns at
schools poses a threat to the educational process, which in turn threatens to
produce a less efficient and productive workforce, which will negatively affect
national productivity and thus interstate commerce. Ibid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span

crime&quot; and &quot;national productivity&quot; arguments because they would
permit Congress to &quot;regulate not only all violent crime, but all
activities that might lead to violent crime, regardless of how tenuously they
relate to interstate commerce.&quot; Id., at 564. We noted that, under this
but-for reasoning:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span

that it found was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens:
family law (including marriage, divorce, and child custody), for example. Under
the[se] theories ... , it is difficult to perceive any limitation on federal
power, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where States
historically have been sovereign. Thus, if we were to accept the Government's
arguments, we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual that
Congress is without power to regulate.&quot; Ibid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Commerce Clause jurisprudence as reference points, the proper resolution of the
present cases is clear. Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any
sense of the phrase, economic activity. While we need not adopt a categorical
rule against aggregating the effects of any noneconomic activity in order to
decide these cases, thus far in our Nation's history our cases have upheld
Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is
economic in nature. See, e.g., id., at 559-560, and the cases cited therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

issue in Lopez, §13981 contains no jurisdictional element establishing that the
federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress' power to regulate interstate
commerce. Although Lopez makes clear that such a jurisdictional element would
lend support to the argument that §13981 is sufficiently tied to interstate
commerce, Congress elected to cast §13981's remedy over a wider, and more
purely intrastate, body of violent crime.5<o:p></o:p></span></p>

findings that we faced in Lopez, §13981 is supported by numerous findings
regarding the serious impact that gender-motivated violence has on victims and
their families. See, e.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, p. 385 (1994); S. Rep.

sufficient, by itself, to sustain the constitutionality of Commerce Clause
legislation. As we stated in Lopez, &quot; `[S]imply because Congress may
conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce
does not necessarily make it so.' &quot; 514 U. S., at 557, n. 2 (quoting
Hodel, 452 U. S., at 311 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment)). Rather,
&quot; `[w]hether particular operations affect interstate commerce sufficiently
to come under the constitutional power of Congress to regulate them is
ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question, and can be settled
finally only by this Court.' &quot; 514 U. S., at 557, n. 2 (quoting Heart of

substantially weakened by the fact that they rely so heavily on a method of

expressed in Lopez that Congress might use the Commerce Clause to completely
obliterate the Constitution's distinction between national and local authority
seems well founded. See Lopez, supra, at 564. The reasoning that petitioners
advance seeks to follow the but-for causal chain from the initial occurrence of
violent crime (the suppression of which has always been the prime object of the
States' police power) to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce. If
accepted, petitioners' reasoning would allow Congress to regulate any crime as
long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects
on employment, production, transit, or consumption. Indeed, if Congress may
regulate gender-motivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or any
other type of violence since gender-motivated violence, as a subset of all
violent crime, is certain to have lesser economic impacts than the larger class
of which it is a part.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>omy is undoubtedly
significant. Congress may have recognized this specter when it expressly precluded
§13981 from being used in the family law context.6 See 42 U. S. C.
§13981(e)(4). Under our written Constitution, however, the limitation of
congressional authority is not solely a matter of legislative grace.7 See

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>We accordingly reject the argument that
Congress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on
that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce. The Constitution
requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.
Lopez, 514 U. S., at 568 (citing Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel, 301 U. S., at 30).
In recognizing this fact we preserve one of the few principles that has been
consistent since the Clause was adopted. The regulation and punishment of
intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities, channels, or
goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the
States. See, e.g., Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 426, 428 (1821) (Marshall,
C. J.) (stating that Congress &quot;has no general right to punish murder
committed within any of the States,&quot; and that it is &quot;clear ... that
congress cannot punish felonies generally&quot;). Indeed, we can think of no
better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National
Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and
vindication of its victims.8 See, e.g., Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566 (&quot;The
Constitution ... withhold[s] from Congress a plenary police power&quot;); id.,
at 584-585 (Thomas, J., concurring) (&quot;[W]e always have rejected readings

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>This Court has long held that only the
interstate commercial effects, not the local nature of the cause, are
constitutionally relevant. See NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.
S. 1, 38-39 (1937) (focusing upon interstate effects); Wickard v. Filburn, 317
U. S. 111, 125 (1942) (aggregating interstate effects of wheat grown for home
consumption); Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at 258 (&quot; `[I]f it is
interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how local the
operation which applies the squeeze' &quot; (quoting United States v. Women's
Sportswear Mfrs. Assn., 336 U. S. 460, 464 (1949))). Nothing in the
Constitution's language, or that of earlier cases prior to Lopez, explains why
the Court should ignore one highly relevant characteristic of an
interstate-commerce-affecting cause (how &quot;local&quot; it is), while
placing critical constitutional weight upon a different, less obviously
relevant, feature (how &quot;economic&quot; it is).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

seem unlikely to help secure the very object that they seek, namely, the protection
of &quot;areas of traditional state regulation&quot; from federal intrusion.
Ante, at 15. The Court's rules, even if broadly interpreted, are
underinclusive. The local pickpocket is no less a traditional subject of state
regulation than is the local gender-motivated assault. Regardless, the Court
reaffirms, as it should, Congress' well-established and frequently exercised
power to enact laws that satisfy a commerce-related jurisdictional
prerequisite--for example, that some item relevant to the federally regulated
activity has at some time crossed a state line. Ante, at 8-9, 11, 13, and n. 5;
Lopez, supra, at 558; Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at 256 (&quot; `[T]he
authority of Congress to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from
immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained, and is no longer open
to question' &quot; (quoting Caminetti v. United States, 242 U. S. 470, 491
(1917))); see also United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347-350 (1971) (saving
ambiguous felon-in-possession statute by requiring gun to have crossed state
line); Scarborough v. United States, 431 U. S. 563, 575 (1977) (interpreting
same statute to require only that gun passed &quot;in interstate commerce&quot;
&quot;at some time,&quot; without questioning constitutionality); cf., e.g., 18
U. S. C. §2261(a)(1) (making it a federal crime for a person to cross state
lines to commit a crime of violence against a spouse or intimate partner);
§1951(a) (federal crime to commit robbery, extortion, physical violence or
threat thereof, where &quot;article or commodity in commerce&quot; is affected,
obstructed or delayed); §2315 (making unlawful the knowing receipt or
possession of certain stolen items that have &quot;crossed a State ...
boundary&quot;); §922(g)(1) (prohibiting felons from shipping, transporting,
receiving, or possessing firearms &quot;in interstate ... commerce&quot;).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>And in a world where most everyday
products or their component parts cross interstate boundaries, Congress will
frequently find it possible to redraft a statute using language that ties the
regulation to the interstate movement of some relevant object, thereby
regulating local criminal activity or, for that matter, family affairs. See,
e.g., Child Support Recovery Act of 1992, 18 U. S. C. §228. Although this
possibility does not give the Federal Government the power to regulate
everything, it means that any substantive limitation will apply randomly in
terms of the interests the majority seeks to protect. How much would be gained,
for example, were Congress to reenact the present law in the form of &quot;An Act
Forbidding Violence Against Women Perpetrated at Public Accommodations or by
Those Who Have Moved in, or through the Use of Items that Have Moved in,
Interstate Commerce&quot;? Complex Commerce Clause rules creating fine
distinctions that achieve only random results do little to further the
important federalist interests that called them into being. That is why modern
(pre-Lopez) case law rejected them. See Wickard, supra, at 120; United States
v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 116-117 (1941); Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.,
supra, at 37.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>The majority, aware of these difficulties,
is nonetheless concerned with what it sees as an important contrary
consideration. To determine the lawfulness of statutes simply by asking whether
Congress could reasonably have found that aggregated local instances
significantly affect interstate commerce will allow Congress to regulate almost
anything. Virtually all local activity, when instances are aggregated, can have
&quot;substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption.&quot;
Hence Congress could &quot;regulate any crime,&quot; and perhaps
&quot;marriage, divorce, and childrearing&quot; as well, obliterating the
&quot;Constitution's distinction between national and local authority.&quot;
Ante, at 15; Lopez, 514 U. S., at 558; cf. A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.
United States, 295 U. S. 495, 548 (1935) (need for distinction between
&quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; effects lest there &quot;be
virtually no limit to the federal power&quot;); Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S.
251, 276 (1918) (similar observation).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>This consideration, however, while
serious, does not reflect a jurisprudential defect, so much as it reflects a
practical reality. We live in a Nation knit together by two centuries of
scientific, technological, commercial, and environmental change. Those changes,
taken together, mean that virtually every kind of activity, no matter how
local, genuinely can affect commerce, or its conditions, outside the State--at
least when considered in the aggregate. Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U. S., at
251. And that fact makes it close to impossible for courts to develop
meaningful subject-matter categories that would exclude some kinds of local
activities from ordinary Commerce Clause &quot;aggregation&quot; rules without,
at the same time, depriving Congress of the power to regulate activities that
have a genuine and important effect upon interstate commerce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

&quot;defect&quot; means that, within the bounds of the rational, Congress, not
the courts, must remain primarily responsible for striking the appropriate
state/federal balance. Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,

legislates, &quot;the normal operation of the legislative process itself would
adequately defend state interests from undue infringement&quot;); see also
Kramer, Putting the Politics Back into the Political Safeguards of Federalism,
100 Colum. L. Rev. 215 (2000) (focusing on role of political process and
political parties in protecting state interests). Congress is institutionally
motivated to do so. Its Members represent state and local district interests.
They consider the views of state and local officials when they legislate, and
they have even developed formal procedures to ensure that such consideration
takes place. See, e.g., Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-4,
109 Stat. 48 (codified in scattered sections of 2 U. S. C.). Moreover, Congress
often can better reflect state concerns for autonomy in the details of
sophisticated statutory schemes than can the judiciary, which cannot easily
gather the relevant facts and which must apply more general legal rules and
categories. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §7543(b) (Clean Air Act); 33 U. S. C. §1251
et seq. (Clean Water Act); see also New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,
167-168 (1992) (collecting other examples of &quot;cooperative
federalism&quot;). Not surprisingly, the bulk of American law is still state
law, and overwhelmingly so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

enacted the statute, followed procedures that help to protect the federalism
values at stake. It provided adequate notice to the States of its intent to
legislate in an &quot;are[a] of traditional state regulation.&quot; Ante, at
15. And in response, attorneys general in the overwhelming majority of States
(38) supported congressional legislation, telling Congress that &quot;[o]ur

violence against women is a national one, requiring federal attention, federal
leadership, and federal funds.&quot; Id., at 34-36; see also Violence<o:p></o:p></span></p>

out, Congress compiled a &quot;mountain of data&quot; explicitly documenting
the interstate commercial effects of gender-motivated crimes of violence. Ante,
at 2-8, 27-28 (dissenting opinion). After considering alternatives, it focused
the federal law upon documented deficiencies in state legal systems. And it
tailored the law to prevent its use in certain areas of traditional state
concern, such as divorce, alimony, or child custody. 42 U. S. C. §13981(e)(4).
Consequently, the law before us seems to represent an instance, not of
state/federal conflict, but of state/federal efforts to cooperate in order to
help solve a mutually acknowledged national problem. Cf. §§300w-10, 3796gg,
3796hh, 10409, 13931 (providing federal moneys to encourage state and local
initiatives to combat gender-motivated violence).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

process leading up to enactment of this statute because, as the majority
recognizes, ante, at 14, it far surpasses that which led to the enactment of
the statute we considered in Lopez. And even were I to accept Lopez as an
accurate statement of the law, which I do not, that distinction provides a
possible basis for upholding the law here. This Court on occasion has pointed
to the importance of procedural limitations in keeping the power of Congress in
check. See Garcia, supra, at 554 (&quot;Any substantive restraint on the
exercise of Commerce Clause powers must find its justification in the
procedural nature of this basic limitation, and it must be tailored to
compensate for possible failings in the national political process rather than
to dictate a `sacred province of state autonomy' &quot; (quoting EEOC v.
Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 236 (1983))); see also Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.
452, 460-461 (1991) (insisting upon a &quot;plain statement&quot; of congressional
intent when Congress legislates &quot;in areas traditionally regulated by the
States&quot;); cf. Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 103-105, 114-117

thoroughness of legislative procedures--e.g., whether Congress took a
&quot;hard look&quot;--might sometimes make a determinative difference in a
Commerce Clause case, say when Congress legislates in an area of traditional
state regulation. See, e.g., Jackson, Federalism and the Uses and Limits of
Law: Printz and Principle?, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 2180, 2231-2245 (1998); Gardbaum,

for similar limitation in respect to somewhat analogous principle of
subsidiarity for European Community); Gardbaum, supra, at 833-837 (applying
subsidiarity principles to American federalism). Of course, any judicial
insistence that Congress follow particular procedures might itself intrude upon
congressional prerogatives and embody difficult definitional problems. But the
intrusion, problems, and consequences all would seem less serious than those
embodied in the majority's approach. See supra, at 2-7.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recognize that the law in this area is unstable and that time and experience
may demonstrate both the unworkability of the majority's rules and the
superiority of Congress' own procedural approach--in which case the law may

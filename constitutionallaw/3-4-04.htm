        ><span>
          It�s probably the single most important assignment of the semester in
          terms of analytic or conceptual framework. We�ll be talking about the
          basic concept of equal protection for the Equal Protection Clause.
          There are ideas of laws being
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">over</i>- or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">under</i>-inclusive, and we
          have a reading from Chemerinsky on those concepts. If there�s one
          assignment to devote extra energy to, it�s this one.</span

          in relationship to Chemerinsky? Pay more attention to Chemerinsky. On
          Monday, we want to get the analytic framework. We�re only look at
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Beazer</i></span
          ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </i>as an application of the

          >To what degree do justices change their own minds? The justices feel
          the weight and pressure of the arguments on both sides of an issue.
          They can get tipped to one side of an issue only to get tipped back to
          the other side later on. Justices can change their minds well into the
          deliberation of the case.</span

        <b><span>More on the political question doctrine</span></b

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about these lawsuits at the time of the Vietnam War? People
          filed lawsuits saying that the war was illegal and unconstitutional
          because it was undeclared. The court would not judge this issue
          because they felt that it was a political question. In fact, this is
          the quintessential political question doctrine situation.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But what if someone was being sent to prison for resisting the draft
          for an undeclared war? Wouldn�t there be personal consequences to that
          individual? Would it still be a political question? Why would the
          Supreme Court say that they�re not going to decide what the
          Constitution means even though they�re being asked to do so by
          individuals who may end up in jail? It�s not
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">enough</i> to say that it is
          relevant whether the Court has in front of it an issue of rights or an
          issue of powers. The Court is less willing to get involved in a turf
          battle between branches. The presence of a rights question is not
          dispositive in deciding whether the Court will tackle the question.
          That�s just one factor. Another factor is whether the Court feels that
          another branch of government has more expertise on the subject at
          hand.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Another famous political question case was the �Pentagon Papers�
          case. The New York Times published some documents about the Vietnam
          War. The government went to court to stop the newspaper from
          publishing the papers, arguing that it would be a serious breach of
          national security. The government invoked the political question
          doctrine in this case. They said that the documents were classified
          and should not be released. Instead, the Court decided to protect the
          freedom of the press. In that case, they felt that the Court must
          interpret the Constitution to allow the New York Times to publish the
          information.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How do we explain the difference between the two types of cases? The
          Court may not feel that they have
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">military </i>expertise, but
          they do feel like the guardians of fundamental personal liberties.
          What they won�t decide in the war powers context is whether the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">war itself</i> is permissible
          or impermissible. They won�t get into the question of whether the
          president can send troops overseas without congressional
          authorization.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >It�s hard to figure out when they will intervene; we have no
          definitive rule.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Isn�t <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">everything</i> in some
          sense a political question? One of the biggest debates over whether
          the Court should invoke the political question doctrine has come up in
          the case of <span class="GramE">gerrymandering/redistricting</span>.
          There have always been claims that the ways those boundaries get drawn
          violate equal protection. Is this a political question? Or is it the
          Court�s role to protect against discrimination? The court could go
          either way on this.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >As a practical matter, when you have constitutional litigation, you
          must ask yourself whether the court could possibly decide to invoke
          the political question doctrine in this case, even if it hasn�t done
          so previously. Is there a possibly that the political question
          doctrine could be in play, even though on the surface of the
          precedents you wouldn�t normally think that it was in play.
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Any</i> constitutional question
          could be considered a political question, but most of them are
          not.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What about the case of Judge Nixon? The Court said that it
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">could</i> decide when it�s
          proper to use the impeachment power or not and decide what the phrase
          �high crimes and misdemeanors� means, but they feel that this is a
          case they shouldn�t decide because decisions about the impeachment
          power belong exclusively to Congress.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court is going to think in practical terms. �What would this mean
          for the country if we, the Court, decided this question?� Should
          drawing district lines be subject to judicial management?
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>The issue of remedies is
          important. Sometimes you lose sight of the consequence when you look
          at the question to be decided. But the courts, as practical
          institutions, will be thinking: what�s the remedial consequence of
          deciding this constitutional question?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Are there remedies less extreme than invoking the political question
          doctrine? Can courts address an issue but impose some limitations on
          their own remedial authority? What about equitable jurisdiction?
          Equitable remedies, like injunctions and orders, are thought to be
          somewhat discretionary on the part of the court issuing them. A court
          could address a question on the merits but delay or limit their
          remedy. Always think about the remedy issue. How burdensome does the
          court think the remedy will be? The Court can soften the implications
          of its decisions by manipulating its remedial power.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Cheney</i>, what was sought
          was a writ of mandamus. Should we give this remedy?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Virtually every law professor in the country when
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bush v. Gore</i> was going on
          thought that the Court would find a way to duck the issue. But they
          actually granted cert
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">twice</i>. They can manipulate
          their own agenda and their own docket when they want to. They will
          make strategic judgments as to the grant or denial of cert.</span

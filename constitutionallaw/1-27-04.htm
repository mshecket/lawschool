      <p>
        <span
          >This is one of the reasons that the Tenth Amendment is so difficult.
          The Court has been really inconsistent over time, even in recent
          years. The current view of the Tenth Amendment is that it�s an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">entirely separate question</i>,
          analytically distinct from the �power� question. But that hasn�t
          always been the Court�s view. The Court has flipped and flopped, back
          and forth again. We�ll focus on the era from 1968 (<span
            class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Wirtz</i></span
          >) to the present. There were several cases involving the Fair Labor
          Standards Act, which was passed pursuant to the Commerce Clause. After
          the New Deal, the Court said that Congress could regulate wages and
          hours and all that kind of stuff in all sorts of industries. Congress
          was given general authority to do things like set the minimum wage for
          people who work at McDonald�s.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Congress passed a minimum wage law that is generally applicable to
          all sorts of kinds of workers. They extended the same law to people
          who work for state and local agencies. There are a few exceptions, but
          most people who work for state or local governments must earn a
          certain minimum wage. Congress says that these workers� wages and
          salaries affect the interstate labor market.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In

        ><span>
          said that Congress may have Commerce Clause power over workers in the
          state, but that Congress can�t regulate state workers. The Court
          disagreed, saying that there is no separate question. If Congress has
          the Commerce Clause power, then the Tenth Amendment is satisfied. The
          Court basically said it was two ways to ask the same question. The
          Tenth Amendment was declared to be redundant to the Commerce
          Clause.</span

            >Maryland v. <span class="SpellE">Wirtz</span></i
          >. It was exactly the same question! The issue was the wages and
          salaries of state employees, but the Court came to the opposite
          conclusion.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Garcia v. San Antonio MTA </i
          >in 1985, the Court reversed again! The Court said that the federal
          government could regulate the salaries of private bus drivers, like
          Greyhound drivers, and that the federal government could also set
          minimum wages for public bus drivers.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Garcia</i> was not explicitly

          case related to the transport of radioactive waste. As a practical
          matter, this case overruled
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Garcia</i>. The Court was
          embarrassed to admit it. Also, the </span

          case covered an environmental law, not a labor law. So
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Garcia </i>is out the window,
          and we�re in a new era of the separate inquiry.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But we don�t yet know the �contours� of this separate inquiry. The

      <p>
        <span
          >So the issue in the labor law cases was whether the federal
          government can force states and state agencies to pay their workers a
          certain minimum wage. Twice the Court said yes, and once the Court
          said no. But this isn�t about �commandeering�.</span

        <span
          >When <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Garcia </i>was decided in
          1985 and Rehnquist is on the losing side, he writes a dissent
          basically saying �We�ll be back! You haven�t heard the last of us!�
          Foley says that this suggests that the �anti-commandeering� principle
          is not the end of the road. Foley thinks they�re keen to get another
          fact pattern just like
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Garcia</i> so that they can
          explicitly overrule it. Then we won�t be quite as sure what the Tenth

<p><span>One
final thought about substantive due process: hopefully this will provide some
comfort. Foley has been studying this
for 20 years. He thought it was
fascinating, especially the abortion issue. He took several classes that related to substantive due process. He still doesn’t feel like he really
understands substantive due process! He
feels like he understands it better than in law school, and he’s published
articles on the subject. Maybe other
people can figure it out, but he’s at a point where he feels that it’s an
inherently insoluble problem. Some
students have observed that the Court’s methodology in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Glucksberg</i> seems inconsistent with its methodology in </span><st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Lawrence</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span>, for example. Can we tell which way the Court will go in
the future? Foley doesn’t think we can,
though </span><st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
 >Lawrence</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span> is the more recent
decision. They seem to choose their
approach based on whether they want to grant or deny a right. Basically, don’t worry if you’re anxious
about substantive due process. Nobody
really understands it. The constitutional
meaning of liberty will take on many different viewpoints. Lawyers will have debates about how to
understand the constitutional protection of liberty without any further
specificity in the Fourteenth Amendment.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The state action doctrine</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>These
issues apply to the substantive due process concept and the procedural due
process concept. We may get a state action
question in practice. The state action
doctrine is that the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only</i> apply to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>state actors</i> (state governments and their subsidiaries, including
local governments). So these provisions
only apply to people like the governor, attorney general, or some other state
actor. You can’t sue the Ford Motor
Company, for example, for violating substantive due process. There are provisions of statutory law that
apply to the private sector, but in order to prevail on a Fourteenth Amendment
claim, you must be suing <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the government</i>. That’s also true of any provision of the Bill
of Rights as incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Look
at the example of campus speech codes: are “civility codes” an infringement on
the freedom of speech? There was a big
debate about this at Stanford. They talked
about free speech as an issue. But the First
Amendment freedom of speech as law does not apply to </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
 >Stanford</span></st1:PlaceName><span
> </span><st1:PlaceType><span
 >University</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span>, because it is a private university,
not a public university. On the other
hand, OSU is part of the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> state government, and we’re
bound by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Whether a campus civility code is applicable to a state university is a
real issue. On the other hand, it’s
merely a moral principle when applied to a private university. The state action doctrine is very crucial in
defining the scope of constitutional rights protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you ever get a state action doctrine question in practice, look it up in
Chemerinsky. The reason there may be questions
is that there are exceptions or “wrinkles” to this idea. Sometimes the conduct of a private entity is
still <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>attributable</i> to the government,
and thus that private entity is considered a state actor even though it’s
technically <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not the government</i>. It is useful to think of this as an exception
to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general rule</i> that you can’t
sue Microsoft, for example, under the Fourteenth Amendment. The two exceptions are clustered under two
categories: (1) the public function exception and (2) the
entanglement/entwinement exception.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
public function exception says that private entities, typically corporations,
act in a way that you would expect the government to do. Take as an example a “company town”. If a company owns a whole town, that company
is really acting like the government for that municipality. Since cities are considered arms of state governments,
we’ll say that this privately-owned city can be sued just like the state government
for violating the Fourteenth Amendment. That’s one kind of exception. There are pressure points put on this doctrine: consider, for example, </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
 >Easton</span></st1:PlaceName><span
> </span><st1:PlaceType><span
 >Town</span></st1:PlaceType><span
> </span><st1:PlaceType><span
 >Center</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span>. It’s a mall, but it’s not enclosed. It’s outdoors. Would the corporation that owns </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Easton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> be considers an arm of the government
because it controls the “streets” of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Easton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> and runs security
there? Foley believes that because it
isn’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really</i> a town it wouldn’t be
considered to be like a city government. The rule would apply: you can’t sue </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Easton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> for violating the Fourteenth
Amendment. If, on the other hand, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Easton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> developed such that it had
its own schools, homes, and so on, then it’s possible that it could be found to
be performing a public function. The
entanglement exception says that if the government contracts out one of its
functions to a private entity, that entity will be considered a state actor <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only in terms of the action it performs for
the government</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
precedents that exist cannot be reconciled into a coherent whole. The “liberal” position attributes state
action to more private entities. The
heyday was during the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Warren Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span>, which was very aggressive
in asserting civil rights and trying to eliminate discrimination. That Court was more inclined to find the
existence of state action if facts warranted it and say that a particular
private entity is doing what the government “used to do”. Consider the example of “white flight” to
private schools: are these schools really private, or are they taking over the
public school system? There were a
series of liberal precedents. On the
other hand, the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Rehnquist Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> has been much more
conservative. They have rolled back many
of the previous Court’s decisions. So if
you find a great case from the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
 >Warren Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> that seems to support your
client’s position, you must take it with a grain of salt, thinking about how
the modern Court would regard its earlier decision.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
most recent case involving the state action doctrine was </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Brentwood</span></i></st1:PlaceName><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
 normal'><span> </span></i><st1:PlaceType><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Academy</span></i></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span>, a 5-4 decision that was a “liberal victory”,
with O’Connor joining the “liberal wing” of the Court. The Tennessee Secondary School Athletic
Association accredited high school sports programs. There was litigation between the Academy and
the crediting agency. The argument was
that the Athletic Association was taking on a public function and acting in a
public capacity. The Court distinguishes
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>NCAA v. Tarkanian</i>, which was an
earlier </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Rehnquist Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> decision. The bottom line seems to be that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>most </i>of the schools regulated at the
high school level are public schools. So
anybody who is charged with accrediting and regulating high schools is
performing a public function, according to the Court. At the college level, however, there’s much
more of a split between public and private schools. Therefore, the NCAA is taken not to be
performing a state function.</span></p>

The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled
that the New York City Transit Authority's refusal to employ persons who use
methadone violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and,
in a subsequent opinion ruled that the policy violates Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed
without reaching the statutory question. On certiorari, the Supreme Court, Mr.
Justice Stevens held that: (1) statistical evidence did not support district
court's conclusion that Authority's regulation prohibiting the use of
narcotics, or its interpretation of that regulation to encompass users of
methadone, violated Title VII of Civil Rights Act, and (2) Authority's blanket
exclusion from <a name="SDU_2"></a>employment of persons who regularly use
narcotic drugs, including methadone, did not violate equal protection clause of
Fourteenth Amendment for failing to include more precise special rules for
methadone users who have progressed satisfactorily with their treatment and
who, when examined individually, satisfy Authority's employment criteria for <span
class=SpellE>nonsensitive</span> jobs.<br>

Petitioner, New York City Transit Authority (TA), which, in operating the
subway system and certain bus lines in </span></span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='mso-bookmark:StarPage'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>New York City</span></span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='mso-bookmark:StarPage'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>, employs about
47,000 persons, of whom many are employed in positions that involve danger to
themselves or to the public, enforces a general policy against employing
persons who use narcotic drugs. TA interprets its drug regulation to encompass
current users of methadone, including <span class=GramE>those receiving
methadone maintenance treatment</span> for curing heroin addiction.
Respondents, two former employees of TA **1357<a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_440_U.S._568,__99_S.Ct."> </a>who were dismissed while
they were receiving methadone treatment, and two persons who were refused
employment because they were receiving methadone treatment, brought a class
action, alleging, <i>inter <span class=SpellE>alia</span></i>, that TA's
blanket exclusion of all former heroin addicts receiving methadone treatments
was illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court found that
TA's blanket methadone policy violates the Equal Protection Clause, and granted
injunctive relief which, however, authorized TA to exclude methadone users from
specific categories of safety-sensitive positions and also to condition
eligibility on satisfactory performance in a methadone program for at least a
year. Subsequently, the District Court also held that TA's drug policy violates
Title VII because even though the policy was not adopted with a discriminatory
purpose, it nevertheless was not related to any of TA's business <a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_440_U.S._568,_*568,__99"></a><a name="SDU_12"></a>needs.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's constitutional holding
without reaching the statutory question. <i>Held<span class=GramE>:</span></i><br>
1. An amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 after certiorari was granted,
even if construed to proscribe TA's enforcement of a general rule denying
employment to methadone users, does not render the case moot, since
respondents' claims arose even before that Act itself was passed, and they have
been awarded monetary relief. More importantly, however this Court might
construe that Act, the concerns that prompted the grant of certiorari--the
lower courts' departure from the procedure normally followed in addressing
statutory and constitutional questions in the same case, and the concern that
those courts *569 erroneously decided the merits of such questions--would still
merit this Court's attention. <span class=GramE>P. 1363.</span><br>
2. The statistical evidence on which respondents and the District Court relied
does not support the conclusion that TA's regulation prohibiting the use of
narcotics, or its interpretation of that regulation to encompass users of
methadone, violated Title VII. Pp. 1365-1366.<br>
(a) The statistic that 81% of the employees referred to TA's medical director
for suspected violations of its narcotics rule were either black or Hispanic
indicates nothing about the racial composition of the employees suspected of
using methadone, and respondents have only challenged the rule to the extent
that it is construed to apply to methadone users. Nor does the <a name="SDU_13"></a>record
provide any information about the number of black, Hispanic, or white persons
who were dismissed for using methadone. <span class=GramE>P. 1365.</span><br>
(b) The statistic that about 63% of the persons in New York City receiving
methadone maintenance in <i>public</i> programs are black or Hispanic does not
indicate how many of these persons ever worked or sought to work for TA; tells
nothing about the class of otherwise-qualified applicants and employees who
have participated in methadone maintenance programs for over a year, the only
class improperly excluded by TA's policy under the District Court's analysis;
and affords no data on the 14,000 methadone users in <i>private</i> programs,
leaving open the possibility that the percentage of blacks and Hispanics in the
class of methadone users is not significantly greater than the percentage of
those minorities in the general population of New York City. Pp. 1365-1366.<br>
(c) Even if respondents' statistical showing is considered to be sufficient to
establish a prima facie case of discrimination, it is rebutted by TA's
demonstration that its narcotics rule (and the rule's application to methadone
users) is &quot;job related.&quot; The District Court's finding that the rule
was not motivated by racial animus forecloses any claim that it was merely a
pretext for intentional discrimination. Pp. 1366-1367.<br>
3. TA's blanket exclusion of persons who regularly use narcotic drugs,
including methadone, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause for failing <a
name="SDU_14"></a>to include more precise special rules for methadone users
**1358<a name="citeas((Cite_as:_440_U.S._568,_*569,__99"> </a>who have
progressed satisfactorily with their treatment for one year and who, when
examined individually, satisfy TA's employment criteria for <span class=SpellE>nonsensitive</span>
jobs. Pp. 1366-1370.<br>
(a) An employment policy such as TA's that postpones eligibility for employment
until the methadone treatment has been completed, rather than accepting an
intermediate point on an uncertain line--such as one year of treatment--is
rational and is neither unprincipled nor *570<a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_440_U.S._568,_*570,__99"> </a>invidious in the sense
that it implies disrespect for the excluded subclass. Pp. 1368-1369.<br>
(b) Even assuming that TA's rule is broader than necessary to exclude those
methadone users who are not actually qualified to work for TA, and that it is
probably unwise for a large employer like TA to rely on a general rule instead
of individualized considerations of every job applicant, nevertheless under the
circumstances of this case such assumptions concern matters of personnel policy
that do not implicate the principle safeguarded by the Equal Protection Clause.

&quot;former users&quot; issue was insufficient to support either the class or
relief determinations made with respect to those persons. We go further. As far
as we are aware there was <i>no</i> evidence offered at trial, and certainly
none relied upon by the District Court, that TA actually refused employment to
any former user entitled to relief under the injunction ordered by that court.
(As we point out in n. 12, <i>infra</i>, the one named plaintiff, Frasier, who
was a former user when the complaint was filed was clearly a <i>current</i>
user at the time he first applied for a job with TA and may well have been
properly perceived as a current user when he next applied, notwithstanding his
assertion of successful completion during the intervening three weeks. In any
case, he had not completed a full year of methadone maintenance and could therefore
be excluded under the District Court's injunction.) <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

statements of the parties on appeal and even off-hand and clearly erroneous
characterizations of the findings and evidence by the Court of Appeals, see
opinion of Mr. Justice Powell, <i>post</i>, at 1370, that determine the issues
properly before this Court. A policy excluding all former users would be harder
to justify than a policy applicable only to persons currently receiving
treatment. A court should not reach out to express an opinion on the constitutionality
of such a policy unless necessary to adjudicate a concrete dispute between
adverse litigants. We shall therefore confine our consideration to the legality
of TA's enforcement of its Rule 11(b) against <i>current</i> users of
methadone.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

The trial record contains extensive evidence concerning the success of
methadone maintenance programs, the employability of persons taking methadone,
and the ability of prospective employers to detect drug abuse or other
undesirable characteristics of methadone users. In general, the District Court
concluded that there are substantial numbers of methadone users who are just as
employable as other members of the general population and that normal
personnel-screening procedures--at least if augmented by some method of
obtaining information from the staffs of methadone programs--would enable TA to
identify the unqualified applicants on an individual basis. On the other hand,
the District Court recognized that at least one-third of the persons receiving
methadone treatment--and probably a good many more--would unquestionably be
classified as unemployable. </span><a name="FN;B01514"></a></span><a

assistance, for a period of several months or about a year. A person in this

class=GramE>After</span> extensively reviewing the evidence, the District Court
briefly stated its conclusion that TA's methadone policy is unconstitutional.
The conclusion rested on the legal proposition that a public entity
&quot;cannot bar persons from employment on the basis of criteria which have no
rational relation to the demands of the jobs to be performed.&quot; Because it
is clear that substantial numbers of methadone users are capable of performing
many of the jobs at TA, the court held that the Constitution will not tolerate
a blanket exclusion of all users from all jobs.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

The District Court enjoined TA from denying employment to any person solely
because of participation in a methadone maintenance program. Recognizing, <a
name="SDU_29"></a>however, the special responsibility for public safety borne
by certain TA employees and the correlation between longevity in a methadone
maintenance program and performance capability, the injunction authorized TA to
exclude methadone users from specific categories of safety-sensitive positions
and also to condition eligibility on satisfactory performance in a methadone
program for at least a year. In other words, the court held that TA could
lawfully adopt general rules excluding all methadone users from some jobs and a
large number of methadone users from all jobs.<br>

style='mso-bookmark:StarPage'><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>. This
determination was premised on the court's additional holding that TA's drug
policy violated Title VII. Having already concluded that the blanket *579<a
name="citeas((Cite_as:_440_U.S._568,_*579,__99"> </a>exclusion was not rationally
related to any business needs of TA, the court reasoned that the statute is
violated if the exclusionary policy has a discriminatory effect against blacks
and Hispanics. That effect was proved, in the District Court's view, by two
statistics: (1) of the employees referred to TA's medical consultant for
suspected violation of its drug policy, 81% are black or Hispanic; (2) between
62% and 65% of all methadone-maintained persons in New York City are black or
Hispanic. The court, however, did not find that TA's policy was motivated by
any bias against blacks or Hispanics; indeed, it expressly found that the
policy <a name="SDU_30"></a>was not adopted with a discriminatory purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

In this case, TA's Rule 11(b) places a meaningful restriction on all of its
employees and job applicants; in that sense the rule is one of general
applicability and satisfies the equal protection principle without further
inquiry. The District Court, however, interpreted the rule as applicable to the
limited class of persons who regularly use narcotic drugs, including methadone.
As so interpreted, we are necessarily confronted with the question whether the
rule reflects an impermissible bias against a special class.<br

like most other employees and applicants rather than like other users of
narcotics. But the District Court's findings unequivocally establish that there

for special rules for methadone users. Indeed, they vigorously defend the

The constitutional defect in TA's employment policies, according to the
District Court, is not that TA has special rules for methadone users, but <a

exempted from <i>some</i> requirements of the special rules. Left intact by its
holding are rules requiring special supervision of methadone users to detect
evidence of drug abuse, and excluding them from high-risk employment. Accepting
those rules, the District Court nonetheless concluded that employment in <span
class=SpellE>nonsensitive</span> jobs could not be denied to methadone users
who had progressed satisfactorily with their treatment for one year, and who,
when examined individually,**1368<a

the District Court erred in finding as facts that Frasier was using no
narcotics in April 1973 and that petitioners refused to hire him solely because
of his prior, apparently successful methadone treatment. As I read the facts as
recited by the Court, the District Court was clearly correct, but in any event
petitioners have not preserved this argument in the Court of Appeals or here.
See Defendants' Proposed Findings of Fact 6-7 (filed Oct. 18, 1974) (Frasier

grant of relief to respondent Frasier, makes it clear that the court intended

the reasons for the . . . drug policy is the fact that [petitioners] fee[l] an
adverse public reaction would result if it were generally known that
[petitioners] employed persons with a prior history of drug abuse, including
persons participating in methadone maintenance programs.&quot; It is hard for
me to reconcile that stipulation of animus against former addicts with our past
holdings that &quot;a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group
cannot constitute a <i>legitimate</i> governmental interest.&quot; On the other

is a legitimate basis of distinction in some circumstances; heroin addiction is
a serious affliction that will often affect employability. But sometimes
antipathy extends beyond the facts that may have given rise to it, and when

The District Court found, and petitioners have not challenged, that current
problem drinkers present more of an employment risk than do respondents.
Petitioners do not automatically discharge employees who are found to have a
drinking problem. <a

The Court argues that &quot;the fact that [petitioners have] the resources to
expend on one class of problem employees does not by itself establish a
constitutional duty on [their] part to come up with resources to spend on all classes
of problem employees.&quot; <span class=GramE><i>Ante</i>, at 1369, n. 37.</span>
If respondents were demanding to have the benefit of a rehabilitation program
extended to them, petitioners could perhaps argue for freedom to deal with only
one problem at a time due to limited resources. See <a

the lack of resources, or the desire to experiment in a limited field, might be
a legitimate objective explaining the classification. But respondents are not

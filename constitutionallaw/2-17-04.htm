        <span>Let�s compare two colleges in the state of </span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Could the state of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Let�s say that every student who attends </span

          ><span> </span

          ><st1:PlaceType><span>University</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place

          students? Is there a Commerce Clause problem here?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>What if </span

      <p>
        <span
          >Does the Dormant Commerce Clause say you can�t discriminate against
          out-of-state kids with respect to scholarships? More generally, when

          that aren�t available to citizens from other states?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Is it a form of discrimination to offer scholarships to </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> students but not to, for example, </span

          ><st1:place><span>Nevada</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          students? Sure, but it wouldn�t run into a constitutional problem. But
          why not?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Foley says that the Court doesn�t use the same Dormant Commerce
          Clause analysis when it analyzes a scholarship program compared to a
          tax exemption program. Even though both programs are discriminatory,
          handing out money will be treated differently than administering a tax
          exemption.</span

        <span
          >Discrimination in the granting of subsidies has different rules
          because it�s just handing out cash. But from economics, we discover
          that this has exactly the same economic effect as handing out a tax

        <span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The way the Court would think of the in-state/out-of-state tuition
          differential is that it would say that the lower tuition given to
          in-state students is a subsidy or something akin to a scholarship.
          Formalism seems to be triumphant!</span

        <span
          >Rule #1 about the Dormant Commerce Clause: The Supreme Court has
          probably decided 200-300 Dormant Commerce Clause cases in the 20<sup

          do we do? If you�re a lawyer, find the precedents that support your

          facially neutral. But in this case, we actually have facial
          discrimination in taxation. Therefore, we don�t have to put it in a

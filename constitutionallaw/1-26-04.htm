        <span
          >�If you thought the Commerce Clause was confusing and difficult, I
          hate to tell you about the Tenth Amendment.� Con Law is fuzzy! It
          seems like there are ranges of fuzziness, especially when it comes to
          the Tenth Amendment. Start with the expectation that it�s going to be
          unsettled and indeterminate.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In this case, the Court started off its analysis with Commerce
          Clause, finding that there was no Commerce Clause problem. Why was
          this law a valid exercise of the Commerce Clause power? What federal
          law is being challenged? It�s the DPPA. What does the law do? It
          restricts the state�s ability to sell personal information about
          drivers to businesses and other individuals. The DMVs of each state
          collect personal information from all drivers. They used to turn
          around and sell that information to telemarketers and other unsavory
          people.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But how is this connected to interstate commerce? For example, </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Ohio</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span>
          might sell its driver license information to a telemarketer in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Wyoming</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>. Or they could sell their list to a company in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          that also does business in another state. So the driver license
          information, though it starts out locally, it becomes a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">thing</i> in interstate
          commerce once it gets sold, and thus it is subject to regulation by
          Congress.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We spent a lot of time on the �substantial effects� test and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Wickard</i> and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="unitedstatesvlopez.htm">Lopez</a></i

          and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="unitedstatesvmorrison.htm">Morrison</a></i
          >. Why didn�t they go through an elaborate test like the ones we saw
          earlier? The Court�s impression is that this isn�t
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">intrastate</i> stuff. The
          information is a good that can and does travel between states. So
          there�s no need to get to the �substantial effects� inquiry.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In the Commerce Clause cases, the Court talked about three different
          things Congress can regulate: �channels� and �instrumentalities� of
          interstate commerce and things that are intrastate but have a
          �substantial effect� on interstate commerce. So how does the
          information being sold in this case fit into that rubric? The Court
          thinks of this as a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">direct</i> regulation on
          interstate commerce.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Did this statute have a Commerce Clause hook? Not exactly. It also
          seems like the federal government doesn�t discriminate between
          information that never leaves the state and the information that goes
          into interstate commerce.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Recall the �Child Labor Case�. The law in question was challenged on
          the basis of the Tenth Amendment, and the Supreme Court invalidated
          the law at the time. Later, this decision was overruled. Now we
          believe that Congress can regulate goods that crossed state lines,
          even if the reason they are being regulated is purely
          intrastate.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Foley thinks that the Court didn�t intend to make a big deal about
          the Commerce Clause in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="renovcondon.htm">Condon</a></i
          >, but it gives us a clue about what the Court will uphold on Commerce
          Clause grounds. So don�t miss the Commerce Clause significance of this
          case! Don�t take received wisdom! (Emanuel put
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"

        <span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">creative</i> lawyer is to think
          of a new angle that�s not in the treatise or hornbook. You use the
          treatise to get your bearings, but then you go further and come up
          with your own idea based on different cases than others have thought
          about.</span

          was poorly represented.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>Charlie Condon himself went to
          defend the state in the Supreme Court. State Attorney Generals have
          big egos! Sometimes they make mistakes. They want all the glory! But

          power, and we think it�s of the kind that Congress should address! We
          think they should do so because it�s truly an interstate problem,
          unlike guns and rape.� The Court sends a message from all nine
          justices: This is a power we�ll give to Congress. But why did Justice
          Thomas agree? Hmmm�maybe it had something to do with the fact that
          privacy rights are at stake.</span

          Amendment once the Court has said that the statute is within the
          Commerce Clause power? Why doesn�t that end the question? Why could
          something be a problem under the Tenth Amendment? How could it be a
          problem under the Tenth Amendment if there�s no Commerce Clause
          problem? What�s the reasoning process?</span

      <p>
        <span
          >One thing that helped this law be constitutional was the fact that it
          applied both to states and private individuals (though in actuality,
          these bits were in different parts of the statute). If the law was
          directly <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">exclusively</i> at
          state governments, it might be more likely to violate the Tenth

<p><b><span>The terrorism hypothetical
and more on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="printzvunitedstates.htm"><span class=SpellE>Printz</span></a></i></span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Foley
has been talking about the hypothetical of a large-scale terrorist attack. Say Congress, in an effort to put in to place
some advance planning in the event of a terrorist attack, says that there will
be a combined rapid-response team consisting largely of local law enforcement
officers who will be under the direction of the Department of Homeland
Security. In order to implement a decent
rapid response team, we need to rely on local </span><st1:place><span
>EMS</span></st1:place><span> and police.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
let’s say Congress passes a law saying that in the time of an emergency, </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
 >Tom</span></st1:PlaceName><span
> </span><st1:PlaceName><span
 >Ridge</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span> or whoever can require
local officers to do certain things. Is
that permissible under the Tenth Amendment as interpreted in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a href="printzvunitedstates.htm"><span
class=SpellE>Printz</span></a></i>? Say
it’s a real big emergency. We would need
a rapid response at the direction of the federal government. We don’t have federal personnel on the ground
at all times, and we don’t want them, either. We don’t want a federal standing army on </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> soil. We send American troops abroad as necessary,
but the idea of a standing </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> army on </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> soil is somewhat anathema
to us. We rely on state and local governments
to keep the peace. Part of the idea of
the federal system of government is keeping some power out of the hands of the
central government and leaving it in the hands of local governments to promote
freedom.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Would
it be consistent with the goal of promoting freedom if the only way to protect
against terrorism would be to have a federal force that replicates local government
functions? Is that what this decision
says? The Court says that we are not
using a balancing test in this area of constitutional law. We are creating a categorical prohibition of
enlisting state officers to perform federal functions. There is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no
exception </i>to the principle for emergencies! Do we still take the Court at its word, given that the opinion was
written before 9/11?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Most
of constitutional law has balancing aspects. Even free speech rights are balanced against compelling governmental
interests.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
seems <span class=GramE>unlikely,</span> however, that a state would object to
participating in a new program the federal government would adopt to deal with
terrorism. The states pretty much all
agree. On the other hand, there may not
be complete agreement as to the details. For example, not everyone is so hot on all part of the PATRIOT Act. What if a particular state wants to go
against a particular detail of Congress’s implementation of the plan?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Congress
might try to induce the states through the Spending Clause. Congress can’t mandate the kind of background
checks in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="printzvunitedstates.htm"><span class=SpellE>Printz</span></a></i>, but
maybe they can dangle some money in front of the states to induce them to stick
to the program.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if Congress says the only way we can trace terrorist suspects would be if local
law enforcement officers submit monthly reports to the Department of Homeland
Security? Would it be different if local
police departments were forced to gather information? The only difference between this and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a href="printzvunitedstates.htm"><span
class=SpellE>Printz</span></a></i> is the “emergency” aspect.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
do we believe the Court when they say that there is no emergency exception to
the rule? Would the Court cut the federal
government <span class=GramE>more slack</span> today after 9/11 than they did
in 1997? Foley suggests we need to do a
reality check. But don’t always trust
Foley as a predictor of Supreme Court outcomes!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about Congress’s war powers? Could Congress
declare martial law? If they did, would
the Tenth Amendment get suspended?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>key dispute</i> between the
majority and the dissent in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="printzvunitedstates.htm"><span class=SpellE>Printz</span></a></i>: We’ll
always need cooperation and coordination between federal, state, and local governments. If there is some dispute about how best to do
this, who gets the final say? Is it Congress
as the elected representatives of the American people (subject to the presidential
veto)? Or is it the Supreme Court acting
on behalf of state and local governments?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
states are well-represented before Congress. It’s not like the Congress turns a deaf ear to the concerns of the
states <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>qua</i> states. The dissent says that there are ways to make accommodations
politically. If Congress passes a law
that intrudes on the sovereignty of a state, presumably it has done so for what
it believes is a good reason. So shall
the Supreme Court allow Congress to make that judgment, or will the Supreme
Court instead say that the ultimate authority lies with the governors of the
states?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Are
the members of the Supreme Court going to render a decision that would destroy
the country? Say the government had a
credible argument that under the Constitution, as written, we can’t adequately
handle terrorist threats. Would the Supreme
Court say that the Constitution doesn’t allow us to defend ourselves? Would the answer be different if the stakes
are higher?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Constitution doesn’t have a provision that allows the President or Congress to
suspend the Constitution. We <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i> operate under the Constitution
and the rule of law. In other countries,
people can suspend the operation of the Constitution for a while when they say
there is an emergency.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
exercising its authority, the Court will always have a dose of realism when it
interprets the Constitution. We live
under the Constitution, the Court will interpret the Constitution, but Foley
says it will do so with a dose of realism.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
year, the Court has already granted cert in some terrorism cases. These cases don’t raise federalism issues.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Supreme Court doesn’t have any power to enforce its own judgments. It relies on the executive branch to carry
them out. The Court is quite sensitive
to this point. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="printzvunitedstates.htm"><span class=SpellE>Printz</span></a></i>
isn’t a national security case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Foley
says that because we’re in flux, the best principle might be this: “Congress
may not regulate state governments in ways that are inconsistent with a state’s
status or dignity as a sovereign government, including regulations that force
states to undertake specific actions concerning their own citizens that a state
does not wish to undertake.” Congress
can’t be the big bully and push the states around. This “animating idea” is bigger, according to
Foley, than any of the detailed rules the Court has set out to this point. The reason why <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="renovcondon.htm">Condon</a></i> was unanimous was that the
Court didn’t see an affront to the dignity of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >South Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> that they couldn’t sell
driver’s license information. In <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a href="printzvunitedstates.htm"><span
class=SpellE>Printz</span></a></i>, we’re talking about what police chiefs are
going to do in their jobs. Police power
is the most basic sovereign power. Forcing local cops around seems to the Court like an affront to the
dignity of the states as sovereigns. The
Court says that we’re not doing balancing, but they might try to “smuggle in”
some balancing notions. There may be
some “hidden” balancing even if there isn’t any up-front balancing.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Apply
this to the terrorism example: The sovereignty of each state may be dependent
upon the existence of the union. If the federal
government is ordering states around to protect the union, that may not be as
bad as ordering them around for some domestic policy interests.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
object of the Fourteenth Amendment was to constrain state power in certain
ways. States can’t suddenly assert the Tenth
Amendment as an objection to an equal protection claim. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The states have no right to take away equal
protection.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:State><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
 >New York</span></i></st1:place></st1:State><span> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="printzvunitedstates.htm"><span class=SpellE>Printz</span></a></i>
are not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>compelled</i> by the text of the Tenth
Amendment. The majorities in these cases
are really being motivated by an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>idea</i>
about federalism and the two-level structure of our government. That idea is always going to be on the minds
of the justices that care about the idea. In any constitutional case, you must be sensitive to this idea. Federalism is always on (some of) the
justices’ minds! On the other hand, some
of the justices, like Breyer and Stevens, don’t like federalism!</span></p>

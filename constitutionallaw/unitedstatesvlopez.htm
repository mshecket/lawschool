<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Facts:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> Congress passed a statute (the “Gun-Free School Zones
Act of 1990”) providing for federal criminal sanctions against people who went
into a “school zone” with a gun.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
defendant was caught with a gun on school premises and was charged under the
federal law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The defendant challenged
the statute as unconstitutional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
particular, he argued that banning guns from schools wasn’t one of the powers
enumerated to the federal legislature in Article I of the Constitution.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district court didn’t buy the argument,
saying that the power of the statute was allowed under the Commerce Clause. The
defendant ultimately was convicted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
appealed his conviction to the Fifth Circuit, which overturned the conviction,
saying that the statute went beyond the bounds of the Commerce Clause.<span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Issue:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> Is the Act constitutional?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, is Congress given the power
by the Constitution to regulate guns in schools under the Commerce Clause?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Rule:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> The Constitution has been interpreted by the Supreme
Court such that Congress has three broad areas of power under the Commerce
Clause: (1) to “regulate the use of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>channels</i>
of interstate commerce”, (2) “to regulate and protect the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>instrumentalities</i>” or “persons or things” in interstate commerce
even if they only relate to “intrastate activities”, and (3) to regulate
activities “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>having a substantial relation</i>
to interstate commerce”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Analysis:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> The majority finds that if the Gun-Free School Zone
statute has a constitutional basis, it must be in the third area of power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the question is whether the statute
regulates activities that are related to interstate commerce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court sets down new precedent in
declaring that such activities must “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>substantially
affect</i>” interstate commerce and not just “affect” it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Court finds that the
statute has nothing to do with commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There is also no requirement in the statute that the offense punished
has some relationship to commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even
if there was that requirement, it would have to be proven in each case beyond a
reasonable doubt that there was sufficient connection between the offense and
the regulation of interstate commerce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Court rejects the
government’s argument that firearms in schools are actually substantially
related to interstate commerce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Court reasons that if guns in schools are related, then pretty much anything
can be related, including stuff like marriage, divorce, child custody, and
“direct regulation of education”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Court figures that the Framers couldn’t have possibly meant for the Commerce
Clause power to be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>this </i>broad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Conclusion:</span></b><span

and finds the statute unconstitutional.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A federal grand jury indicted
respondent on one count of knowing possession of a firearm at a school zone, in
violation of §922(q). Respondent moved to dismiss his federal indictment on the
ground that §922(q) &quot;is unconstitutional as it is beyond the power of
Congress to legislate control over our public schools.&quot; The District Court
denied the motion, concluding that §922(q) &quot;is a constitutional exercise
of Congress' well defined power to regulate activities in and affecting
commerce, and the `business' of elementary, middle and high schools . . . affects
interstate commerce.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a. Respondent waived his
right to a jury trial. The District Court conducted a bench trial, found him
guilty of violating §922(q), and sentenced him to six months' imprisonment and

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>On appeal, respondent
challenged his conviction based on his claim that §922(q) exceeded Congress'

Fifth Circuit agreed and reversed respondent's conviction. It held that, in
light of what it characterized as insufficient congressional findings and
legislative history, &quot;section 922(q), in the full reach of its terms, is
invalid as beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause.&quot; 2 F.

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Commerce, undoubtedly,
is traffic, but it is something more: it is intercourse. It describes the

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The commerce power &quot;is
the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;It is not intended to
say that these words comprehend that commerce, which is completely internal,
which is carried on between man and man in a State, or between different parts
of the same State, and which does not extend to or affect other States. Such a
power would be inconvenient, and is certainly unnecessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;Comprehensive as the
word `among' is, it may very properly be restricted to that commerce which
concerns more States than one. . . . The enumeration presupposes something not
enumerated; and that something, if we regard the language or the subject of the

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>For nearly a century
thereafter, the Court's Commerce Clause decisions dealt but rarely with the
extent of Congress' power, and almost entirely with the Commerce Clause as a
limit on state legislation that discriminated against interstate commerce. See,
e.g., Veazie v. Moor, 14 How. 568, 573-575 (1853) (upholding a state created
steamboat monopoly because it involved regulation of wholly internal commerce);
Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U.S. 1, 17, 20-22 (1888) (upholding a state prohibition on
the manufacture of intoxicating liquor because the commerce power &quot;does
not comprehend the purely domestic commerce of a State which is carried on
between man and man within a State or between different parts of the same
State&quot;); see also L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 306 (2d ed. 1988).
Under this line of precedent, the Court held that certain categories of
activity such as &quot;production,&quot; &quot;manufacturing,&quot; and
&quot;mining&quot; were within the province of state governments, and thus were
beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause. See Wickard v. Filburn,
317 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> 111, 121 (1942) (describing development of Commerce
Clause jurisprudence).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In 1887, Congress enacted the
Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379, and in 1890, Congress enacted the
Sherman Antitrust Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. These
laws ushered in a new era of federal regulation under the commerce power. When
cases involving these laws first reached this Court, we imported from our
negative Commerce Clause cases the approach that Congress could not regulate
activities such as &quot;production,&quot; &quot;manufacturing,&quot; and
&quot;mining.&quot; See, e.g., </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:14.0pt'> 238, 304 (1936) (&quot;Mining brings the subject
matter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of it&quot;).
Simultaneously, however, the Court held that, where the interstate and
intrastate aspects of commerce were so mingled together that full regulation of
interstate commerce required incidental regulation of intrastate commerce, the
Commerce Clause authorized such regulation. See, e.g., Houston, E. &amp; W. T.
R. Co. v. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>United

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In A. L. A. Schecter Poultry
Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 550 (1935), the Court struck down
regulations that fixed the hours and wages of individuals employed by an
intrastate business because the activity being regulated related to interstate
commerce only indirectly. In doing so, the Court characterized the distinction
between direct and indirect effects of intrastate transactions upon interstate
commerce as &quot;a fundamental one, essential to the maintenance of our
constitutional system.&quot; </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel,
Darby, and Wickard ushered in an era of Commerce Clause jurisprudence that
greatly expanded the previously defined authority of Congress under that
Clause. In part, this was a recognition of the great changes that had occurred
in the way business was carried on in this country. Enterprises that had once
been local or at most regional in nature had become national in scope. But the
doctrinal change also reflected a view that earlier Commerce Clause cases
artificially had constrained the authority of Congress to regulate interstate
commerce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>But even these modern era
precedents which have expanded congressional power under the Commerce Clause
confirm that this power is subject to outer limits. In Jones &amp; Laughlin
Steel, the Court warned that the scope of the interstate commerce power
&quot;must be considered in the light of our dual system of government and may
not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect
and remote that to embrace them, in view of our complex society, would
effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is
local and create a completely centralized government.&quot; 301 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

may regulate intrastate activity that has a &quot;substantial effect&quot; on
interstate commerce); Wickard, supra, at 125 (Congress may regulate activity
that &quot;exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce&quot;).
Since that time, the Court has heeded that warning and undertaken to decide
whether a rational basis existed for concluding that a regulated activity
sufficiently affected interstate commerce. See, e.g., Hodel v. Virginia Surface

dissent's warnings that the Court was powerless to enforce the limitations on
Congress' commerce powers because &quot;[a]ll activities affecting commerce,
even in the minutest degree, [Wickard], may be regulated and controlled by Congress,&quot;
392 U. S., at 204 (Douglas, J., dissenting), the Wirtz Court replied that the
dissent had misread precedent as &quot;[n]either here nor in Wickard has the
Court declared that Congress may use a relatively trivial impact on commerce as
an excuse for broad general regulation of state or private activities,&quot;
id., at 197, n. 27. Rather, &quot;[t]he Court has said only that where a
general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de

consequence.&quot; Ibid. (first emphasis added).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Consistent with this
structure, we have identified three broad categories of activity that Congress
may regulate under its commerce power. Perez v. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:14.0pt'>, supra, at 150; see also Hodel v. Virginia Surface
Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., supra, at 276-277. First, Congress may regulate
the use of the channels of interstate commerce. See, e.g., Darby, 312 U. S., at
114; Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at 256 (&quot; `[T]he authority of Congress
to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious
uses has been frequently sustained, and is no longer open to question.' &quot;

regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons
or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from
intrastate activities. See, e.g., Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U.S. 342 (1914);

supra, at 150 (&quot;[F]or example, the destruction of an aircraft (18 U.S.C. §
32), or . . . thefts from interstate shipments (18 U.S.C. § 659)&quot;).
Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those
activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, Jones &amp;
Laughlin Steel, 301 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

affect interstate commerce. Wirtz, supra, at 196, n. 27.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Within this final category,
admittedly, our case law has not been clear whether an activity must
&quot;affect&quot; or &quot;substantially affect&quot; interstate commerce in
order to be within Congress' power to regulate it under the Commerce Clause.
Compare Preseault v. ICC, 494 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:14.0pt'> 1, 17 (1990), with Wirtz, supra, at 196, n. 27 (the
Court has never declared that &quot;Congress may use a relatively trivial
impact on commerce as an excuse for broad general regulation of state or
private activities&quot;). We conclude, consistent with the great weight of our
case law, that the proper test requires an analysis of whether the regulated
activity &quot;substantially affects&quot; interstate commerce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We now turn to consider the
power of Congress, in the light of this framework, to enact §922(q). The first
two categories of authority may be quickly disposed of: §922(q) is not a
regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce, nor is it an
attempt to prohibit the interstate transportation of a commodity through the
channels of commerce; nor can §922(q) be justified as a regulation by which
Congress has sought to protect an instrumentality of interstate commerce or a
thing in interstate commerce. Thus, if §922(q) is to be sustained, it must be
under the third category as a regulation of an activity that substantially
affects interstate commerce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>First, we have upheld a wide
variety of congressional Acts regulating intrastate economic activity where we
have concluded that the activity substantially affected interstate commerce.
Examples include the regulation of intrastate coal mining; Hodel, supra,
intrastate extortionate credit transactions, Perez, supra, restaurants
utilizing substantial interstate supplies, McClung, supra, inns and hotels
catering to interstate guests, Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, and production
and consumption of home grown wheat, Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942).
These examples are by no means exhaustive, but the pattern is clear. Where
economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation
regulating that activity will be sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Even Wickard, which is
perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over
intrastate activity, involved economic activity in a way that the possession of
a gun in a school zone does not. Roscoe Filburn operated a small farm in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, on which, in the year involved, he raised 23 acres
of wheat. It was his practice to sow winter wheat in the fall, and after
harvesting it in July to sell a portion of the crop, to feed part of it to
poultry and livestock on the farm, to use some in making flour for home
consumption, and to keep the remainder for seeding future crops. The Secretary
of Agriculture assessed a penalty against him under the Agricultural Adjustment
Act of 1938 because he harvested about 12 acres more wheat than his allotment
under the Act permitted. The Act was designed to regulate the volume of wheat
moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and
shortages, and concomitant fluctuation in wheat prices, which had previously
obtained. The Court said, in an opinion sustaining the application of the Act
to Filburn's activity:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&quot;One of the primary
purposes of the Act in question was to increase the market price of wheat and
to that end to limit the volume thereof that could affect the market. It can
hardly be denied that a factor of such volume and variability as home consumed
wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions. This
may arise because being in marketable condition such wheat overhangs the market
and, if induced by rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price
increases. But if we assume that it is never marketed, it supplies a need of
the man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open
market. Home grown wheat in this sense competes with wheat in commerce.&quot;

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Section 922(q) is a criminal
statute that by its terms has nothing to do with &quot;commerce&quot; or any
sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.
[n.3] Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of
economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the
intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained under
our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are
connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate,
substantially affects interstate commerce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Second, §922(q) contains no
jurisdictional element which would ensure, through case by case inquiry, that
the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce. For example, in
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>United
  States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>
v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336 (1971), the Court interpreted former 18 U.S.C. § 1202(a),
which made it a crime for a felon to &quot;receiv[e], posses[s], or transpor[t]
in commerce or affecting commerce . . . any firearm.&quot; 404 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, at 337. The Court interpreted the possession
component of §1202(a) to require an additional nexus to interstate commerce
both because the statute was ambiguous and because &quot;unless Congress
conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly
changed the federal state balance.&quot; </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Id.</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, at 349. The </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Bass Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> set aside the conviction because although the
Government had demonstrated that Bass had possessed a firearm, it had failed
&quot;to show the requisite nexus with interstate commerce.&quot; </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Id.</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, at 347. The Court thus interpreted the statute to
reserve the constitutional question whether Congress could regulate, without
more, the &quot;mere possession&quot; of firearms. See id., at 339, n. 4; see
also United States v. Five Gambling Devices, 346 U.S. 441, 448 (1953)
(plurality opinion) (&quot;The principle is old and deeply imbedded in our
jurisprudence that this Court will construe a statute in a manner that requires
decision of serious constitutional questions only if the statutory language
leaves no reasonable alternative&quot;). Unlike the statute in Bass, §922(q)
has no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete
set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with
or effect on interstate commerce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Although as part of our
independent evaluation of constitutionality under the Commerce Clause we of
course consider legislative findings, and indeed even congressional committee
findings, regarding effect on interstate commerce, see, e.g., Preseault v. ICC,
494 U.S. 1, 17 (1990), the Government concedes that &quot;[n]either the statute
nor its legislative history contain[s] express congressional findings regarding
the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school zone.&quot;

5-6. We agree with the Government that Congress normally is not required to
make formal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activity has on
interstate commerce. See McClung, 379 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:14.0pt'>, at 156 (&quot;Congress need [not] make
particularized findings in order to legislate&quot;). But to the extent that
congressional findings would enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment
that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce, even
though no such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye, they are
lacking here. [n.4]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Government argues that
Congress has accumulated institutional expertise regarding the regulation of
firearms through previous enactments. Cf. Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> 448, 503 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring). We agree,
however, with the Fifth Circuit that importation of previous findings to
justify §922(q) is especially inappropriate here because the &quot;prior
federal enactments or Congressional findings [do not] speak to the subject
matter of section 922(q) or its relationship to interstate commerce. Indeed,
section 922(q) plows thoroughly new ground and represents a sharp break with the
long standing pattern of federal firearms legislation.&quot; 2 F. 3d, at 1366.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Government's essential
contention, in fine, is that we may determine here that §922(q) is valid
because possession of a firearm in a local school zone does indeed
substantially affect interstate commerce. Brief for </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> 17. The Government argues that possession of a
firearm in a school zone may result in violent crime and that violent crime can
be expected to affect the functioning of the national economy in two ways.
First, the costs of violent crime are substantial, and, through the mechanism
of insurance, those costs are spread throughout the population. See </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> v. Evans, 928 F. 2d 858, 862 (CA9 1991). Second,
violent crime reduces the willingness of individuals to travel to areas within
the country that are perceived to be unsafe. Cf. Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>U. S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, at 253. The Government also argues that the presence
of guns in schools poses a substantial threat to the educational process by
threatening the learning environment. A handicapped educational process, in
turn, will result in a less productive citizenry. That, in turn, would have an
adverse effect on the Nation's economic well being. As a result, the Government
argues that Congress could rationally have concluded that §922(q) substantially
affects interstate commerce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We pause to consider the
implications of the Government's arguments. The Government admits, under its
&quot;costs of crime&quot; reasoning, that Congress could regulate not only all
violent crime, but all activities that might lead to violent crime, regardless
of how tenuously they relate to interstate commerce. See Tr. of Oral </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Arg.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> 8-9. Similarly, under the Government's &quot;national
productivity&quot; reasoning, Congress could regulate any activity that it
found was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens: family
law (including marriage, divorce, and child custody), for example. Under the
theories that the Government presents in support of §922(q), it is difficult to
perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law
enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign. Thus,
if we were to accept the Government's arguments, we are hard pressed to posit
any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Although Justice Breyer
argues that acceptance of the Government's rationales would not authorize a
general federal police power, he is unable to identify any activity that the
States may regulate but Congress may not. Justice Breyer posits that there might
be some limitations on Congress' commerce power such as family law or certain
aspects of education. Post, at 10-11. These suggested limitations, when viewed
in light of the dissent's expansive analysis, are devoid of substance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Justice Breyer focuses, for
the most part, on the threat that firearm possession in and near schools poses
to the educational process and the potential economic consequences flowing from
that threat. Post, at 5-9. Specifically, the dissent reasons that (1) gun
related violence is a serious problem; (2) that problem, in turn, has an
adverse effect on classroom learning; and (3) that adverse effect on classroom
learning, in turn, represents a substantial threat to trade and commerce. Post,
at 9. This analysis would be equally applicable, if not more so, to subjects
such as family law and direct regulation of education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>For instance, if Congress
can, pursuant to its Commerce Clause power, regulate activities that adversely
affect the learning environment, then, a fortiori, it also can regulate the
educational process directly. Congress could determine that a school's
curriculum has a-significant&quot; effect on the extent of classroom learning.
As a result, Congress could mandate a federal curriculum for local elementary
and secondary schools because what is taught in local schools has a significant
&quot;effect on classroom learning,&quot; cf. post, at 9, and that, in turn,
has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Justice Breyer rejects our
reading of precedent and argues that &quot;Congress . . . could rationally
conclude that schools fall on the commercial side of the line.&quot; Post, at
16. Again, Justice Breyer's rationale lacks any real limits because, depending
on the level of generality, any activity can be looked upon as commercial. Under
the dissent's rationale, Congress could just as easily look at child rearing as
&quot;fall[ing] on the commercial side of the line&quot; because it provides a
&quot;valuable service--namely, to equip [children] with the skills they need
to survive in life and, more specifically, in the workplace.&quot; Ibid. We do
not doubt that Congress has authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate
numerous commercial activities that substantially affect interstate commerce
and also affect the educational process. That authority, though broad, does not
include the authority to regulate each and every aspect of local schools.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Admittedly, a determination
whether an intrastate activity is commercial or noncommercial may in some cases
result in legal uncertainty. But, s o long as Congress' authority is limited to
those powers enumerated in the Constitution, and so long as those enumerated

formulations, and in the nature of things they cannot be. But we think they
point the way to a correct decision of this case. The possession of a gun in a
local school zone is in no sense an economic activity that might, through
repetition elsewhere, substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce.
Respondent was a local student at a local school; there is no indication that
he had recently moved in interstate commerce, and there is no requirement that
his possession of the firearm have any concrete tie to interstate commerce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>To uphold the Government's
contentions here, we would have to pile inference upon inference in a manner
that would bid fair to convert congressional authority under the Commerce
Clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the States.
Admittedly, some of our prior cases have taken long steps down that road,
giving great deference to congressional action. See supra, at 8. The broad
language in these opinions has suggested the possibility of additional
expansion, but we decline here to proceed any further. To do so would require
us to conclude that the Constitution's enumeration of powers does not
presuppose something not enumerated, cf. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, at 195, and
that there never will be a distinction between what is truly national and what
is truly local, cf. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel, supra, at 30. This we are

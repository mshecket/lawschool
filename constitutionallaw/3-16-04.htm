<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Constitutional Law Class
Notes </span><st1:date Year="2004" Day="16" Month="3"><span style='font-size:
 14.0pt'>3/16/04</span></st1:date><span style='font-size:14.0pt'></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Two things: What about gay
marriage? What’s the status under the Fourteenth
Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of laws like the Ohio DOMA? This is a HOT TOPIC! Does the text of the Equal Protection Clause
say anything about gay marriage? If the
text of the Constitution doesn’t resolve this question, where should a judge
look? Should the judge look at original
intent? What about the fact that statutes
against interracial marriage are now unconstitutional? Does that change the meaning or understanding
of the Equal Protection Clause? If the
Court can abandon original intent with respect to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>some </i>issues, then why can’t the Court abandon original intent with
respect to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other</i> issues, like gay
marriage?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Second: People who believe that
the Court should not be guided by narrowly understood original intent argue
that you shouldn’t look to what the authors of the Fourteenth Amendment thought
about any <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>specific </i>problem. Instead, you should look to the fact that the
drafters wanted to add a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general
principle</i> to the Constitution. If
there is a gap between contemporary understanding of that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>general</i> idea and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>original</i>
and specific understanding of the idea, the Court should adopt the general
principle. Recall that at the time of
the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the galleries in Congress were
segregated. It is clear that the authors
of the Fourteenth Amendment didn’t mean to render segregation unconstitutional. But maybe they misdrafted the amendment in
some sense and did more than they specifically intended to do.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If the Court has one
conception of the general idea but it is at odds with what a large segment of
the people believe, then what should the Court do? Should the Court follow its own understanding
of equality and equal protection, or should it be guided by the views of the
American people in general?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>More on the VMI case</span></b><span style='font-size:

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>How does the Court apply
intermediate scrutiny in this case? Why
is it that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> loses under intermediate scrutiny? Why is </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> incapable of justifying the existence of VMI under
this test?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> tries to argue that VMI is just one school of many,
and there are lots of other schools that aren’t single-sex. They want to say that it would support
diversity to have one school that isn’t coed. Why does the Court feel that this diversity interest doesn’t work to
argue for the existence of VMI? Why is
the existence of VMI an inappropriate means of advancing the interest of
diversity?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Why doesn’t VMI further
diversity? VMI is a male-only
institution. They don’t allow
women. Say you’re a woman and you want
to go to VMI. There’s no other place
that you could go! The Court says that
this is male preference, not diversity.</span></p>

<p><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> also set up a female counterpart to VMI at Mary
Baldwin, and the Court found that it wasn’t close enough.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The lesson of this case is
that the Court is extremely suspicious of any attempt to respond to a history
of segregation with a creation of an alternative rather than integration.</span></p>

Service</span></i></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This was a closely divided
decision, 5-4. Basically, this case
involved a rule that if you’re born overseas and your mother is an American
citizen, then the child gets American citizenship. But if the father is an American citizen, it’s
not automatic. This is facial gender
discrimination in the law. It’s argued
that paternity can be proved. But the majority
finds that the law isn’t meant to be exclusionary. To the majority, the law didn’t have the same
feel as the law in the VMI case. The Court
gives the federal government more leeway over immigration law than it gave the
state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span

style='font-size:14.0pt'> that thinks it would be better educational practice
to have a single-sex option for middle school girls especially in regard to
math class. What if this is challenged
by boys who want a boys-only math class?</span></p>

          law. The defendant moved to dismiss on this basis, citing
          <i><a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i> and subsequent
          cases, and the trial court granted the motion. The plaintiff appealed,
          saying that the FRCP rules in diversity actions. The Circuit Court
          ruled that the state statute should govern because it is substantive
          rather than merely procedural. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme
          Court.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The majority writes that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as
          adopted by the Supreme Court do not violate the Rules Enabling Act,
          nor are they unconstitutional.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court is trying to remedy a divergence between the
          <i><a href="removal.htm">Erie</a></i> line of cases and those
          construing the Rules Enabling Act.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court finds that if there was no conflict with state law, the
          Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would control, but
          <i><a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i> presents a
          problem. The defendant argued that the outcome-determinative test must
          be used, and under that test the defendant would win immediately.
          However, the Court says that the outcome-determinative test is not
          absolute.

          is meant to remedy problems arising from <i>big</i> differences
          between state and federal law, not <i>tiny, insubstantial </i>ones.
          The Court suggests that the difference between </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          law and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in this case is
          <i>not that big</i>. To figure out which law controls, the Court says
          that the policy reasons underlying
          <i><a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i> must be
          considered.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court says that the competing rules, though
          outcome-determinative, have little or no relevance to the choice of a
          forum. You wouldn�t decide to file in state versus federal court based
          solely on the choice between these two laws. The difference between
          the two laws also doesn�t raise any equal protection problems.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court further argues that
          <i><a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i> has never been
          used to <i>kill </i>a Federal Rule. The Federal Rules of Civil
          Procedure have not been held to be invalid, only not as broad as
          alleged and thus trumped <i>in a particular case</i

          anything that can reasonably be called �procedural� and put into the
          Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will be allowed to control, no matter
          how much it screws up rights granted by the states. Harlan finds that

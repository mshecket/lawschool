<p><b><span>The
two functions of the <i>Shoe</i> test</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Justice
West says that the main functions of the <i>Shoe</i> test are:</span></p>

states’ power in line</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>These
ideas come right out of <i><a href="pennoyervneff.html">Pennoyer</a></i>. Defendants ought not be subject to unfair
burdens, and state power must be constrained.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
first function is known as the “convenience” prong of <i>Shoe</i>. The second function is known as the “sovereignty”
prong.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The
“convenience” prong</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>White
says that the “fair play” test speaks to the convenience of a particular forum. He spells out in detail what he perceives to
be the factors one ought to consider on this prong. He says how we will do “fair play” and “substantive
justice” from now on.</span></p>

<br/>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span>On an exam, know and go
through all five prongs. However, the
big three are the first three, where the defendant’s burden is primary.</span></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We’ll
be seeing these all week.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Note
that these factors have nothing to do with minimum contacts, but rather with “traditional
notions of fair play &amp; substantial justice”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Does
the court apply these five factors in the case of Seaway and World-Wide? No, and what does that tell us? He takes a lot of time to develop these
factors, yet he doesn’t apply them. What
conclusion do we draw? He implies that “<i>minimum
contacts</i>”<i> is the threshold</i>, and thus if you don’t have contacts, you
never get to fair play.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
there are two prongs, and two <i>parts</i>. The parts are (1) minimum contacts, and (2) fair play, as detailed by
White.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Supreme Court reverses the ruling of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, and thus </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> has no jurisdiction over
the defendants.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Minimum
Contacts in <i>World-Wide</i></span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
this case is not decided on fair play, it must be decided on contacts. What do we look at for contacts?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is <span
class=SpellE>foreseeability</span> the test? NO! White explicitly rejects this
as the test. It’s conceivable that
everything every manufacturer makes could find its way to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about foreseeing being sued in a jurisdiction? You might decide to get insurance.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>Remember
to reread your brief before class, especially if it’s been a long time since
you looked at the case</span></i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>White
gives us other suggestions. How about “purposeful
<span class=SpellE>availment</span>”? Well, that gives the defendant clear notice that they can get sued in
the state where they solicit business. But Seaway and World-Wide don’t solicit business in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and in no way seek the
legal protection of that state.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about the “seeks to serve” standard? If
you market in other states, and try to get business there, it’s reasonable to
think it’s possible you can get sued there.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court never gives us a clear definition of “minimum contacts”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
purposeful <span class=SpellE>availment</span> and the “seeks to serve”
standards apply to minimum contacts, while the five convenience factors above
relate to fair play.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=SpellE><b><span>Hypotheticals</span></b></span><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
we have an Audi dealer in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Camden</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. The dealer advertises in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Could </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> have jurisdiction? <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>How much did they advertise and in what
venues? Did they broadcast, and if so,
where? Did they advertise on Pennsylvania
TV? The content of the advertisement
might be important as well. How many
cars did they sell in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Philadelphia</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> and how many in New </span><st1:place><span
 >Jersey</span></st1:place><span>?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Another
example: consider Seaway. Instead of
just buying the car, you go in to have your brakes done and then you end up in
a wreck in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> due to those faulty
brakes. Will </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> have jurisdiction in this
case? What distinguishes this case from <i>World-Wide</i>? What if Seaway has notice? What has changed about the contacts if Seaway
is put on notice? That’s not going to
make a difference. There must be more than
notice to create contacts.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Two
forgotten defendants: Audi and VW</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Initially,
Audi didn’t object to jurisdiction and VW conceded to jurisdiction after a
short fight. What does White tell us
about jurisdiction over these two parties?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>He
says if the defendants introduce their products into the “stream of commerce”
in a jurisdiction, they will be subject to the jurisdiction of that forum. Aren’t Seaway and World-Wide putting products
into the stream of commerce too? What’s
different?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We’ll
pick up here tomorrow. Stream of
commerce segues into <i>Asahi</i>, which we will begin tomorrow.</span></p>

at trial? We need to show damages, and
the doctors who can testify will be in <st1:State><st1:place>Oklahoma</st1:place></st1:State>,
as will the other driver in the accident. Why would it be more efficient to be in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>

more cars there.</p>

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Burnhams were getting divorced. Mrs. Burnham sued for divorce in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>. While Mr. Burnham, the appellant, was in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> briefly he was served process.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Procedural Posture: </span></b
        ><span>Burnham made a special appearance in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> to try to quash service of process on the grounds that </span

          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          did not have personal jurisdiction over him due to insufficient
          contacts. The Superior Court denied his motion, and the California
          Court of Appeal agreed. Burnham appealed to the United States Supreme
          Court.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          If a defendant is served process within a state�s borders, does due
          process require a connection between the lawsuit and the defendant�s
          contacts within the state?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          NO MAJORITY RULE. Scalia�s bunch says that it is sufficient that the
          defendant be physically present for </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          to have personal jurisdiction. Brennan�s bunch agrees that </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          has jurisdiction, but in deciding this you must consider minimum
          contacts and fair play factors.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          Scalia says that most of the big cases have asked the Supreme Court to
          find out whether a state has jurisdiction over an absent defendant.
          Now they have to figure this out for an
          <i>actually physically present</i> defendant. Scalia says that courts
          basically have always had jurisdiction over physically present
          defendants and ought to continue to have such jurisdiction. Scalia
          also rejects the argument that
          <i><a href="shaffervheitner.html">Shaffer</a></i> says that
          <i>all</i> questions of personal jurisdiction should be evaluated
          according to
          <i><a href="internationalshoecovwashington.html">Shoe</a></i
          >. Scalia points to the language in <i>Shaffer</i> and says it only
          applied to <i>absent</i> defendants.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Brennan says that just because something has been the law for a long
          time doesn�t mean it�s just or right. Brennan interprets the ruling in
          <i>Shaffer</i> to mean that really <i>all</i> personal jurisdiction
          rules must be evaluated according to minimum contacts and fair play,
          even �ancient� rules.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The fact that physical presence has been sufficient for personal
          jurisdiction for so long, Brennan argues, means that someone who goes
          to California has �clear notice� that they can be served process
          there.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Brennan further says that by being in a state at all, you get some
          benefit from the protection of its laws, and it�s clear that it was
          convenient for you to travel there at least once. Thus, he argues,
          it�s only fair that you be subject to its jurisdiction.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Scalia counters by saying that the benefits which Brennan mentions
          are too cheap, or else could be plausibly cheap in such a way that you
          couldn�t draw a clear line. Scalia finally says that if people want
          physical presence not to constitute jurisdiction anymore, the
          legislature should pass a law, and the judiciary shouldn�t
          meddle.</span

          should have jurisdiction. I don�t think it�s wrong for them to agree
          on the result of <i>this</i> case, but they might disagree on the
          result of a <i>different</i> case. I think the <i>result</i> of the
          case is easy; I don�t think the Court took the case to produce an
          earth-shattering result. They wanted to talk about personal
          jurisdiction. I suppose Brennan�s decision would be the easiest to
          turn into a dissent if he actually agreed with Scalia�s opinion that
          there was a lack of minimum contacts.</span

            like a person can. Thus, unless you�re in the state of incorporation
            or the state where the corporate headquarters is located, the
            corporation will never be <i>physically</i> present in your state,
            no matter what. In other words, it will <i>always</i> be an
            <i>absent</i> defendant. Maybe we should consider whether the legal
            fiction of the corporation as a person is fair and useful or whether
            we ought to treat corporations differently.</span

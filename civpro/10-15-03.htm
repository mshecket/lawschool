<p><span>We
spent yesterday with <i><a href="masvperry.htm">Mas</a></i>. We learned that, at least in certain
circumstances, the statute (<a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html">28 U.S.C. § 1332</a>) provides
for diversity jurisdiction, while in others, it provides some roadblocks.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
case of Jean-Paul v. Peeper was simple. But if we add Judy, and she comes from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> like Peeper, then the Rule
of Complete Diversity would be violated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Note
that this rule is not <i>constitutional</i>. It is purely <i>statutory</i> and thus can be adjusted by other statutes. For example, the Federal Interpleader Act
requires only <i>minimum diversity</i> of the parties in order for federal courts
to have jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Hypotheticals</span></b></p>

  >Japan</span></i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i><span> </span></i><span>– Let’s say the
amount-in-controversy requirement is satisfied. Let’s take a look at <a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html">§ 1332</a> and see if
one foreigner can sue another foreigner in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> federal court. There is no diversity jurisdiction for this
lawsuit, because it doesn’t fit into any of the four “prongs” enumerated in
sub-section (a).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>Guy
from </span></i><st1:State><st1:place><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

  >Mexico</span></i></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> – Under what section could
the federal courts have diversity jurisdiction? It’s not the first prong, § 1332(a)(1), because we don’t have “citizens
of different States”. It <i>is </i>the
second prong, § 1332(a)(2), because we have a “citizen of a State” and some
foreign dudes.</span></p>

  >Japan</span></i></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> – Is there a place for this
situation in the statute? Do we have “different
states” involved here? Is there a policy
consideration here? We want to make sure
that two foreign defendants can’t storm into our court just by joining a single
solitary party in our country. But if it
falls anywhere, it must come under § 1332(a)(2). So what do we do here? It turns out that the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Mexico</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> dude and the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> guy are <i>non-diverse
parties</i>. In a sense, we treat “everybody
else” as one big foreign state. Aliens
is aliens is aliens. The exception is
the previous case, which falls under § 1332(a)(3). That sub-section <i>explicitly</i> allows all
the foreign dudes you want on both sides <i>so far as</i> you have citizens
from different states on each side as well.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="saadehvfarouki.htm">Saadeh v. Farouki</a></span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case seems to have more than its fair share of complexities. It involves not just § 1332, but
interpretation of that statute and splits between Circuits in such
interpretation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>What’s
happening in this case? </span></i><span>Farouki’s a businessman who
borrowed money from Saadeh and defaulted on his loan. When the suit was filed, Saadeh was Greek and
Farouki was a permanent resident of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> residing in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Farouki is still a Jordanian citizen, though. Farouki later becomes a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> citizen, but the court will
say that it doesn’t matter.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Saadeh
sues Farouki in federal district court in D.C. The theory is that the federal courts will have diversity jurisdiction. However, look back at the hypothetical we did
earlier. Isn’t it true that we don’t
allow an alien to sue another alien in our federal courts? What’s different here? Farouki is a permanent resident.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Saadeh
relies upon the plain meaning of the last sentence of § 1332(a), which says:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span>“For purposes of this section…an alien admitted to
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> for permanent residence
shall be deemed a citizen of the State in which the alien is domiciled.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
we end up with a citizen of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Greece</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> versus (we think) a citizen
of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Isn’t this
what the statute says?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Farouki,
however, argues that there is no jurisdiction. The district court denied his motion, and Saadeh won on the merits. Farouki appeals on the merits of the case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court <i>itself</i> (sua sponte) raises the jurisdictional question and asked
for briefs on the issue of subject matter jurisdiction. The court ultimately concludes that there is
no subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity. There is <i>something</i> fishy about that
last sentence: it seemed to apply, but now something is amiss.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
Saadeh’s case is dismissed, what can he do? He could refile in federal court because Farouki is now a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> citizen! This is why Farouki doesn’t bother to argue jurisdiction. If he wins, he loses!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>What
does the court examine in rejecting the plain language of § 1332(a)?</span></i><span> What is it about this section that troubles
the D.C. Circuit? If we just sort of
read it, it seems pretty clear. The D.C.
Circuit is going to tell us that <i>it doesn’t mean what we think it means</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>Are
there other doctrines that the D.C. Circuit is concerned about?</span></i><span> The court claims that there is a “formidable constitutional
difficulty”. What is it? The court is concerned that the Constitution does
not allow suits between two foreign litigants.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
is illustrated in this case is a clear, modern example of the textualist v.
pragmatist debate. Textualists say you
should use the plain language of the statute and only use what the statute <i>says</i>. Pragmatists say that you should weigh the
result of the statute as well as the legislative history and intent.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court looks at the intent of the sentence in question and finds that the
purpose was to “pour people out of court”. Therefore, the court says that we should only apply the plain language
of the sentence if it will work to limit the scope of diversity jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>Guy
from </span></i><st1:State><st1:place><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></i></st1:place></st1:State><i><span> v. French citizen who is a
permanent resident alien of the </span></i><st1:country-region><st1:place><i><span
  >United States</span></i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i><span> residing in </span></i><st1:State><st1:place><i><span
  >Ohio</span></i></st1:place></st1:State><span> – Federal courts won’t have
diversity jurisdiction here! This is
what that little sentence was really for!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
Judge Rogers does is sort of add an interpretive caveat: the sentence applies
exactly when it will <i>limit </i>diversity jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Different
circuits have taken different positions on the interpretation of this statute. The Supreme Court doesn’t care much, because
the situation of <i><a href="saadehvfarouki.htm">Saadeh</a></i> doesn’t happen
much.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>“The
joy of getting cases reversed is that you get another bite at the apple.”</span></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Maybe
it wasn’t as complicated as we initially thought it was!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>At
the end of the case, Yeazell gives us a note on <i>amount in controversy</i>. All the stuff in § 1332 is predicated by the
requirement that the amount in controversy must <i>exceed</i> $75,000. This amount has changed over time to
(somewhat) keep pace with inflation. It
started out at $500 and was most recently raised from $50,000 to $75,000 in
1997. What is the purpose of increasing
the amount in controversy? This will
limit the federal caseload.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court is pretty liberal towards plaintiffs in checking their pleading for a
sufficient amount in controversy.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are two issues here:</span></p>

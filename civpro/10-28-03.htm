          What does that tell us? The Ohio Supreme Court is trying to resolve
          two of the biggest choice of law issues at once: choice of law in
          contracts, and choice of law in torts. The court says that from here
          on out, we�re adopting different standards, namely, the Restatement
          standards.</span

          that a product is not defective if the injury occurs more than 5 years
          after it is made. What�s the purpose of this statute? The product
          might get modified or damaged over time. It�s kind of far-fetched to

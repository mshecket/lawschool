<br/>

<p><b><span>Why
diversity jurisdiction?</span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
courts and Congress have tried to limit diversity jurisdiction in three
different ways. Congress could
conceivably do away with diversity jurisdiction altogether.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
keep diversity jurisdiction around for reasons of tradition as much as
anything. Also, litigating in federal
court is desirable, and lawyers like having the option of getting their cases
into federal court through diversity jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Supplemental
jurisdiction – getting more jurisdiction than you thought</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>To
this point, we’ve looked at several ways the courts and Congress have tried to
limit the number of cases getting into federal courts. Now, we’re going to take things that wouldn’t
ordinarily be in federal court and see if we can find a basis for getting them
in. This now done by statute, but in
order to understand the statute, we need to look at the case that the statute
attempts to codify.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span><a

line-break'>
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![endif]></span></p>

<p><span>Gibbs
sues the United Mine Workers. He had a
federal claim and a state tort claim. He
has a “mixed body” of claims.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
come we don’t have diversity jurisdiction? Where is the union <i>from</i>? It’s
from where all its members are from.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Can
a federal court have jurisdiction over a claim with non-diverse parties? Where should this suit be brought, if not in federal
court? It could be brought in state
court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
does the Supreme Court tell us? The
answer is that yes, the federal court <i>can</i> hear this case and the state
law claim inside it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>What
rationale does the Court use to justify federal jurisdiction in this case?</span></i><span> What is it about this “clump” of federal and
state claims that makes it constitutional for the federal courts to hear it?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span><a
href="unitedmineworkersvgibbs.htm">Gibbs</a></span></i><span> is to supplemental jurisdiction as <i><a
href="pennoyervneff.html">Pennoyer</a></i> is to personal jurisdiction. This is a very important case that you have
to <i>remember forever</i>. It gives us
a phrase that we will see <i>over and over</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span><a
href="unitedmineworkersvgibbs.htm">Gibbs</a> </span></i><span>is a <i>constitutional </i>case. <i><a href="unitedmineworkersvgibbs.htm">Gibbs</a></i>
says that Article III’s delegation of federal judicial power relates to <i>cases</i>
and <i>controversies</i> rather than <i>claims</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In <i><a
href="louisvillenashvillerailroadvmottley.htm">Mottley</a></i>, the Supreme
Court interpreted the language in regard to “arising under” jurisdiction and
gave us the well-pleaded complaint rule. In <i>Mas</i>, the Supreme Court interpreted the constitution to give us
the complete diversity rule.</span></p>

<br/>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span>Brennan says: “<i>The state
and federal claims must derive from a common nucleus of operative fact.</i>”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
phrase is not very helpful <i>in itself</i>, but as we go over its
applications, it begins to take on a life of its own. We look at claims and think about whether we
would normally expect to try them together in the same judicial proceeding. <i>Does it make sense to try these claims
together? Does it make a sensible trial
package?</i></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
details might you look at to make such a determination?</span></p>

working with two different bodies of law at once.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Courts
will have some discretion in deciding whether to hear these claims.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>These
concepts are old and have been subsumed by § 1367. We need to know the old stuff because there
are a lot of old lawyers and judges out there who only know the old way of
doing things.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Pendant
jurisdiction</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you have federal question jurisdiction to anchor the case, and you have an
additional state law claim, then, provided that the claims come out of a “common
nucleus of operative fact”, then you can hear them together. This is essentially the situation in <i><a
href="unitedmineworkersvgibbs.htm">Gibbs</a></i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Ancillary
jurisdiction</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>If
you have diversity jurisdiction, will it cover additional claims over other
parties? Let’s say you have a good federal
diversity claim, but the defendant makes a third-party claim against a
third-party defendant who is not diverse.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Pendant
party jurisdiction</span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you have federal question jurisdiction, can you make state law claims against
additional parties if the claims come out of a “common nucleus of operative
fact”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
the good thing is that all three of these types of jurisdiction now fall under <a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1367.html">§ 1367</a> and the
contemporary concept of supplemental jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span><a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1367.html">28 U.S.C. § 1367</a>
takes the concepts from <i><a href="unitedmineworkersvgibbs.htm">Gibbs</a></i>
and tries to apply them to provide for the same kind of supplemental jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span><a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1367.html">§ 1367(a)</a> is the
grant of supplemental jurisdiction, which is essentially a codification of <i><a
href="unitedmineworkersvgibbs.htm">Gibbs</a></i>.</span></p>

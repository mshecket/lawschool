          electric company for having the power line that close to a landing
          strip. The plaintiff and the power company are non-diverse parties.
          The Supreme Court said that <i>Finley</i> barred pendant party
          jurisdiction unless there was an independent basis for it. � 1367
          tried to <i>undo</i> this result and allow pendant party jurisdiction

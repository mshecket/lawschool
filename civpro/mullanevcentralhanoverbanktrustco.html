<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Don’t know, and don’t
care. No, seriously…there’s this fund,
and this stuff, and then something happens. There are people who they can find, and people who they can’t find. They publish something in a newspaper in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> without their names, just
letting them know that something is coming up in court with regard to this common
trust fund. An attorney who is appointed
to represent the interests of absent beneficiaries tries to argue that this
constructive notice is unconstitutional.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Procedural
Posture:</span></b><span>
The New York Surrogate’s Court held that the notice given was okay. This decision was affirmed by the intermediate
appellate court and the Court of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> May a state
constitutionally dispense with personal service of process even if it knows how
to contact a defendant?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> A method of service of
process must either be (1) “reasonably certain” to provide actual notice, or
(2) the lesser of several evils, that is, a “feasible” form of notice that is “not
substantially less likely” to give actual notice than other options.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The Court says that you can’t
just go through the <span class=GramE>motions,</span> you actually have to try
to let people know something’s going on in court they ought to pay attention
to.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The Court ruled that constructive
notice for unknown persons is constitutionally OK, but that constructive notice
for <i>known </i>persons is unconstitutional. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</span></p>

dir=LTR><span>It seems that
the court cares about whether it appears you sincerely intend to give other
parties notice of a pending lawsuit or if you’re just going through the motions. If you need to give someone notice in </span></span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Alaska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and you’re in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Hawaii</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, mail would probably be
okay. However, if you’re in <span
class=SpellE>Drinko</span> and you need to give notice to someone at the </span><st1:place><span
 >Union</span></st1:place><span>, you should probably walk
over and serve them personally. I don’t
think this decision bans service of process by regular mail at all. I think it can be deemed adequate based on
the circumstances. I think you’d be
safer with certified mail, though. On
the other hand, the present case deals with a “large number of small interests”
rather than a small number of large interests. The bigger the interest, perhaps, the greater the need for personal
service.</span></p>

dir=LTR><span>The rule seems
to be that you either need to provide adequate actual notice, or pick the least
bad of your “feasible” constructive alternatives. Individual notice may not be necessary if it
is onerously expensive and there exists an alternative form of notice that is
much cheaper, yet only a little less likely to provide actual notice. I think, in the end, the court simply has to
balance the competing interests of fairness and efficiency just like they always
do.</span></span></p>

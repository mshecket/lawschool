<p><i><span>World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson</span></i></p>

<p><span>444
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 286 (1980)</span></p>

<p><span>Yeazell,
p. 119-126</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:
</span></b><span>Somebody
bought a car from a car dealership in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They got into a car accident in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> where the fuel tank
exploded.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They started a product
liability suit against the present appellants and others in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Procedural
Posture:</span></b><span> The
car dealer and regional distributor put in a special appearance to argue that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> did not have jurisdiction
under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court of Oklahoma denied their
writ and the appellants went to the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:
</span></b><span>Can a state
court exercise <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation
when the only connection between the defendants and the forum is that the car
they sold in their state got into an accident in the forum state?<b> </b></span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:
</span></b><span>In order
for a state court to exercise <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction over a defendant,
there must exist minimum contacts between the defendant, forum, and claim.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court finds that the
contacts between the defendant and the forum are not sufficient to sustain jurisdiction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They argue that if they allow the defendants
to stand trial in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> for problems with their
car, anyone that sells anything will have to be subject to jurisdiction
anywhere that the products might go.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Justice
Brennan dissents, making an <span class=GramE>argument that states’ rights and plaintiffs’
rights</span> are being inappropriately underweighted against defendants’
rights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Brennan argues that cars have a
special status among products because it’s expected that they will move
themselves into other jurisdictions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally,
Brennan cites changes in insurance, transportation and communications which
make it relatively easy and inexpensive for any defendant to appear in virtually
any forum.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:
</span></b><span>The court
rules that the appellants have no contacts with </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and thus it reverses the judgment
of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma.</span></p>

in federal court instead and name all the defendants in one fell swoop.<span

seem to find multiple lawsuits undesirable: “Sue first, ask questions later.”</span></p>

money.</span></span></p>

        <b><span>Issue preclusion</span></b
        ><span></span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"

          preclusion. It�s issue preclusion that we will move into today.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the issue of issue preclusion? There are two parts to an
          issue. An issue consists of (1) the legal and factual proposition
          (like negligence, breach, theft, etc.) and (2) the procedural setting,
          including burdens of proof and access to information. That second
          prong is often overlooked.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If the procedural setting doesn�t provide similar sorts of
          protections, then issue preclusion, in general, won�t apply even if
          it�s an identical factual situation being litigated.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say the government wants to prosecution an IRS agent for theft. Let�s
          say the government starts with a criminal action, and the end result
          is an acquittal. Can the government then turn around and, in a civil
          action, sue the IRS agent for recovery of the money, or is there
          preclusion? What would make the procedural setting so critically
          different that there would not be preclusion? Why can the government
          sue the guy in a civil action? The burden of proof in a criminal court
          is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">way different</i> than in
          the civil system. Acquittal in criminal court doesn�t mean very much
          factually when you look at it in civil court. The burden of proof in
          civil court is simply �preponderance of the evidence�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if we take the same situation, except we do the civil action
          first and the government wins. What�s the effect on a subsequent
          criminal trial? Is there preclusion? No! You need a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">higher </i>burden of proof in
          the criminal court, so you have to try the issue over again.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Something must be precluded, though. What if we convict the guy in
          criminal court? Then in civil court, we�ve already shown by a
          preponderance of the evidence that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">he dunnit</i>. This is where
          issue preclusion comes in. The government will use issue preclusion so
          that it doesn�t have to relitigate the issue of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">theft</i>.</span

          has a different type of tort law at this time that described the �loss
          of consortium� claim as a �subset� of Bertha�s claim rather than as a
          portion of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Jesse�s</i> claim.
          This suit would be claim-precluded in most jurisdictions!</span

        <span
          >In issue preclusion, one of the main things you have to be able to
          discern is what has

        <span
          >So in the first lawsuit, what did the goose egg for Jessie really
          mean? What is it likely that the zero damages meant under these facts?
          It might have meant that the jury thought that Jessie was
          contributorily negligent, or the jury might have thought that Jessie
          wasn�t contributorily negligent but that he suffered no actual
          damages.</span

          for personal injuries. Could there be issue preclusion here? Nope, for
          the same reason as in

        <span
          >What if, in a bench trial, the court found that Jessie was
          contributorily negligent
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and </i>Jessie has no damages.
          Aha! Now we have specificity. How will this play out? It depends on
          which Restatement of Judgments the jurisdiction follows.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In a bizarre shift, the first Restatement says that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">all </i>litigated and decided
          issues are precluded from relitigation. However, the second
          Restatement says that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">no </i>issues are precluded
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">if </i>the judgment rests on
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">alternative grounds</i>. The
          shift has to do with the dynamics of litigation. When a court issues
          grounds of alternative rulings, it can sometimes be a �CYA� opinion,
          and it�s less likely that all of those grounds are sustainable. For
          this reason, the second Restatement will preclude all of them.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s say an appellate court upholds both findings of fact from the
          trial court. Then both issues are precluded from future litigation. If
          the court upholds only one finding, then only that issue is precluded.
          If the appellate court upholds one issue but doesn�t reach the other
          one, it can only preclude the first.</span

        ><span>
          was the last case Professor Wright argued before the Supreme Court. If
          the federal district court grants a motion to dismiss for lack of
          subject matter jurisdiction (but doesn�t reach the issue of personal
          jurisdiction), could the plaintiff file his case in state court? Sure.
          Why no preclusion? The issues are radically different between the
          issues of subject matter jurisdiction in the federal courts and
          general jurisdiction in the state courts.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if the federal district court dismisses for lack of personal
          jurisdiction? Would there be preclusion there? What was litigated as
          to personal jurisdiction? It�s the defendant�s contacts with the forum
          and the fair play five, or maybe the long-arm statute. Would personal
          jurisdiction in federal court be decided any differently than in a
          state court? No! There�s 100% symmetry of the issues. This is the best
          example of preclusion in terms of the stuff we�ve looked at. You�ve
          had a chance to argue personal jurisdiction in the federal court, and
          you�ve lost! You don�t get another chance to argue personal
          jurisdiction in state court!</span

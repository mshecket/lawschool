          <i>no genuine issue of material fact</i>. If there is an issue of
          fact, the summary judgment must be denied because the factfinder gets
          to resolve that factual dispute. Summary judgment says that there�s
          nothing to trial because all the facts are clear and if we accept
          those facts they do not amount to a recoverable claim.</span

          They can look at the requests for production of documents. Those
          documents form evidence that you can use at this stage. The
          depositions will create transcripts that you can use as evidence at
          this stage. You can also use interrogatories and requests for
          admissions. Most importantly, affidavits are <i>very</i> important. At
          minimum, you as the attorney will have to write an affidavit that the
          copies you submitted as evidence were �true and correct� copies of the
          documents given to you.</span

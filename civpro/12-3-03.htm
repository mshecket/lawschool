<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Res</span></span><span>
<span class=SpellE>judicata</span> broadly includes claim preclusion, or <i>true</i>
<span class=SpellE>res</span> <span class=SpellE>judicata</span>, and also issue
preclusion, or collateral estoppel. The
easy thing to do is to call the whole thing <i>preclusion</i> and call the
sub-things claim preclusion and issue preclusion.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Claim
preclusion looks at whole claims, while issue preclusion looks at <i>portions</i>
of a claim where issues of law or fact have already been determined; those
issues are then binding on the parties in future litigation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
say we have an accident. Fairman sues
Wines for negligence and the jury finds for Wines. <span class=GramE>Wines wins</span> on the
merits. Fairman decides to go to federal
court and sues Wines again. It will be judgment
for Wines again! Why? The claim has been done already! This is so simple that people don’t even try
it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if Fairman wins in the first case, and thus he’s won on the <span class=GramE>merits.</span> What if he goes to federal court and files
the same lawsuit again to see if he can get more money? Wines must win the second lawsuit because <span
class=SpellE>Fairman’s</span> already gotten all that he can get. He only gets one bite at the apple. That’s the easy case.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="friervcityofvandalia.htm"><span class=SpellE>Frier</span> v. City of
Vandalia</a></span></i></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
we have a somewhat more interesting case. <span class=SpellE>Frier</span> parked his car on a narrow street and
forced people to drive onto someone else’s lawn. He did this with a bunch of cars. Crappy cars! What does the city do? They just
wanted the alleyway cleared, they didn’t really want to hassle Charlie <span
class=SpellE>Frier</span>. Instead of
being happy with this treatment, <span class=SpellE>Frier</span> sues the hell
out of them!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>First,
he sues for replevin in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> state court. We’ve seen replevin before in <i><a
href="fuentesvshevin.htm">Fuentes</a></i>. <span class=SpellE>Frier</span> loses this case on the merits. The city was found to be justified in what
they did.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Frier</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> sues the city in federal court under § 1983, which is where many civil
rights sues arise. This lawsuit gets
dismissed for failure to state a claim (which was wrong, actually). That’s a <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule12.htm">Rule 12(b<span
class=GramE>)(</span>6)</a> motion! Why
is it wrong? The Court of Appeals says
that it should have been summary judgment and not this type of dismissal. The court can’t look at a transcript when it’s
dealing with a 12(b) motion. Those motions
have to be resolved on the <i>pleadings</i>. If the court looks at other stuff, the court should convert the motion
to a summary judgment motion. The result
is the <span class=GramE>same,</span> it’s just that the district court judge
uses the wrong procedure.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
law applies here? <a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1738.html">28 U.S.C. § 1738</a>
says judicial proceedings have full faith and credit. State court judgments have to be credited in federal
court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
don’t we look at the federal common law of claim preclusion? Isn’t this an <i><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i> thing? We look to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law to see if the second
lawsuit is precluded. Wright tells us
that state court judgments have the same preclusive effect in federal court
that it would have had in the state that entered that judgment. This rule is pieced together from § 1738 and
also Supreme Court interpretation like in <i>Allen v. <span class=SpellE>McCurry</span></i>,
which flat out tells us that we use the preclusion effect of the state court judgments
of the state when the judgment was entered. It’s an <i><a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i>-type
doctrine. But this isn’t a diversity
action, so it’s not <i>really <a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
we shall use </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> preclusion law. What does </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> tell us about
preclusion? It says that there is
preclusion when parties and causes of action are identical. How can we tell if the causes of action are
identical? They’re identical if they
would be supported by the same <span class=GramE>evidence,</span> or the same “common
core of operative facts” (c.f. <i><a href="unitedmineworkersvgibbs.htm">Gibbs</a></i>
<span class=SpellE>kinda</span>).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
had a replevin action. The replevin
requires proof that property was taken without “lawful process”. What evidence would we need to prove
that? We need to prove that <span
class=SpellE>Frier</span> owned the cars (that’s easy). We also need to prove that the city didn’t
offer an adequate process or hearing.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
what do we need to prove in the § 1983 case? We want to prove that the city deprived <span class=SpellE>Frier</span>
of his property without due process. Isn’t
it the very same evidence? We show he
owned the cars, and we show that the city didn’t offer adequate pre- or
post-deprivation process.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Easterbrook
says: the federal claim is precluded because it rests on the same evidence as
the already decided case!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
a tricky fact. There were four cars
towed, but the replevin only dealt with two, while the § 1983 action dealt with
all four. Does that matter? No, because we turn to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, which says that if you’ve
litigated a subset of all the available disputes, the rest will be
precluded. In other states, there is a
transactional test. Some states wouldn’t
have applied the same symmetry. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, however, it didn’t make a
difference.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Illinois
preclusion law versus the Restatement</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
<span class=SpellE>Swygert’s</span> problem? Why doesn’t he agree? He
concurs. He disagrees with the
application of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> that the majority uses. He says that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law doesn’t use the
Restatement transactional test. That
test bars claims based on transactional analysis: a <i>series of occurrences</i>. Even if you have other legal theories or
remedies, you can’t take another bite at the apple. It’s not whether the causes of actions are
the same <span class=GramE>precisely,</span> it’s whether they rest on the same
“building blocks”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
would <span class=SpellE>Frier</span> need to prove in the replevin action that
he didn’t have to prove in the constitutional action? <span class=SpellE>Swygert</span> says that
in the replevin action, he has to give proof whether he was parked
legally. However, in the constitutional
action, it doesn’t matter whether he’s parked illegally. You can be as illegally parked as you want to
be. If you’re arguing that there must be
some process before they take your car, it doesn’t matter whether you are
legally or illegally parked!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The
policy behind claim preclusion</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
can you justify barring the “<span class=SpellE>relitigation</span>” of a claim
that was <i>never actually litigated? </i>What’s
the policy reason? Could <span
class=SpellE>Frier</span> have raised his constitutional argument in the first
state lawsuit? Sure!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
plaintiff is the master of his own complaint. He could have brought his claims all together if he wanted, but he didn’t. It’s his own fault that he doesn’t get his
day in court! It’s all about efficiency!!!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if the plaintiff couldn’t bring the other cause of action in the first
lawsuit? Should there be preclusion? No! If
you <i>can’t</i> bring all your claims together, you shouldn’t be penalized for
not doing it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
<span class=SpellE><i>Frier</i></span> is limited to seeking $15,000 in his
first suit. Can he bring a second civil
rights suit for $1,000,000 and not have it precluded? He can’t bring both claims to municipal
court. But why didn’t he just bring both
claims to a different court? He <span
class=SpellE>shoulda</span>! We will
preclude him! The plaintiff had a choice
here. It’s not that the municipal court
doesn’t provide him complete <span class=GramE>relief,</span> it’s that the plaintiff
had a choice of which court to go to.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if there’s a special replevin statute that requires that replevin actions be litigated
on a special fast track in a “replevin court”? Is the second civil rights suit precluded? No way! If you’re forced initially into a forum that won’t let you bring all
your claims, then you shouldn’t be barred from bringing them later. The difference between the two cases is the
different between <i>choice</i> and <i>being compelled</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if we have the facts in <i><a href="friervcityofvandalia.htm"><span
class=SpellE>Frier</span></a></i>, but then <span class=SpellE>Frier</span>
sues to get a refund on his property taxes from the city. Is this claim precluded? Nope.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if <span class=SpellE>Frier</span> brings a third action, alleging that the
officer damaged his vestibule when he left a <span class=GramE>note.</span> Is this claim precluded? No, but the argument could be made from a
transactional standpoint that there could be preclusion. But it seems that there is enough “separateness”
and enough difference in evidence that is to be used that we will not preclude
in this case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>One
more! Say one of <span class=SpellE>Frier’s</span>
cars is really his wife’s. Say <span
class=SpellE>Frier</span> goes through the replevin action. Can the wife sue under § 1983? Is she precluded? Claim preclusion relates to claims filed by
parties. She wasn’t a party in the first
lawsuit, and thus her <i>lawsuit</i> isn’t barred by <i>claim preclusion</i>. However, there may be an issue preclusion
issue…</span></p>

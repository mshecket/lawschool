Assurance Co.</span></i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>927 F.2d 163 (4th Cir. 1991)</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Yeazell, pp. 43-47</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Facts:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> Houchens’s husband disappeared in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Thailand</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> and was never seen again. He had two life insurance policies, and
Houchens wanted them paid out. The
problem was that the policies required Mr. Houchens die in an accident in order
to pay out. Houchens sued American Home
Assurance for breach of contract, but AHA argued that there was no way to prove
that Mr. Houchens died in an accident.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Procedural Posture: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>AHA got summary judgment from the district court. Houchens appealed to the Fourth Circuit.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Issue:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> Did the district court err in granting summary judgment
to AHA?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Rule:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> Summary judgment shall be granted after discovery
against a party that fails to show they could establish some essential element
of their case which they have the burden to prove at trial.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Analysis:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> At trial, the burden would be on Mrs. Houchens to
prove that Mr. Houchens is dead and that his death was an accident.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The court concedes that under
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> law, Mr. Houchens is dead because he’s been missing
for over seven years. However, the court
finds Mrs. Houchens’s case for establishing his death as an accident to be
inadequately thin.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Mrs. Houchens relies on three
cases where people died under bizarre circumstances and were ruled dead by
accident. The court distinguishes these
cases by saying that there were no bizarre circumstances surrounding Mr.
Houchens’s death. In fact, there were <i>no
circumstances at all</i>. Therefore, the
court says that they cannot conclude that Mr. Houchens died accidentally. In fact, they say <i>no jury could reasonably
conclude</i> he died accidentally.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Conclusion:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> The order of summary judgment of the district court
is affirmed.</span></p>

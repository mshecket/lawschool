          Houchens wanted them paid out. The problem was that the policies
          required Mr. Houchens die in an accident in order to pay out. Houchens
          sued American Home Assurance for breach of contract, but AHA argued
          that there was no way to prove that Mr. Houchens died in an
          accident.</span

          <i>no circumstances at all</i>. Therefore, the court says that they

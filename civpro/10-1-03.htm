<p><span>We
finished up <a href="9-30-03.htm">last time</a> with <i><a
href="dee-kenterprisesincvheveafilsdnbhd.html">Dee-K</a> </i>as a case. The main thing we got out of it was the fact
that different provisions of the <a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1391.html">venue statutes</a> may
apply to different defendants.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Why
venue?</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
do we have venue? Stevie Y. thinks this
is a good question. What’s the need to
have a separate statute that just seems to mirror personal jurisdiction? It helps select where a case can be properly
brought. Isn’t that precisely what personal
jurisdiction does?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Fairman
says we do it because it’s the law! “There’s
a statute, so we have to follow it.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
Yeazell has a point: if we eliminated venue altogether, we wouldn’t have too
many problems since personal jurisdiction is pretty well-developed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Where
does venue fit into our decision tree of jurisdiction? What about notice and forum non conveniens? Are they preliminary matters, or matters to
be determined after the jurisdictional analysis? Fairman says that it doesn’t matter much.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>He
says that venue will almost always come after jurisdiction because no jurisdiction
usually means no venue either. In other
words, the venue test often collapses into the tests for personal jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about notice? There is constitutional
notice, but there are also state and federal service rules.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="piperaircraftvreyno.htm">Piper Aircraft v. Reyno</a></span></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p><span>What’s
the factual background? “This is a <i>superb
</i>case to end this unit on because it’s absolutely <i>chock-full</i> of neat
stuff related to procedure.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
plane full of Scots crash in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> and they die. The plane and its parts were manufactured in
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. The pilot was British or Scottish. The wreckage of the plane is in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
other companies were involved? There are
some companies in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> involved too.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
start out in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Apparently, under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, anyone can be the
administrator or administratrix of the estates of the dead people. That’s how Reyno gets involved. She first sues in the Superior Court of California. Why in the world would we have a case like
this litigated in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
is the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> a good place for the plaintiffs
to sue? Why is </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> the best in
particular? It’s the place with the laws
that are the most favorable to the plaintiffs.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
there any connection to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> other than the manufacturer
and parts supplier? No way! Everything else about this case is Scottish
or British.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a classic case of <i>forum shopping!</i> The plaintiffs’ attorneys specialize in looking for plane crashes all
over the world and litigating them in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. Probably this law firm went over to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> to solicit the business of
the decedents. These aren’t just ambulance-chasers,
they’re <i>airborne ambulance chasers!</i></span></p>

<p><b><span>A
catalog of strategic maneuvers</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
defense lawyers make three <i>brilliant</i> procedural moves:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span
dir=LTR><span>The defendants
removed the case from state court to federal court under <a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/pIVch89.html">28 U.S.C. §§ 1441-52</a>. Removal is something the defendants do when
the claim is something over which federal courts would have original jurisdiction.
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Why did the plaintiffs file this lawsuit
in state court instead of federal court? We know that the plaintiffs are forum shopping. But both courts will apply the same law. What is so great about state court? In <i><a
href="world-widevolkswagencorpvwoodson.html">World-Wide</a></i>, the
composition of the </span></span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> jury pool was more
desirable than that in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. What element of law does matter? If you file it in state court, it can’t get
transferred to a court in another state. If the case stays in state court, it gets <i>stuck</i> in state
court. It might be dismissed under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>’s version of forum non
conveniens, but it can’t be <i>transferred</i>. However, procedure doesn’t always allow plaintiffs who choose venue to
keep that choice.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>They win! The case goes to Scotland.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
case started in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> state court. It was removed to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> federal court. Then it was transferred to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> federal court. Finally, it was dismissed, but that dismissal
was reversed by the Third Circuit. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Then
the Supreme Court reverses again and let the case go to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. The victory of the defense at the trial court
level is vindicated and the case is indeed dismissed on the basis of forum non
conveniens.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
this is procedurally complicated! It’s
exciting!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
did the Third Circuit do wrong, according to the Supreme Court? The Third Circuit reversed on the ground that
the law would be less favorable to the plaintiffs in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> than in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>.</span></p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Marshall</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> says that you can’t weigh “change
of law” that heavily. He says that it
can be an element, but it’s not the end of the story.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Marshall</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> says, therefore, that you
can argue for a more convenient forum even when that forum would have law that
is less favorable to the plaintiff.</span></p>

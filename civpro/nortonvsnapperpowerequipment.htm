        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Norton was hurt while using a riding mower. He sued the manufacturer.
          After a trial, a jury found for the plaintiff on his product liability
          claim, but the judge entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict
          for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the district court err in granting judgment notwithstanding the
          verdict to the defendant?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          A court should grant judgment notwithstanding the verdict for the
          moving party only when it finds that, having taken the evidence as
          most favorable to the non-moving party, reasonable people could not
          possibly find for the non-moving party.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that even though the causation evidence in Norton�s
          favor is circumstantial, it is enough such that reasonable people
          could disagree about whether Norton has enough evidence to win.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The judgment notwithstanding the verdict is reversed and the case is
          remanded.</span

            >The trial court and the appellate court disagree on whether the
            lack of a �dead man� device is or could be a �defect�. The trial
            court seems to zoom in on the fact that the plaintiff must prove not
            only causation but also that it was a <i>defect</i> that caused the
            injury. The best evidence that the appellate court was right was
            that the jury <i>actually did</i> find for the plaintiff. The only
            way they could have done that and had their verdict correctly set
            aside would be if the jury itself was <i>unreasonable</i>.</span

            Court of Appeals says that the jury <i>could have</i> found that the

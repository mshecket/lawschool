So.2d 868 (</span><st1:address><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Fl. Dist. Ct. App.</span></st1:address><span> 1998)</span></p>

<p><span>Yeazell,
pp. 192-193</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Brown and her husband got
into an accident with Gibbons. Brown’s
husband was driving, and Gibbons allegedly gave him bad directions, causing the
accident. Gibbons, a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> resident, sued Mr. Brown in
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Two years
later, Mrs. Brown sues Gibbons in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, alleging that Gibbons is
subject to jurisdiction in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> because of the suit she
filed there earlier on the same subject matter.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Does the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> “Long-Arm” statute give the
state jurisdiction over Gibbons?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> shall have jurisdiction
over a defendant who is “engaged in substantial and not isolated activity” in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. This is construed to be a higher standard than
the federal constitutional one.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court assumes that the
first lawsuit is over, and thus finds that Gibbons is not <i>currently</i>
engaged in any activities in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The court says that brining a lawsuit in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> shouldn’t hang over your head
for the rest of your life.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The court dismisses Mrs.
Brown’s lawsuit.</span></p>

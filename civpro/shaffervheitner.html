        <b><span>Facts: </span></b
        ><span
          >Heitner was a shareholder in Greyhound who sued a number of officers
          of the company. He moved to �sequester� their property in Delaware.
          This property included the defendants� stock in Greyhound and other
          financial instruments. The motion was granted.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Procedural Posture:</span></b
        ><span>
          The suit and the sequestration motion were originally filed in the
          Delaware Court of Chancery. Service of process was made by certified
          mail and publication. The defendants made a special appearance to
          argue that under <i>Shoe</i>, the Delaware courts did not have
          personal jurisdiction over them because the defendants had
          insufficient contacts with the state. The </span

          ><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          courts ruled for the plaintiff, and the decision was appealed up to
          the U.S. Supreme Court.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Does the Delaware court have jurisdiction over the defendants or their
          property or both?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          <i>NEW RULE!</i> The <i>Shoe</i> model should be applied to
          jurisdiction <i>in rem</i> as well as <i>in personam</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          I think the Court is on <i>very</i> shaky ground, but maybe it only
          appears that way because the decision is so heavily edited. They
          basically seem to say �<i>Pennoyer</i> is old, and we think something
          different now, so we�re going to change the rules. So there.�</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court asserts that the true test of jurisdiction is the
          �relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation�.
          This had been the test for <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction since
          <i>Shoe</i>, and the Court says it should be extended to
          <i>quasi in rem</i> actions.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court argues that no <i>in rem</i> action is, strictly speaking,
          �thing-related�. There is always a person behind the thing they own
          who will be affected. The Court suggests that apply minimum contacts
          standards to <i>in rem</i> actions won�t change anything, because the
          simple fact that you own land or other big-time property in a state
          can be seen as sufficient proof that you have more than minimal
          contacts there.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court says that <i>quasi in rem</i> jurisdiction is going to have
          to change. The difference with <i>quasi in rem</i> is that the
          property in question isn�t really related to the subject of the
          plaintiff�s lawsuit. The Court will no longer allow the states to
          assert jurisdiction <i>merely</i> because somebody owns some property
          in that state.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court argues against Heitner�s assertion that the state of
          Delaware has an interest in controlling corporations that are formed
          within its borders. The Court says that the Delaware legislature
          didn�t seem to have this intent when it made the sequestration
          statute.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Heitner also suggests that the officers and directors of the company
          received benefits from the state of Delaware, and thus they should be
          subject to Delaware�s jurisdiction. The Court rejects this by saying
          the defendants had no relationship with the state whatsoever.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Powell concurs, but says that he favors preserving the traditional
          notion of <i>quasi in rem</i> jurisdiction for real property for
          efficiency purposes.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Stevens concurs, saying that buying stock should not be seen as
          consent to jurisdiction. He also states his fear that the decision
          goes further than is necessary.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Brennan concurs on three points and dissents on the last, saying the
          state has a compelling interest in maintaining a convenient forum for
          corporate disputes like the one in the present case. He favors using
          the standard that anyone who is under the protection of a state�s laws
          ought to be under the jurisdiction of that state.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion: </span></b
        ><span
          >The Court rules that Delaware does not have jurisdiction over the
          defendants, and therefore, it reverses the ruling of the Delaware
          Supreme Court.</span

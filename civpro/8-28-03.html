<p><span>“<i>There’s
a bell! I just had to ring it. My curiosity has been piqued.</i>”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We’ll
soon start picking things up and moving more quickly. We plan to finish <i><a

start on <i>Shaffer</i> on Tuesday.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Review</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>Shoe
</span></i><span>is a story
about the <i>Death of a Salesman!</i> Maybe it’s not that dramatic, but at least the Taxing of a Salesman.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> slaps a tax on <i>Shoe</i> to help fund an
unemployment compensation scheme to prevent Willy <span class=SpellE>Loman</span>-type
situations.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>We
have a brand new test for personal jurisdiction!</span></i><span> It’s the <i>minimum contacts test</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The
standard for personal jurisdiction in <i>Shoe</i></span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>What
does this standard <i>not </i>mean? Does
it have an effect on <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction? No.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Does
it have an effect on personal service within the state? Does it change the possibility of “gotcha”
service? No. <i>Stone explicitly excludes cases where the defendant
is not in the “territory of the forum”.</i></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the defendant is out of state, yet has certain <i>minimum contacts</i> within a
jurisdiction, we will determine whether that court has personal jurisdiction
based on “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice”. Great!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
the problem: <i>Shoe</i> does a poor job of explaining its terms, namely, “minimum
contacts” and “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The
<i>Shoe</i> model</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We’re
given a model of what an out-of-state defendant can do within a state that puts
that defendant under the personal jurisdiction of that state.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Think
about a graph of level of activity versus degree of <span class=SpellE>unrelatedness</span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
a defendant has “continuous and systematic contacts with a forum” that are
related to a claim. There’s no doubt
that the court has jurisdiction over such activities.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
the “high level of activity/low level of <span class=SpellE>unrelatedness</span>”
quadrant gives us jurisdiction, the “low level of activity/high level of <span
class=SpellE>unrelatedness</span>” quadrant gives us no jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about “high level of activity/high level of <span class=SpellE>unrelatedness</span>”? <i>It depends</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about “low level of activity/low level of <span class=SpellE>unrelatedness</span>”? <i>Again, it depends</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Think
about a shaded area under the line y = x.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
apply this vision to an automobile accident like <i>Hess v. <span class=SpellE>Pawloski</span></i>. You have a single, isolated contact with the
forum. You drive through the state once
and do a wrong. Even without the consent
idea, does the state have jurisdiction under the <i>Shoe</i> formulation? You have only one contact, but that contact
is highly related to the claim. If the
contact is really, really related, or the contact <i>is </i>the cause of
action, the state can have jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Therefore,
<i>Hess v. <span class=SpellE>Pawloski</span></i> fits into Justice Stone’s
vision.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
we apply the formulation to <i>Shoe</i>, the claim is highly related to <i>lots</i>
of contacts in the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. This case would fall in the “high contacts/low
<span class=SpellE>unrelatedness</span>” quadrant, and jurisdiction would
result.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Where
would <i>Pennoyer</i> fall onto this graph? In particular, think about <i>Mitchell v. Neff</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
was Neff’s contact with the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> forum? He was trying to acquire land there. He went to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and hired an attorney to
help him get land in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. That’s a contact. But is that continuous and systematic? Not really.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
how related is that contact to the claim Mitchell had against Neff? The case would fall into the “low contacts/low
<span class=SpellE>unrelatedness</span>” quadrant, and we must say “it depends”.<br

<p><b><span>General
vs. specific jurisdiction</span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
doesn’t come directly out of <i>Shoe</i>, but it’s a way that personal
jurisdiction is discussed today. This is
a different way of dividing the world of personal jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>General
jurisdiction is the idea that you have personal jurisdiction over all causes of
action, even those not arising out of contacts with your forum. This is the “upper right” on the graph.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Specific
jurisdiction, on the other hand, is jurisdiction over a specific claim in
question, though not necessarily other claims.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Which
of these two types of jurisdiction is going on in <i>Shoe</i>? The jurisdiction is only with respect to the
specific claim; this is specific jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
I go anywhere in the world and do something bad, anybody from anywhere can come
to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and sue me.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
same thing is true of corporations. There’s always somewhere that a corporation can be sued.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Also,
claim by claim, there may be individual forums where you may be subject to specific
jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the next few weeks, we’ll be asking the questions: 1. Does the court have specific
jurisdiction over the defendant? 2. Does
the court have general jurisdiction over the defendant?</span></p>

wrongful dismissal claim. But what about
general jurisdiction? The law recognizes
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> as the “state of corporate birth”. As a matter of law and fact, if you want to
sue a corporation in the state in which it is incorporated, <i>you can</i>. This is one reason so many corporations are
incorporated in the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

deal with corporate issues (<a href="http://courts.state.de.us/chancery/">Court

would have jurisdiction over one claim (the injury claim), but not the other
(the bond claim). What if the rancher
sues for both claims in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:

<br/>

<p><span>Shoe
did business in a lot of states other than </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. For Shoe, this is a tax case. They don’t care about jurisdiction. If </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> can tax Shoe, then every
state can tax Shoe. That’s really what
this case is about for Shoe, even though they carefully crafted their business
to avoid paying taxes in states other than </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Corporate

it. However, the law can change, like it

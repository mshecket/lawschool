<p>Yeazell, p. 3-5: “Procedure, Lawyers, and Clients”</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Steve says that most disputes that could end up as lawsuits
actually do not. The ones that get to
court, he says, are the exception to the rule.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When you hire a lawyer, you’re faced with a real human being
with conflicting interests and priorities. Sometimes your lawyer fails to act on your best interests because they’re
careless or they otherwise suck.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When a lawyer screws up, there are two main ways to fix
things:</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>You
     can let the lawyer correct their mistake after the fact.</li>
 <li style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>You
     can let the client sue the lawyer.</li>
</ol>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Each of these has plusses and minuses. If the lawyer is allowed to correct their
mistake, it will hurt the opposing side and make the system at large less
efficient. If the only way you let
people fix things is to let the client sue their own attorney, it means that
the client is in for an extra lawsuit and will incur more costs.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Steve says we’ll see the system grapple with this pair of
unattractive alternatives frequently.</p>

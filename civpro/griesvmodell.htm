<p><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Gries v. Modell</span></i></p>

<p><span>473
N.E.2d 807 (</span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> 1984)</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Gries and Modell (boooo!)
made a contract over the Cleveland Browns (a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> corporation) and then
either amended or replaced it according to what law applies. Gries sues for specific performance of the contract,
and Modell argues that he is not bound by the contract as modified because it
violates </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law. Gries
argues for the application of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, and Modell wants the
application of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law. The trial court found that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law governed and entered a judgment
for Gries. The court of appeals disagreed,
and hold that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law applies.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Should </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law or </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law apply to the contract
between Gries and Modell?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> case law sues the rule that
the law of the state where the contract is to be performed shall govern. The Restatement of Conflict of Laws gives several other factors,
including: (1) the place where the contract was made, (2) the place where the contract
was negotiated, (3) the place where the subject matter of the contract is
located, and (4) where the parties to the contract are located.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The Ohio Supreme Court
finds that based on either the existing rule or the Restatement rule, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law controls.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The judgment of the court
of appeals is reversed. I think the decision
of the trial court is to be reinstated.</span></p>

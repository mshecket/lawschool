<p><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Pennoyer </span></i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>is helping to sort out categories of jurisdiction in
the 19<sup>th</sup> century world. At
that point, you just had <i>in personam</i> and <i>in rem</i>. Today, we recognize the situation in <i>Pennoyer</i>
as “Type II” <i>quasi in rem</i> jurisdiction.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We’re mixing how Justice
Field would describe the situation with today’s analysis. For Field, the world was kind of black and
white.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Field said that for <i>in rem</i>
jurisdiction, you need to attach the property first, before the suit is
started. Or if you can personally serve
the defendant within the state, you can get <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>One exception: the idea of
consent. There are situations where an
individual can consent in advance to be brought under the jurisdiction of a court. That’s sort of a third variety that’s
implicit in Field’s contents.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Here come some
hypotheticals! Page 86, note 7.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We’re in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

style='font-size:14.0pt'>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A lives in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>. B is in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>North Dakota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A is going to sue B over a
piece of land in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Let’s say we serve B in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>North Dakota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>. B then files
a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. What’s
the result under <i>Pennoyer</i>? B wins
because B wasn’t served in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>. Notice isn’t what’s critical here. Even if you get real notice, a state has no
power outside its boundaries.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>How about the same thing,
except instead of filing the motion to dismiss, B just does nothing? A will get a default judgment in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>. A wants to
collect on his victory. He goes to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>North Dakota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>. He starts a
second suit to enforce the judgment. What will B do? B will say the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> court never had jurisdiction. This is precisely collateral attack; this is <i>Pennoyer</i>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What if A serves B while B is
on business in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>? The motion by
B to dismiss will be denied. B would be
under the jurisdiction of the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> court.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>How about the same thing,
where B is personally served in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, but instead of filing the motion to dismiss, B just
takes the default judgment? Now A files
a lawsuit in North Dakota to collect the judgment against B. A will prevail; the judgment will be
enforced. You better be right about your
jurisdictional argument. The idea is
that the Full Faith and Credit clause will apply (Article IV, §1). States have to recognize and enforce <i>valid</i>
judgments reached in other states.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This time, A attaches B’s
land first and obtains a judgment against B. B challenges the sale of the land on jurisdictional grounds. But B would lose, because once the land is
attached, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> has jurisdiction.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Next up, A serves process by
publication and doesn’t attach B’s land. B doesn’t respond and A gets a default judgment. A then sues B in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>North Dakota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> to enforce the judgment. B would win because the land wasn’t attached
and B was not personally served.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>How about a marriage
suit? Say you serve the spouse
personally in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>North
  Dakota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>. B files to dismiss for lack of personal
jurisdiction because B wasn’t served personally in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>. This motion
is denied. That’s because marriage is an
exception to the general rule. Why? Spouses leave, and you want them to be able
to sue them for divorce and go on with their lives.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>“<i>Marriage vitiates all
procedure</i>.”</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What about a suit for alimony
and child support? We personally serve B
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>North Dakota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, then B files a motion to dismiss in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>. Are marriage
and money the same? The motion to
dismiss will be granted. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> has no jurisdiction to get child support and
alimony. This is different today; we’ll
see in <i>Burnham</i>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Conceptually, think of <i>in
rem</i> as land. If you stop thinking
about <i>in rem</i> as land, you’ll get in trouble.</span></p>

<p><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Don’t forget, we’re

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What about the fishing trip

  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Wisconsin</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>? Say you
personally serve B on the fishing trip. B
files a motion saying he wasn’t in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, he was in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Wisconsin</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>. Now A tries

  14.0pt'>North Dakota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style='font-size:
14.0pt'>. B argues that the court in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> did not have jurisdiction, because B was not in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>. The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> court has fully and fairly litigated the issue. This is what we call <i>preclusion</i>, and
in particular, <i>issue preclusion</i>. Once you’ve had your day in court on an issue, you’re bound by the
findings of the court. When B went and
argued his motion to dismiss, he was consenting to the jurisdiction of the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> court for that issue.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Were there “special
appearances” in the time of <i>Pennoyer</i>? Yes, and that’s what we assume B does.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If B wanted some other forum
to decide the issue of personal jurisdiction, he should have argued jurisdiction
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>North Dakota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>. Or, B could

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A court has the responsibility
to raise subject matter jurisdiction at any point, even on appeal. In general, though, litigants have to bring
issues to courts’ jurisdiction. The
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12 set up the circumstances under which
someone can bring up these issues.</span></i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Quasi in rem</span></i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> jurisdiction wasn’t properly obtained in <i>Pennoyer</i>. Why did Field go on to talk about personal jurisdiction
when there wasn’t proper <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction in the first place? Field wants to give us his view of jurisdiction. He wants to ground it in the Constitution. Field makes <i>Pennoyer</i> an issue of constitutional
law. This becomes the foundation of
personal jurisdiction for some time to come.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Dicta are not law, but if
it is followed by other courts, it can become law.</span></i><span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Why did the federal court not
have to give full faith and credit to the state court in <i>Pennoyer</i>? Full Faith and Credit only applies between
states, not between a state and federal government. Today, there is a statute that says the
federal government must give full faith and credit to state rulings.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Furthermore, we only give
full faith and credit to judgments where there is due process.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What does due process mean in
the context of procedure? It is
necessary to establish jurisdiction. What does due process mean to Neff? What is due process? You need
service of process in order to have due process.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>You need a court that has
subject matter jurisdiction and you need the defendant to be served process
within that state, or else they must voluntarily appear.</span></p>

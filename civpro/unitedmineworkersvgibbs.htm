        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Gibbs was a manager who got in trouble with a union and was shut out
          of work. He sued the union for sort of conspiring to keep him out of
          the mining business. He had two theories and thus two claims: one
          state claim and one federal claim. The state claim was basically a
          tort claim, I think. The federal claim was based on a federal labor
          statute.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Procedural Posture: </span></b
        ><span
          >The federal district court said the federal statute didn�t really
          apply to the situation, but that the state claim was good to go. The
          United Mine Workers appealed eventually to the Supreme Court,
          apparently both on the merits and on the question of whether the
          district court had jurisdiction to hear the state claim.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Was it proper for the district court to exercise jurisdiction over the
          claim based on state law?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          NEW(ish) RULE!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>Whenever a
          federal claim that federal courts could properly hear under the
          �federal question� branch of subject matter jurisdiction is brought
          along with a state claim that comes out of the same facts as the
          federal claim, a federal court <i>may</i> (not <i>must</i>) exercise
          <i>pendant jurisdiction</i>.</span

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> There was a plane crash in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. The plane was manufactured by a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> company with parts made in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. A representative of the decedents, who lived
in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, filed lawsuits against the
two companies in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> because the laws here are
more favorable to plaintiffs than in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Procedural
Posture: </span></b><span>The defendants had the case
removed to federal court in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, then transferred to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and finally tried to get a forum
non conveniens dismissal. The federal district
court granted the motion, but the Third Circuit reversed on the ground that forum
non conveniens mustn’t be applied if it will cause the plaintiff to go to a
forum with less favorable law for the plaintiff. This decision, in turn, was appealed to the Supreme
Court.<b></b></span></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Should the trial court be
allowed to issue a forum non conveniens dismissal?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> A court has the authority
to decline jurisdiction if the suit may be brought more appropriately in
another forum.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> In deciding whether to dismiss
for forum non conveniens, a court must follow the rule of <i>Gulf Oil Corp. v.
Gilbert</i>, which says:</span></p>

public interest factors and private interest factors.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court finds that the district court applied the test correctly. In particular, it finds that forum non
conveniens cannot be inflexibly defeated merely on the basis that the
alternative forum would have laws less favorable to the plaintiff. The district court also ruled correctly that the
interests of foreign plaintiffs should be weighted less heavily than the
interests of domestic defendants.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Finally,
the Court acknowledges that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> has many contacts with the
litigation and that it would be best if it moved there.</span></p>

of Appeals was reversed.</span></p>

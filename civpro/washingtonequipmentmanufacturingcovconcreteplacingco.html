<p><span>85 </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Wash.</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> App. 240, 931 P.2d 170
(1997)</span></p>

<p><span>Yeazell,
pp. 148-149</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The defendant corporation
is based in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. To do business in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, it had to obtain a
certificate of authority and register an authorized agent. The defendant bought a machine from the plaintiff
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> but refused to pay full purchase price. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The plaintiff sued for the balance, but the trial
court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction. The plaintiff appealed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Did the defendant consent
to general personal jurisdiction when it got the certificate and registered an
agent?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> NEW RULE! In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, by statute, compliance
with mandatory requirements in order to do business in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> does not impose personal
jurisdiction on a foreign corporation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court analyzes the statute
and finds that the legislature chose to impose personal jurisdiction on foreign
corporations in some cases, but not in others, including the present case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The appellate court upheld
the trial court’s dismissal.</span></p>

          a Snapper mower. Somehow he gets his fingers snapped off by the mower
          blades. He sues Snapper for a couple of things: negligence, warranty,
          and product liability. He says that it was defective because it cut
          off his fingers.</span

          Snapper puts on its case. Then there�s a jury verdict and a judgment.
          In a typical trial, the jury verdict would be for or against the
          plaintiff, and then the judgment would embody some dollar amount the
          jury found.</span

          verdict. This procedure is important, yet weird, because you have to
          make the motion multiple times to preserve this �error�. At the end of
          Norton�s evidence, Snapper moved for a directed verdict. That is to
          say that they�ve already lost because they failed to put on some part
          of their case.</span

          the jury. The jury finds Snapper 80% responsible. Then Snapper moves
          for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and the court grants it!
          Why would the court grant this motion yet deny the other two which are

          How are they similar? They both view the evidence in the light most
          favorable to the nonmovant. The key similarity is that both take cases
          out of the hands of the jury. When you look at the standard they use:
          �no genuine issue as to any material fact� from
          <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule56.htm">Rule 56</a>
          versus �no legally sufficient evidentiary basis� from
          <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule50.htm">Rule 50</a
          >�Fairman says we can think of these two standards as the same.</span

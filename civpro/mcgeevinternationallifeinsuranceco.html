        <b><span>Facts: </span></b
        ><span
          >The plaintiff is the beneficiary of a life insurance policy for which
          the defendant refused to pay a claim. The defendant was based in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>, but the premiums were sent by mail from </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue: </span></b><span>Does the state of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> have specific jurisdiction over the defendant?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule: </span></b
        ><span>If the contact between the defendant and the state of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          is minimal, such contact must be closely related to the claim in order
          for the state of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> to have jurisdiction.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that the life insurance policy in question had
          substantial connection with the state of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. Furthermore, the court holds that the state has an interest in
          protecting its citizens without making them travel to other
          states.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion: </span></b
        ><span>It is suggested that the court ruled that </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> does have jurisdiction over the defendant.</span>

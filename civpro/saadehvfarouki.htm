v. Farouki</a></span></i></p>

<p><span>107
F.3d 52 (D.C. Cir. 1997)</span></p>

<p><span>Yeazell,
pp. 236-239</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The plaintiff is a Greek
citizen. The defendant is a permanent
resident of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> residing in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> but whose citizenship is
Jordanian. The plaintiff sued for breach
of contract in federal court, citing diversity jurisdiction, and prevailed on
the merits at trial.</span></p>

<p><span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></span></p>

<p><b><span>Procedural
Posture:</span></b><span>
The defendant appealed on the merits. The Court of Appeals asked the parties to write briefs on jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Did Farouki qualify as a
“citizen of a State” under <a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1332.html#1332.a">28 U.S.C. §
1332(a)</a>?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> The statute states that at
least one of the parties in a dispute must be a “citizen of a State” in order
for the federal courts to have diversity jurisdiction. Furthermore, the statute says that for the
purposes of the section in question “an alien admitted to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> for permanent residence
shall be deemed a citizen of the State in which such alien is domiciled”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court chooses to
liberally interpret the statute because it feels that a literal reading would
cause an undesirable and unintended result, that is, that federal diversity
jurisdiction could exist over a dispute involving <i>only foreign litigants</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court uses the legislative history to interpret the amendment to the statute as
a move to <i>narrow</i> federal diversity jurisdiction rather than <i>broaden</i>
it. The statute apparently was intended
to reduce the federal caseload. The
court finds that the statute was intended to eliminate federal diversity
jurisdiction between a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> citizen and a resident
alien living in the same state as that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> citizen.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The case was dismissed for
lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</span></p>

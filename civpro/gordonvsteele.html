<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Facts:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> Gordon is suing Steele and two other defendants for
medical malpractice that she claims took place in February of 1972. The defendants are citizens of Pennsylvania,
and so was the plaintiff, until at least August 9<sup>th</sup>, 1972, the date
that she enrolled in college in Idaho and rented an apartment. She filed a suit on </span><st1:date
Year="1973" Day="10" Month="4"><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>April 10<sup>th</sup>,
 1973</span></st1:date><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> in federal court. The defendants claimed that the federal court
did not have subject matter jurisdiction because Gordon was really a citizen of
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> on the date she filed the suit.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Issue:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> Can a student attending college in a different state
from her parents be considered a citizen of the new state for the purposes of
diversity jurisdiction?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Rule:</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> You must be a citizen of a different state as the
defendant on the day you file a suit to qualify for diversity
jurisdiction. It’s up to you, the
plaintiff, to prove that the parties are citizens of different states.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Analysis: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>The method of this judge is to chalk up the points for
Gordon being a citizen of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt'>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style='font-size:
14.0pt'> against points for her being a citizen of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>. Each side has
its points, but the court gives special weight to the fact that the plaintiff
explicitly says that she intends not to come back to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There is a contemporary issue
that is important in this case. In the
old days, students off at college out of state were not considered to have
“gained or lost a residence” by going to school there. One reason people thought that way was that
college students were generally financially provided for by their parents. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>At the time this ruling came
down, things were changing. The age of
majority was being lowered in many states to 18 from 21. This influenced the court in determining
whether or not Gordon was emancipated from her parents.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Conclusion: </span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>The court found as a matter of fact that Gordon was a
citizen of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> on the date she filed the suit. Therefore, the court denied the defendants’
motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span dir=LTR><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
court put a lot of weight on the plaintiff’s own statements saying she planned
to remain in </span></span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>. The court
said that since the intent to remain is so subjective, the best you can do is
take into account what the plaintiff says. The court is also interested that Gordon rented an apartment in Idaho,
because that shows she’s an independent grown-up type person and has her action
are in accordance with her statements that she intends to stay in Idaho. The court also mentions that it doesn’t
matter if she might move somewhere else someday. Finally, the court justifies ruling
differently on this issue than courts in the past by the fact that people who
are 18 are considered to be independent adults more and more by the law and
society.</span></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]><span dir=LTR><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The
court’s weighing of the facts is kind of subjective, but if Gordon lived in a
dormitory, it would at least tip the scales against her being a citizen of </span></span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> somewhat. If
she lived in a dorm, it could be argued that her actions didn’t support her
statements of her intent of where to live. A dorm is more temporary than an apartment, further on the scale between
a motel on the one hand and a fully paid for house on the other hand. I don’t think the court makes it clear enough
how important the apartment is to figure out how it would have ruled if she
lived in a dorm.</span></p>

is interesting, and you have to look closely at the quote from <i>Gallagher v.
Philadelphia Transportation Company</i>. The last sentence of that quote basically says that it doesn’t matter if
the plaintiff leaves the state or intends to leave the state later on, <i>so
long as</i> it doesn’t become apparent later that the plaintiff didn’t have the
intent to remain in the first place. The
defendants would argue, whether she moved back in six months or six days, that
she was insincere when she said she intended to remain in </span></span><st1:State><st1:place><span

what to do with the Peters case? Well,
the book seems to imply that Peters is better off filing the case when he gets
back to school. The only reason I can
think of off the top of my head for filing immediately is from Note 3b: if you
get the case going sooner, you’d have a better shot at getting in under the
statute of limitations in case you failed to prove diversity in federal
court. That would only be a week’s time
different, though. But when your guy
Peters gets to school…boy oh boy, he should go nuts getting an apartment and a
driver’s license and joining the local Rotary Club and going shopping for a
house and putting a big ad in the campus newspaper that says “I, AMBROSIA X.
PETERS, INTEND TO REMAIN A CITIZEN OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN FOREVER AND EVER!”</span></span></p>

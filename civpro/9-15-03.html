        <b><span>Minimum contacts as a threshold</span></b

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We�re two years before
          <i><a href="asahimetalindustrycovsuperiorcourt.html">Asahi</a></i
          >, which reasserts this threshold test. However, the Court also says
          if there�s lots of fair play, the minimum contacts required might be
          less.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How could we argue that there are <i>no</i> contacts in this case?
          What do we know about Rudzewicz? He never went to </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> at all. His Burger King franchise is in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>. His fries aren�t making it to </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>. He isn�t putting products into the stream of commerce in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Florida</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span>. He�s not licensed to do business in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>. He doesn�t pay any taxes in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>. His principle contacts were in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>So you can make a good argument for <i>no</i> contacts.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why would there be contacts? Rudzewicz and his partner signed a
          20-year franchise agreement with Burger King. Does the time period of
          the contract matter? Yes. It�s not an isolated, one-time transaction.
          There shall be repeated contacts over a 20-year period. It�s
          foreseeable that conflicts may arise between the parties and that a
          lawsuit may be brought in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. What else creates contacts between the franchisees and Burger King?
          <span class="SpellE">Rudzewicz�s</span> partner actually did go down
          to Burger King U. in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. He didn�t do that as an individual, but in his capacity as a
          partner in the franchise. The partners also bought equipment from
          Burger King in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What else? <i>World-Wide</i> talked about �networks� of businesses
          where there is a free flow of information, products, and services.
          Does this franchise model work the same way? A franchise works more
          independently from its franchisor than a Volkswagen dealer with
          respect to the manufacturer and distributor.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The contract itself says that it will be construed in accordance with
          the laws of the state of </span
        ><st1:State

          ></st1:State
        ><span
          >. What about purposeful <span class="SpellE">availment</span>?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are other things besides personal jurisdiction that courts
          decide before a trial, or in other words, before judging the case on
          its merits. The court looks at choice of law and venue in addition to
          jurisdiction. Usually, none of these is much of a challenge, but there
          will, of course, be some hard cases.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In a dispute, you can mutually choose what laws will govern the
          dispute, as long as there is some connection between the laws chosen
          and the parties.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There may also be a forum selection clause in a contract, where the
          parties agree ahead of time where suit will be brought in case there
          are any disputes.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>It turns out in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Michigan</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span> forum selection clauses are illegal.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So, were there minimum contacts? They had a long contract with Burger
          King. They negotiated with Burger King in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State

          decide such a case? <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>Stream of

      <p>
        <span
          >How do we distinguish <i>Burger King</i> from the other cases we�ve
          looked at lately? It is the fact that getting sued in </span

          partner travel there. Is there a difference between the two

          into foreign courts, and less willing to hale individuals.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court describes Rudzewicz as a sophisticated businessman, though
          this level of sophistication is unimportant. The important thing is
          that he didn�t negotiate the contract with Burger King himself, but
          rather he had legal counsel who negotiated his contract for him.</span

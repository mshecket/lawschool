<p><span>Yesterday,
we <i>blazed</i> through Rule 12. But
let’s go over Rule 12 more because there will almost certainly be a question on
Rule 12 on the exam.</span></p>

<p><span>All
12(b) motions are potential pre-trial motions to dismiss a case without it
having to go to trial.</span></p>

dir=LTR><span>But we protect
a 12(b)(6), failure to state a claim, as well as Rule 19, which can be raised
all the way up to the time of trial.</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>3.<span

dir=LTR><span>But subject
matter jurisdiction can be raised at <i>any time</i>, even by the court itself
without any action from the parties.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Hypotheticals
on Rule 12</span></b></p>

<p><span>Yeazell,
p. 93-94</span></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>Say
you file a 12(b)(6) motion and it’s denied. What if you then try a 12(b)(2)? Well, the court will say you’ve already waived this motion according to
Rule 12(g). 12(h) lists the motions that
are waived.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>At
some point, the court wants to go ahead and go forward with a matter even
though there may be problems with certain issues like personal jurisdiction. Why would the court do this? This is the equity/efficiency tradeoff. For efficiency reasons, if you wait too long,
we’re just going to say you’ve waived your right to have your motion heard.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
about if we file a Rule 12(f) motion to strike an allegation? Say it’s denied. Then we try filing a 12(b)(2). It will be waived too, based on Rule 12(g). If a party makes a motion under Rule 12 (in
general), but omit any other objection you can make, you can’t make that motion
later (with the 12(h) exceptions). 12(h)
doesn’t say there’s an exception for 12(f).<br style='mso-special-character:

<![endif]></span></p>

<p><i><span>If
you wrote on an exam that this claim would be waived according to Rule 12(h), you
would be wrong. It gets waived under
Rule 12(g)</span></i><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
you file a motion to transfer venue under 28 U.S.C. §1404 and you lose. Then you want to file a 12(b)(2) motion. <i>Nobody knows what would happen!</i></span></p>

<p><i><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></p>

<p><span>Rule
12(g) says if you make a motion under <i>Rule 12</i>, you give up the chance to
do 12(b)(2). But if we presume you didn’t
make a Rule 12 motion, you can still do your Rule 12 motions. It depends on whether you think the motion
was <i>under</i> Rule 12(b)(3). Tricky
tricky!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Different
courts in different jurisdictions have reached different results. This is a place where a litigator can argue
the procedural merits. It’s not a slam
dunk either way.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Question:
Are the FRCP statutory, or what? What
are their standing compared to, for example, 28 U.S.C. §1404?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="internationalshoecovwashington.html">International Shoe Co. v. Washington</a></span></i></b><b><span></span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>American
society changes after <i><a href="pennoyervneff.html">Pennoyer</a></i>. We have more corporations, more cars, and
more communications.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
going on at the time of the facts of <i>Shoe</i>? It’s around 1937-1940. It’s near the end of the Great Depression. There’s massive unemployment. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>’s response is creating a
state unemployment compensation system. They’re
going to have all of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>’s employers contribute to
this fund. This is sort of a state New
Deal program. At the time, this right
was subject to challenge.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
the problem, factually, that creates this case? Shoe is incorporated in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and lives in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, but they also employ traveling
salesmen in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. They’re selling shoes door-to-door.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Shoe
doesn’t pay the tax because they say they’re not a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> employer under the
act. That’s one argument they make. That’s not what the Supreme Court cares
about, that’s a matter of state law.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
second question is: how does the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> obtain personal
jurisdiction over Shoe? </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> personally serves one of
the salesmen within the state with notice and also mailed the notice to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
no question about notice in this case. Shoe knows they’ve been sued.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
does Shoe do procedurally? They make a
special appearance in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> at the <i>office of
unemployment</i> to argue that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> doesn’t have personal
jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
initial action takes place at the <i>administrative level</i>. We call that a <i>special appearance to quash</i><a

service.</i></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Surprise,
surprise! The administrative authority
says no dice. Give us the money. They find in favor of the state.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Shoe
appeals to the Superior Court of Washington (the district court). In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the state trial court reviews
the administrative authority as if the trial court were actually an appeals
court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
state trial court affirms the judgment of the administrative authority. So Shoe has lost twice now. But they don’t pay, they appeal again!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
then goes to the Washington Supreme Court, which also affirms the decision. But Shoe doesn’t pay, they appeal yet again
to the United States Supreme Court!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Supreme Court finally affirms for good.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
in the world was Shoe willing to litigate this issue all the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court? They seem very motivated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
bottom line is that we find that the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> <i>does</i> have jurisdiction
for the purposes of this tax over International Shoe.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
would Justice Field have said? He said a
state could require a corporation to appoint an agent for service of process.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Did
the company have property in the state? The office is in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The contracts are written up in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The stock in the corporation is mostly or
completely outside the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
in the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>? We have the salesmen and they have their shoe
samples (one shoe of a pair). <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We also
have the money that Shoe sends to pay their salesmen. Can the salesmen sell any goods in the state
of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>? No
way! The salesman can only take orders.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>Shoe</span></i><span> <i>has done everything
humanly possible to keep from being under the jurisdiction of the state of </i></span><st1:State><st1:place><i><span
  >Washington</span></i></st1:place></st1:State><i><span>.</span></i><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Could
we attach the shoes? Could we attach the
permanent sample rooms that they’ve rented?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>They
try to do personal service on the corporation by serving the salesman. However, they’re unwilling to make the
argument that they’re going to attach the one shoe or the display case. The state argues that the company is doing a “substantial
amount of business” in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and the Supreme Court buys
into this.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

<br/>

<p><span>What
is the modern test? Just look at the
sentence written by Stone. But what is “fair
play”? What is “substantial justice”? How many prongs does this test have? We’re going to see numerous future decisions
that try to interpret this decision. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Not
all of the implications of this decision are sorted out, even today.</span></p>

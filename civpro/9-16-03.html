          where the federal court is located also have personal jurisdiction
          over that defendant. In other words, the federal court�s
          jurisdictional reach is equal to that of a trial court (a court of
          <i>general jurisdiction</i>) in that state. So, for example, the </span

          interest in �the pot�. They have an obligation, but they don�t know
          who they�re obligated to. This is something that insurance companies
          do frequently. They know they have to pay out some money, but they
          don�t know who they have to pay it to. They more or less give the
          court some money and let them sort it out.</span

          show you stuff. There�s no personal jurisdiction if a site is passive.
          There is personal jurisdiction if the site is active. However, in
          reality, everything is intermediate and you must do a factual analysis
          as to the level of interactivity of the site and the jurisdictional
          consequences that follow.</span

          is tantamount to a lack of �purposeful availment�; you don�t �seek to

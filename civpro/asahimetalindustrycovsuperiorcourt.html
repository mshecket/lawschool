<p><span>Yeazell,
p. 129-135</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> A man got into a motorcycle
accident and sued Cheng Shin for product liability. Cheng Shin filed a third-party complaint in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> against Asahi, which made
parts for Cheng Shin.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Procedural
Posture:</span></b><span> Asahi
moved to quash Cheng Shin’s summons, saying </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> didn’t have jurisdiction. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The California Superior Court denied the
motion, and Asahi appealed to the California Supreme Court, which also denied
the motion. Asahi appealed up to the United
States Supreme Court.</span></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Does Asahi have minimum
contacts with </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> such that the exercise of personal
jurisdiction would not offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantive
justice”?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> The majority agrees with
the five factor test for “fair play”: (1) burden on the defendant, (2)
interests of the forum state, (3) interest of the plaintiff, (4) interstate
efficiency, and (5) interstate policy interests.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The Court finds that fair
play would be violated because:</span></p>

been a </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> manufacturer, the “fair
play” analysis would have been different. The burden on a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> manufacturer would be much
lower than a Japanese manufacturer. However, the plaintiff would still be a foreign corporation and the
interests of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> would still be
limited. If the plaintiff really wanted
to litigate in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

Asahi as a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

international conundrum, although the plaintiff would still be
international. All five factors are
taken into account together, and if the change in circumstances had warranted a
finding of “fair play” from the majority, then I think </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

<p><span>Civil
Procedure Class Notes </span><st1:date Year="2003" Day="18" Month="11"><span

<br/>

<p><span>We
have very few days left! We have this
week, <span class=GramE>then</span> we don’t meet at all next week. Then the first week of December is
weird. We’ll meet four times, but not
the normal days. Then we meet two more
times the next week.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Yesterday,
we did a lot. We did an introduction to
pleading and the basic standard of notice pleading and the exception of heightened
pleading. Rule 11 requires you to do
more than Rule 8 requires you to do in your complaint, which may lead to
conflicts. Having examined the complaint
stage, we blasted through the <span class=SpellE>preanswer</span>/answer
stage. This was review because we had
already looked at the 12(b) motions. If
you don’t do a <span class=SpellE>preanswer</span> motion, then you have to
answer. Your answer includes denials,
affirmative defenses, and counterclaims.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>As
to denials, Rule 8(b) says that you have to make denials line-by-line and
paragraph-by-paragraph.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>As
to affirmative defenses, statute of limitations is the most frequent one we’ve
encountered, but there are plenty of other ones.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Now
we’re going to do joinder of parties.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Joinder</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span><a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19</a> tells us
that some people <i>have to</i> join.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span><a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule20.htm">Rule 20</a> tells us
that joinder is permissible in that any plaintiff can join if they assert any
right to relief arising from the same claim.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Defendants
may be joined under basically the same standard. It’s basically reciprocal. This reflects a liberal idea of getting as
many people into the lawsuit as needed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>A
hypothetical</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Herman
is the driver and Wilma is a passenger. Their
car collides with a car driven by Dillon and owned by Owens.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Can
Herman and Wilma join under Rule 20 to sue Dillon? Sure! What is the basis for their joinder? It’s the same accident! If Dillon
is at fault for this accident, then whatever claim Wilma has, Herman has too.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if Herman wanted to sue Dillon the driver and Owens the owner? Can both of those parties be joined under <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule20.htm">Rule 20</a> as defendants? You can as long as the defendants arise out
of the same transaction or occurrence. Why would we want to have all these parties in the same lawsuit? It’s much more efficient to have everybody
lodge their crossing allegations in one forum and get it all resolved at once
if you can.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about Herman suing Dillon and General Motors? Will that be allowed? Sure, it’s
allowed under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule20.htm">Rule
20(a)</a>. The claims will be decidedly
different between Dillon and General Motors.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
Herman goes to try to settle the claim with Dillon and Sidney, Dillon’s son,
punches Herman. Can Herman join </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Sidney</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> for hitting him? <span class=GramE>Probably not.</span> <span class=GramE>But why?</span> This isn’t what the drafters wrote when they
wrote “series of transactions”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
rules are liberal, but there is an outer boundary beyond which you can’t join
up parties.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span><a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule20.htm">Rule 20</a> is not very
interesting. It’s usually easy to see
the relationship between the transactions or occurrences.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span><a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19</a> is where
the action is!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="templevsynthescorp.htm"><span class=GramE>Temple v. Synthes Corp.</span></a></span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
happening? </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Temple</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> had an operation in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to fix his back. After the operation, the screws break off in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Temple</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s back. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Temple</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> is from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Temple</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> files two separate
lawsuits. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Temple</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> files against Synthes, the
screw-making company from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> in federal court in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> based on diversity
jurisdiction. How do we get personal
jurisdiction over Synthes in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>? You can do any sort of minimum contacts
analysis. It wouldn’t be terribly
hard. You can probably get jurisdiction
in any state where their product is used and implanted.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Temple</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> files a state administrative
proceeding against the hospital and the doctor in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Then she files a lawsuit in state court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the federal action, Synthes files a motion to dismiss under 12(b<span
class=GramE>)(</span>7), saying that the plaintiff failed to join an
indispensable party under Rule 19.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
is no question that the plaintiff could have joined the hospital and the doctor
in a single action under <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule20.htm">Rule 20</a>. This is like the car accident where multiple
people may have been at fault. The question
is, if </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Temple</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> could have brought them in under <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule20.htm">Rule 20</a>, does she <i>have
to</i> bring them in under <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19</a>?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Who
brought the motion under <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19</a>? Synthes, the defendant, did. <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19</a> is brought
by defendants and it says: “We want more people in the suit!”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span><a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19</a> is couched
in terms of what may happen to a defendant. The court says that if you fall into this category, <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19(b)</a>
applies. The court determines whether
the action should proceed or be dismissed, concluding that the party is
indispensable. This is saying that there
are people whose rights will be affected by the litigation. If you can join them, you must. If you can’t, the court must decide whether
the litigation should proceed or should be dismissed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a way for defendants to get out of a lawsuit.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court doesn’t get to do this without guidance. There are various factors to consider as listed in <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19(b)</a>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court evaluates these factors in their decision.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a “per <span class=SpellE>curiam</span>” decision. This means either that a clerk wrote it and
it was really simple, or else it’s so controversial that they don’t want to put
specific names on it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
is <span class=GramE>this such</span> an easy case? The plaintiffs have autonomy as to who they
want to join. They shouldn’t have to sue
everybody if they don’t want to. Yet the
lower court makes the argument that they were an indispensable party under <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19(b)</a>. The Court says that there is no need to make
an inquiry under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule
19(b)</a>, because you have to do <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19(a)</a>
first. The Court finds that the doctor
and hospital don’t pass the <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19(a)</a> test as indispensable
parties.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
aren’t the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule
19(a)</a> standards met by this scenario?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
is <span class=SpellE>Synthes’s</span> defense in their first lawsuit? They will argue that it wasn’t their fault,
but rather the doctor or hospital’s fault. They will say that the screws are fine, but that it was the doctor’s
fault. The doctor’s claim will be that
they installed the device fine but that the device was badly made.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Synthes
tries to argue that they are being made subject to multiple obligations. Why is that not persuasive? Is Synthes really subject to multiple
obligations? Is it inconsistent to find
two different parties at fault for the same injury? No! They could be joint tortfeasors!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=GramE><i><span>“Synthes!</span></i></span><i><span> <span class=GramE>The screw maker!”</span></span></i><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court is right, but they took an easy way out. They point to the Advisory Committee notes that follow <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19</a> that
explicitly say that joint tortfeasors are merely permissive parties.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>Multiple
tortfeasors equals permissive joinder. </span></i><span>This is a black-letter rule.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
does it mean to have a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>real</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> indispensable party? Say you have a husband and wife who own a
piece of property and a potential buyer. They contract to sell the piece of property, and then the sellers repudiate
the deal. The buyer sues just the
husband for specific performance.</span></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Is the wife a <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule19.htm">Rule 19</a> party? In the absence of the wife, can we give
complete relief to the plaintiff? Can
the court force the husband to sell land that he only </span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>jointly</span></i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> owns with his wife? No! If
you jointly own something (unless it’s divisible), then both parties will have
to be joined.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Who
is going to bring this up? The defendant
will! The thing is that there will often
be a jurisdictional problem that will prevent the court from having jurisdiction
over the wife.</span></p>

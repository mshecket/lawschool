<p><b><i><span><a
href="gibbonsvbrown.htm">Gibbons v. Brown</a></span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It’s
another car accident! What
happened? Gibbons and the Browns were
driving in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Montreal</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. Gibbons gave Mr. Brown some bad directions
that caused him to turn the wrong way on a one-way street. They got into an accident.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
the accident was in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Canada</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, the Browns live in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and Gibbons lives in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Gibbons
sued for her injuries in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> (the Browns’ home state) in
state court, even though she could have filed in federal court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
first lawsuit is <i>Gibbons v. Clarence Brown</i>. Two years later, also in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> state court, Mrs. Brown
sues Gibbons: <i>Donna Brown v. Gibbons</i>. How is this possible that we could have a second lawsuit about the same
events filed years later? Mrs. Brown
sues under a different interpretation of the events.<a style='mso-footnote-id:

<br/>

<p><span>What
is the issue of this case? Is it a jurisdictional
issue? The question is whether the “long-arm”
statute in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> gives the state jurisdiction
over Gibbons for the purposes of the suit.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>“<i>This
case is irrelevant to the scheme of jurisprudence in this country.</i>” It’s a “<span class=SpellE>piddley</span>
little case out of an intermediate court in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>“Long-arm”
statutes</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>These
statutes establish a subset of the scope of personal jurisdiction that the Constitution
allows. If a state chooses, they can
make their authority coextensive with the Due Process Clause: “The long-arm statute
of the state of X is coextensive with the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the long-arm statute has a
somewhat smaller scope than it could under the Constitution. This will generally mean that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> will get fewer cases.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
first question you should ask when you are dealing with issues of personal
jurisdiction is: Does it satisfy the long-arm statute? If the answer is “no”, then you’re done. If the answer is “yes”, then you move to Due
Process. Courts will avoid ruling on constitutional
questions when it can.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So,
the long-arm statute offers a <i>threshold test</i>. You always look at it first, because it is <i>no
wider</i> <i>than</i> the constitutional limit of the state’s authority.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Isn’t
it possible that a state could have an unconstitutional long-arm statute?<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[2]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
a long-arm statute partially busts out of Due Process, you may need to go to
the next level to make sure that the statute itself is constitutional.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> long-arm statute says is that a defendant must be “engaged
in substantial and not isolated activity” within </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> in order for </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to have jurisdiction. This sounds like a version of “continuous and
systematic”, the federal standard for general jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>Is
the first lawsuit by Gibbons “substantial and not isolated”</span></i><span>? What if the first case wasn’t over? How would that affect our answer to this
question? Uh…what was the answer to this
question?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court keys in on the temporal aspect of <span class=SpellE>Gibbons’s</span>
activities. Is Gibbons <i>engaged</i> in
an activity? The court <i>assumes</i>
that the case is over. Based on this,
they say Gibbons is <i>not</i> <i>currently </i>engaged in any activities in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
a practical aspect to this. If Gibbons
is subject to personal jurisdiction in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, she can be sued there for
anything that happens anywhere at any time.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Compare
this situation to <i>Adam v. <span class=SpellE>Saenger</span></i>. <span class=SpellE>Saenger</span> went to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to sue, but then Adam
countersued and won as <span class=SpellE>Saenger</span> defaulted. When Adam went to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to enforce the judgment, <span
class=SpellE>Saenger</span> argued that the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> court had no jurisdiction. The Supreme Court found that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> had jurisdiction because <span
class=SpellE>Saenger</span> had gone to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to sue Adam.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Most
states have gone the way of <i><a href="helicopertosvhall.html"><span
class=SpellE>Helicopteros</span></a></i> and the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> long-arm statute, which
goes as far as the Due Process Clause permits, as interpreted by the
courts. On the other hand, in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the long-arm statute says
exactly what it means to say: that it’s exactly coextensive with the Constitution.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
say we’ve cleared the long-arm statute. How
do we come out in <i>Gibbons</i> under Due Process? There’s no way you’d get general jurisdiction. Compare to <i>Perkins</i> and <i>Rosenberg</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about specific jurisdiction? Can we get
Gibbons there? Gibbons availed herself
of the courts. This is a closer
case. Brennan would say there are minimum
contacts (c.f. <i><a href="burnhamvsuperiorcourt.html">Burnham</a></i>). <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Other justices might say that there is
fairness, too.</span></p>

aside: could Mrs. Brown have been somehow joined in the first lawsuit? Someone would have to try to bring her
in. Gibbons didn’t want to bring her
in. Mr. Brown could bring her in, but
then again, she is his wife. Donna
herself might not have been able to join the suit on her own in <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>. In federal court, however, she might have
been able to get herself joined.</p>

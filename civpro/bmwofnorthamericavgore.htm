        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          BMW sold Gore a car that had been repainted due to acid rain damage.
          Gore found out and sued and won compensatory damages of $4,000 and
          punitive damages of $4,000,000 based on the theory that there were
          about 1,000 other people who bought similarly repainted cars. The
          Alabama Supreme Court reduced the punitive damages award to
          $2,000,000. BMW appealed to the United States Supreme Court.</span

        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Court finds that BMW�s conduct was not that reprehensible, and in
          fact is permissible in many other states. The Court especially notes
          that BMW�s conduct did not threaten anyone�s health or safety.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court finds that a punitive damages award that is 500 times the
          compensatory damages award is too high, though the Court declines to
          draw a line saying what �multiplier� is constitutionally
          acceptable.</span

        <span
          >Finally, the Court notes that by statute, the maximum penalty for
          violation of </span

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span> A class action was filed against </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          on behalf of handicapped children. The class was represented by Idaho
          Legal Aid. The state offered a settlement which included a waiver by
          the class of any claim to attorney�s fees. The attorney for the class
          felt that he should accept because the settlement would give them a
          better deal than they could have gotten at trial. However, Idaho Legal
          Aid didn�t want the attorney to accept the offer, because it meant
          that the organization wouldn�t get any money. The class argued that
          the offer including the fee waiver was coercive and shouldn�t be
          upheld by the court. The district court, however, approved the
          settlement and denied attorney�s fees and costs.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Procedural Posture: </span></b
        ><span
          >The Court of Appeals reversed the district court�s ruling, saying
          that �a stipulated waiver of all attorney's fees obtained solely as a
          condition for obtaining relief for the class should not be accepted by
          the court.� The state of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> appealed to the Supreme Court.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Do federal district courts have the power to approve the waiver of
          attorney�s fees?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Rule 23(e) requires court approval of settlements of class actions.
          The Fees Act doesn�t prohibit all settlements conditioned on the
          waiver of fees.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Court finds that the district court did not go over the line in
          approving the fee waiver in the context of a settlement favorable to
          the plaintiffs.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and reinstated the
          ruling of the trial court that the attorney�s fees could be
          waived.</span

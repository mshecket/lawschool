          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State

      <p>
        <span>The tough one is BrakeCo. Does </span

        ><span>
          have jurisdiction? Do they put products into the stream of commerce?
          Sure. Is it foreseeable that their brakes would end up in cars in </span

          BrakeCo is from </span

        ><span>, while Asahi is from </span

          ><st1:place><span>Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region
        ><span
          >. We can�t answer this question definitively. Under stream of
          commerce, minimum contacts are established. Under stream of commerce
          plus, then we need to look at the four factors, e.g. did the brake
          company advertise in </span

            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Florida</span></st1:place

      <p>
        <span>So everyone is subject to personal jurisdiction in </span

          took us into a different constitutional issue that is closely related
          to, though not identical to, personal jurisdiction: <i>notice</i>. The
          result in
          <i><a href="mullanevcentralhanoverbanktrustco.html">Mullane</a> </i>is
          that the lawsuit gets dismissed not because the forum didn�t have
          jurisdiction over the defendants, but rather because the defendants
          were not given adequate notice.</span

          There is an appendix of forms attached to the Federal Rules so that
          you don�t have to make up your own forms. What�s in the form just
          comes right out of what the rule itself says.</span

          Rule 3 says that �A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint
          with the court.� Strangely enough, this doesn�t necessarily help you

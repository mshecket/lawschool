<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Honda sold an ATV that
injured Oberg. Oberg sued and was
awarded $1 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages
by the jury. Honda appealed on the basis
that the punitive damage award violated the Fourteenth Amendment since </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> courts weren’t allowed to
review such awards.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Does the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> constitutional prohibition
on judicial review of jury punitive damages awards violate the Fourteenth
Amendment?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> Procedural laws and rules
that undermine common law procedural protections are presumed to violate the Due
Process Clause.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The Court argues that common
law procedural safeguards form a foundation on which modern constitutional Due
Process is built. That means that
whatever procedural protections existed at common law must at least be
maintained. In fact, most of the Court’s
decisions have built up new protections unknown at common law but required by
the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court
finds that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, in effect, “dug under” the
foundation and abridged a protection that existed even before the Constitution.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Ginsburg
and the Chief argue that the protections afforded to litigants at trial and
upon appeal in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> are sufficient to satisfy constitutional
Due Process.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The judgment is reversed
and remanded to reconsider the punitive damage award.</span></p>

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The federal government unlawfully sold the plaintiffs� livestock to a
          glue factory. The plaintiff was awarded damages of almost $200,000 by
          the federal district court and the </span

          ><st1:place><span>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region
        ><span> appeals.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> Was the damage award appropriately calculated?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          �The fundamental principle of damages is to restore the injured party,
          as nearly as possible, to the position he would have been in had it
          not been for the wrong of the other party.�</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that the trial judge incorrectly assigned the value of
          the horses and burros based on their particular value to the
          plaintiffs rather than based on their general market value. The lower
          court should have used some type of market measure of damages.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court also finds that the calculation of loss of use damages was
          arbitrary, should have been based on the actual proximate harm done by
          the federal government, and should be mitigated based on the
          plaintiffs ability to acquire suitable replacements for the animals
          lost.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Finally, the court objects to the fact that the trial judge awarded
          each plaintiff the same amount for pain and suffering. The court finds
          this incorrect on its face because individuals must be awarded such
          damages on an individual basis.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Basically, the court wants the damages to be calculated in more
          detail.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The case was reversed and remanded for a new trial as to damages. The
          trial judge was advised to recuse himself from the case.</span

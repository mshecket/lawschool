          husband was driving it. They hit a pothole and the plaintiff fell off
          and got hurt and the bike was damaged. We have injuries to the
          plaintiff and damage to the motorcycle from hitting the pothole while

          brought up, but weren�t, while issue preclusion deals with things that

          seemed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">��� </span>The court uses res
          judicata as a synonym for claim preclusion. But the weird thing is
          that <i>personal injuries</i> and <i>property injuries</i> are taken
          to be two separate causes of action, subject to the limitation of
          issue preclusion (AKA collateral estoppel). Then it states the regular
          old issue preclusion.</span

          suffered by the same person? The law of <i>Vasu</i> was clear: you
          have two causes of action: one for your property and one for your
          personal injuries. What the lower court did was exactly correct based
          on the law as it was at the time.</span

          had been following an old view of the law, and the Supreme Court says
          that it�s not two causes of action, but rather a single cause of
          action with two types of damages. For purposes of procedure and
          preclusion, Rush should have put all her claims in one suit. Why would
          the court want you to do that? It�s more efficient and it�s cheaper.
          Notice that the city must defend itself twice in this case.</span

        <span
          >Is there another reason defendants might want to have all the cases
          together? What was at risk in the first lawsuit? Just the motorcycle.
          It was a small kind of damages. Does this suggest a different
          litigation strategy than you would use in a personal injury claim?
          Sure. You wouldn�t pay as much attention to a $100 claim than you
          would to a $12,000 claim. If you allow piecemeal claims, you send out
          bad incentives. If you put it all together, the defendant can better
          protect all its interests by having them litigated in one
          lawsuit.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The preclusion doctrine is justified by weighing our big factors of
          efficiency and equity. We avoid inefficient extra litigation, and we
          also avoid unfairness to defendants in making them defend too damn
          many lawsuits.</span

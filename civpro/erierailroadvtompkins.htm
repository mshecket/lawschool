        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Tompkins got his arm lopped off in a train accident. He sued the
          railroad in the Southern District of New York to try to take advantage
          of the rule of <i>Swift v. Tyson</i>, which said that federal court
          didnï¿½t have to use state common law to decide cases.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Procedural Posture: </span></b
        ><span
          >Tompkins won at trial and the railroad appealed to the Second
          Circuit, arguing that </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          law, which would have been more favorable to the defendant, should
          have been applied. The Second Circuit upheld the verdict for Tompkins,
          refusing to interpret </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          law. The Supreme Court granted certiorari because they wanted to
          strike down <i>Swift</i>.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b

          Can federal courts ignore state law when deciding diversity
          cases?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b

          NEW RULE!!! Federal courts must follow and apply both state statutes
          <i>and</i> state case law in deciding cases unless the case is
          governed by federal statutes or the United States Constitution.</span

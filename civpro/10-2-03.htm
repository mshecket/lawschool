<p><span>We
left off in <i><a href="piperaircraftvreyno.htm">Piper</a></i>. Everything about this airplane crash happened
in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> or </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. However, we have a lawsuit filed in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> against two American
manufacturers.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case started in state court, then was removed to federal court, transferred to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> federal court and then
ultimately dismissed on the ground of forum non conveniens.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
test for forum non conveniens is the <i>Gilbert</i> test. It’s pretty simple. You just need to know and apply the factors
to the facts of a given case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Choice-of-law</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
does choice of law apply? Well,
different law will apply to different defendants. This could make things complicated for an
American jury.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Rule of <i>Klaxon</i> says that a federal court ordinarily must apply the
choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
is exception to the rule for cases that are transferred. When a case gets transferred, you apply the
choice-of-law rules of the state <i>from which</i> it was transferred. (This is called the <i>Van <span
class=SpellE>Dursen</span> &amp; <span class=SpellE>Ferens</span></i>
doctrine.) The point is that a transfer
should be no more and no less than a “change of courthouse”, but it shouldn’t
change the law that is used.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the facts of <i><a href="piperaircraftvreyno.htm">Piper</a></i>, the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> district court should be
using </span><st1:State><st1:place><i><span>California</span></i></st1:place></st1:State><span> rules. The court finds that under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> rules, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law would likely govern the
dispute against Piper.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
a problem, however, with respect to <span class=SpellE>Hartzell</span>. What’s the matter? <span class=SpellE>Hartzell</span> was an </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> corporation that argued in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> federal court that the federal
court lacked personal jurisdiction over it. Before that issue was resolved, the case was transferred to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> has no jurisdiction over <span
class=SpellE>Hartzell</span>, it would be inappropriate to apply </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law because it has no power
over that defendant. So what does </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>’s district court do? We can’t use </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, so we’re going to use
our own!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
district court in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> applied </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> choice-of-law rules (which constitute
a significant contacts test). <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This results
in the decision that <i>Scottish</i> law shall apply to <span class=SpellE>Hartzell</span>. Now we have a mess. And this mess is just what the defendants
wanted! This was all a big, devious
plan!!!!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>MUHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA!!!! This problem will make the case very
unattractive to try in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Even
if personal jurisdiction, venue, notice and all that are good, a court can
still dismiss a case for forum non conveniens.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Transfer
of venue – <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1404.html">28 U.S.C.
§ 1404</a></span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>You
can only transfer a case to a district court that has personal jurisdiction and
venue. When Piper and <span
class=SpellE>Hartzell</span> ask to be transferred to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, they were conceding that
the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> court had personal jurisdiction and venue
over them.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
provision sort of “bootstraps” the venue statute: <a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1391.html">28 U.S.C. § 1391</a>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
test in § 1404 is whether the current court is:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span
dir=LTR><span>“In the
interest of justice”</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
sounds a little bit like the <i>Gilbert</i> test. This is sort of like an inter-court forum non
conveniens.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
do we haul everybody over to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> when everybody’s already in
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a <i>soft test</i> that allows the court a lot of discretion. In a practical sense, what will happen with
these litigants?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
do you argue if you’re Piper’s attorney? You can say that “everything is in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>”. Is there inconvenience to the plaintiffs? No, because they came all the way from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>! In fact, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> is closer than </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Notice
what’s happening here. The defense is
arguing to the judge in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> that everything is in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and then they argue to the
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> judge that everything is in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. They win both arguments!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
in the world didn’t they argue to go to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> from the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> court? If </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> used its choice-of-law
rules, both defendants might be subject to the same laws, and there wouldn’t be
a forum non conveniens problem.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Could
the state court in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> dismiss for forum non
conveniens straight to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Scotland</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Another
statute that was mentioned was <a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1406.html">28 U.S.C. § 1406</a>. Basically, this says that if you mess up and
file in the wrong venue, they can just transfer it over rather than dismiss the
claim.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Also,
under <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1631.html">28 U.S.C. §
1631</a>, you can transfer for want of jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>What
does <i>Piper</i> mean?</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>Everything
we have done in the course up to now can be <i>trumped</i> by a forum non
conveniens motion. You can say: I have
power, there is proper notice, <span class=GramE>Due</span> Process is
satisfied. However, I’m not going to try
this case. Courts have the power to do
this.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It’s
sort of like saying now that we’ve balanced <span class=GramE>everything,</span>
let’s balance again with an even mushier standard.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Remember
<i><a href="asahimetalindustrycovsuperiorcourt.html">Asahi</a>?</i></span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>This
gave us a splintered opinion that confuses us about whether to apply stream of
commerce or stream of commerce plus. <i><a
href="asahimetalindustrycovsuperiorcourt.html">Asahi</a> </i>is a bad personal
jurisdiction case, but it’s a good forum non conveniens case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case is “served up” to the Court as a personal jurisdiction case, but really it
should have been a forum non conveniens case. Independent of personal jurisdiction, there’s no <i>reason</i> this
should be happening here. Everything
important is in </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Asia</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It’s
time to turn a corner and say goodbye to our friends in personal jurisdiction. We’ve addressed the question: Does <i>any </i>court
in a state have power to hear a given case?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We’re
now going to take up a new question: <i>Which</i> court, state or federal, has
the power to hear this case?</span></p>

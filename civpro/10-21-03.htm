<p><b><span>More
on <i><a href="caterpillarincvlewis.htm">Caterpillar</a></i></span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
do enough wrongs make a right? This
started off as a regular old state case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Lewis
sued Caterpillar and Whayne. There was
no diversity at that point. However,
when Lewis settles with Whayne, that claim falls out of the picture, <i>but not</i>
Whayne as a <i>party</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>At
the last possible moment, Caterpillar removes to federal court, but it was <i>wrongful</i>
at the time. Lewis points this out, but
the federal court denies the motion to remand, and that was a mistake at the
time. BAD! BAD!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Subsequently,
Whayne is dismissed as a party. By the
time we get to trial, we have a perfectly decent and respectable federal
diversity case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>But
what’s our rule? </span></i><span>You must have jurisdiction
at the time the action is <i>initiated</i>. Allowing this case to go forward violates this fundamental rule.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Lewis
appeals to the Sixth Circuit, which reverses because they find there was no jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Supreme Court reverses, and Ginsburg says that it’s not worthwhile from a cost
standpoint to send the case back down after it’s already been, <i>in some sense</i>,<i>
</i>properly adjudicated insofar as jurisdiction became proper by the time of
trial.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Recall
<i><a href="louisvillenashvillerailroadvmottley.htm">Mottley</a></i>: how does
this go together with <i><a href="caterpillarincvlewis.htm">Caterpillar</a></i>? <i><a
href="louisvillenashvillerailroadvmottley.htm">Mottley</a> </i>was supremely
inefficient. The same issues were tried
and appealed through the federal court system and then again through the whole
state court system and right back up to the Supreme Court again!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
happened in the initial federal trial in <i><a
href="louisvillenashvillerailroadvmottley.htm">Mottley</a></i>? There was never a trial on the merits. On the other hand, <i><a
href="caterpillarincvlewis.htm">Caterpillar</a></i> had already gone to a trial
and a verdict.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about <i><a href="saadehvfarouki.htm">Saadeh</a></i>? This went to trial and the plaintiff
won. But the D.C. Circuit dismissed for
lack of jurisdiction <i>after</i> the trial! Why didn’t efficiency win out here like it apparently did in <i><a
href="caterpillarincvlewis.htm">Caterpillar</a></i>? Could there be a constitutional question
here? It might be unconstitutional if
the court in <i><a href="saadehvfarouki.htm">Saadeh</a></i> lets the case go
forward. Furthermore, there has <i>never</i>
been jurisdiction in federal court at <i>any </i>level for alien v. alien.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Also,
<i><a href="caterpillarincvlewis.htm">Caterpillar</a> </i>was <i>removed</i>,
rather than initiated in federal court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
it’s tough to distinguish <i><a href="saadehvfarouki.htm">Saadeh</a></i>. The Supreme Court has recently granted cert
in a case called <i>Atlas Global</i>. Atlas is suing Data Flux for breach of contract. Atlas sued in federal court based on
diversity. Atlas is a partnership, and
as was mentioned with <i><a href="unitedmineworkersvgibbs.htm">Gibbs</a></i>,
partnerships’ citizenships are determined by <i>all</i> of their members.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Atlas
had members from three places: </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >Mexico</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. <a href="http://www.dataflux.com.mx/">Dataflux</a>
is a Mexican corporation. What does §
1332(a) tell us? This case violates the
rule of complete diversity! But nobody
complained (at least at first).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
the plaintiffs did was boot the Mexican partner. Nobody complained. The case went to trial, and the plaintiff
won. <i>Then</i>, Dataflux filed to
dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Why can they make this motion that late? <i>It’s the most favored motion! You can raise it at any time!</i> <i>Even the court can raise the motion sua
sponte!</i> Why did Dataflux wait? Had Dataflux won, they wouldn’t have made
this motion. They’re trying to get “two
bites of the apple”. They want to either
win on the merits or get a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
wasn’t complete diversity at the time of <i>filing</i>, but there <i>was</i>
complete diversity at the time of trial.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is granted. The plaintiff appeals to the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit cites <i><a
href="caterpillarincvlewis.htm">Caterpillar</a></i>’s efficiency argument to
reverse the motion to dismiss.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
case like <i><a href="caterpillarincvlewis.htm">Caterpillar</a></i>, which
suggests that we can ignore an established rule of law for efficiency reasons,
can cause a lot of mischief. Fairman
guesses that the Supreme Court will limit the holding of <i><a
href="caterpillarincvlewis.htm">Caterpillar</a></i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>SLUSA
is a federal statute that (1) preempts state securities class actions, (2)
makes purely state law securities fraud cases removable, and (3) orders the
dismissal of the removed class actions.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Steve
Y. says that SLUSA uses removal as a tool <i>not just to move things around</i>,
but as a tool to restrict a substantive right. That’s not what we usually think of when we think of the uses of civil
procedure.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Are
we ready to move on and leave subject matter jurisdiction? Noooooo! Don’t make us do <i><a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i>!!!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Two
big questions:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span

in the state have power to hear the case? (Personal jurisdiction)</span></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span
dir=LTR><span>If so, which
court? (Subject matter jurisdiction)</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Federal
courts can hear federal questions, diversity cases, supplemental jurisdiction,
and removal cases.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Another
big question: <i>what law applies</i> in federal court?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
does a federal court do when it sits in diversity? What law does it apply?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The
</span></b><st1:City><st1:place><b><span>Erie</span></b></st1:place></st1:City><b><i><span> </span></i></b><b><span>Problem</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>It’s
all the Founding Fathers’ fault for creating the dual court system and allowing
federal courts to hear diversity cases based on state law. But <i>what</i> state law are the federal
court going to apply in such cases?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Erie</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> problem is a lot broader than <i><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i> the case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Fairman
says that <i>most of the time</i>, the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Erie</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> issue is <i>not difficult
at all</i>. We have a rule: when
Congress created the federal court and empowered them to hear diversity cases,
it had to tell them which law to use in those cases.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>That’s
where the Rules of Decision Act (RDA) comes in. It says that federal courts will use state law to decide diversity
cases. The RDA has survived virtually
unchanged to the present day: <a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1652.html">28 U.S.C. § 1652</a>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
what does the statue mean by “the laws of the several states”?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Yeazell
spared us from having to read <i>Swift v. Tyson</i> and its interpretation of
the phrase “the laws of the several states”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
modern times, almost everything is statutory and not a whole lot is common law. In the old days, there was a lot more common
law and a lot fewer statutes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you want to look up <i>the law</i>, we might look up statutes as well as case
law. <i>Swift</i> had to figure out what
law applied.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Justice
Story says that court decisions are not <i>laws</i>. Story said that “laws equal statutes”.<a

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court finds that state statutes will bind federal courts. But what if there are no statutes? How do we will the gap? The </span><st1:Street><st1:address><i><span
  >Swift</span></i><span
  > Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> decided that we could fill
in the gaps with <i>federal common law</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Story
says that the law is The Law, and is the same and unchangeable everywhere. This is an idea grounded in Natural Law philosophy. It’s hard for us to get our minds around this
philosophy of law.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>That
leads us to…</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie Railroad v. Tompkins</a></span></i></b><b><span></span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><i><span>What
are the facts?</span></i><span> Tompkins is going to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. What’s he doing? He’s walking along the railroad tracks. A train goes by and he gets hit by the train
and his arm gets severed. One-Arm
Tompkins is going to sue </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Erie</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. He’s MAD!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
suit is brought in the Southern District of New York against the railroad. The subject matter jurisdiction is
diversity. No problem with personal
jurisdiction because the plaintiff sues the railroad in its home state. But what law shall we apply? There’s a very specific legal issue they’re
trying to settle: will the Pennsylvania common law of negligence apply, or will
New York common law of negligence apply, or something else altogether?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
the issue is: what is level of duty owed by the railroad to the guy walking by
the railroad tracks? Different jurisdictions
have different ways of describing that duty.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law would describe Tompkins
as a trespasser who can only collect damages if the railroad showed “wanton negligence”.
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The “general federal common law” only
applied “ordinary negligence” and “reasonable care”…good for the plaintiff! The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> had some kind of law too,
but it seems that it won’t apply here.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>Why
does this matter? </span></i><span>This is all or nothing: the
choice of law will determine the outcome of the case. The greater the duty owed to Tompkins, the
greater the chance is that he will win.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
won’t </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law apply if Tompkins sues in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>? What law does he want applied? He wants <i>federal common law</i>. This all stems from the RDA: Tompkins sued
the railroad. The district court will
apply <i>Swift</i>. Since there is no statute,
federal common law is applied and Tompkins prevails.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
railroad appeals, and the Second Circuit affirms. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The Second Circuit says that <i>Swift</i>
applies because there is no statute, and thus federal common law is applied.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Then
it goes up to the Supreme Court, and they reverse. <i>How come?</i></span></p>

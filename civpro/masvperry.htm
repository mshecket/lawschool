<p><i><span>Mas
v. Perry</span></i></p>

<p><span>489
F.2d 1396 (5th Cir. 1974)</span></p>

<p><span>Yeazell,
pp. 229-232</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The plaintiffs are a French
man and a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> woman. They were married in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and then they moved to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to be grad students. While they were living in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the plaintiffs discovered
that Perry had been observing them through two-way mirrors in the apartment
they were renting from him. The plaintiffs
sued and won on the merits. During the
trial, the defendant objected to the court’s subject matter jurisdiction,
claiming there was no diversity between the parties. The plaintiffs won and the defendant appealed
to the 5<sup>th</sup> Circuit solely on jurisdictional grounds.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Does the federal court have
diversity jurisdiction over this matter?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> Complete diversity of the
parties is required in order for diversity jurisdiction to exist, meaning that
no party on one side may be a citizen of the same state as any party on the
other side.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court looks at Mr. and
Mrs. Mas in turn.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court finds that Mr. Mas was still a citizen of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >France</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> at the time of the filing
of the lawsuit because he had not become a naturalized American citizen.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court finds that Mrs. Mas was domiciled in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> at the time of the suit. Mrs. Mas lived in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> when she married Mr. Mas,
and her domicile did not change when they moved to Lousiana because there were
not going to be there indefinitely, but only as students.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court refuses to apply the general rule that a wife is domiciled where her
husband is domiciled to the case where an American woman marries a foreign
man. The court cites a statute, <a
href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1489.html">8 U.S.C. § 1489</a>,
which says that an American woman does not lose her citizenship if she marries
a foreign man.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The court affirmed the trial
court’s ruling.</span></p>

grad student the whole time she was in </span></span><st1:State><st1:place><span

a domicile <i>merely</i> by being a student. By the time of the present case and <i>Gordon</i>, this was changing. <i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></i>In <i>Gordon</i>, the court based its
opinion on more than just the plaintiff’s attending school. The thing that really swayed that court was
the fact that Gordon stated that she <i>intended to remain </i>in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. So if Mrs. Mas doesn’t <i>intend to remain</i>
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, her domicile is sort of in limbo, but it remains

controversies with two <i>different</i> grounds for diversity jurisdiction. I don’t know what the heck he’s saying.</span></span></p>

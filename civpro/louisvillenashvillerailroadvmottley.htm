        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The facts are actually irrelevant, but the
          <span class="SpellE">Mottleys</span> got a lifetime free rail pass to
          settle a claim against the railroad. Later, Congress outlawed all
          lifetime rail passes and the railroad refused to honors the
          <span class="SpellE">Mottleys</span>� pass anymore. The
          <span class="SpellE">Mottleys</span> sued <i>in federal court </i>for
          specific performance to keep their pass. They basically anticipated
          that the defense of the railroad would be to say that Congress forbade
          them from honoring the pass but that such an interpretation of the
          statute violated the Fifth Amendment, and that�s why the
          <span class="SpellE">Mottleys</span> brought suit in federal court.
          The federal court granted specific performance to the
          <span class="SpellE">Mottleys</span> and the railroad appealed to the
          Supreme Court.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the federal district court have subject matter jurisdiction over
          the case? (This is the <i>real</i> issue, though it wasn�t one of the
          issues argued before the court.)</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span> A suit arises under the Constitution and laws of the </span
        ><st1:country-region
          ><st1:place><span>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region
        ><span>
          only if the original statement of the plaintiff�s cause of action
          <i>shows</i> that it is based on the Constitution or federal statutes.
          (A federal court can�t have jurisdiction just because the
          <i>defendant</i> might use a federal law or the Constitution to defend
          himself.)</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court cites two cases,
          <i>Tennessee v. Union &amp; Planters� Bank</i> and
          <i
            >Boston &amp; Montana Consolidated Copper &amp; Silver Mining
            Company v. Montana Ore Purchasing Company</i
          >. These cases set up the rule stated above. The basic reason for this
          rule is that it is unnecessary for a plaintiff to answer their own
          complaint.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The case is reversed and remanded to the federal district court which
          is directed to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter
          jurisdiction.</span

            But there are also disadvantages. First, you might actually want

            >In <i>Smith</i>, the claim is stated under state law, but you can�t
            explain just what the defendant did wrong without resorting to the
            contention that a certain federal law is unconstitutional. It almost
            seems to me like if the defendant could get you for �failure to
            state a claim� if you don�t refer to any federal law, then you have
            a �federal question�. <i>Mottley</i> is distinguishable in that you
            can state a claim (�They broke a contract!�) without saying anything
            about federal law. In <i>Smith</i>, let�s say you just said: �They
            bought some bonds!� Then the defendant would say, �So what? No
            claim.� Or, what if you said: �They bought some
            <i>illegal</i> bonds!� They would say, �<span class="SpellE"
              >Whaddya</span
            >
            mean illegal?� And you could either say: �Oh�.nothing�� or you could
            say �Illegal because FEDERAL <span class="SpellE">FEDERAL</span>
            <span class="SpellE">FEDERAL</span>!� And then you�re in,
            baby!</span

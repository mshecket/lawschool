of hypothetical (i) from yesterday, and in particular issue preclusion</span></p>

<p><span>Why
<i>Pennoyer</i>? It introduces three
basic concepts that are still important today:</span></p>

jurisdiction is power, and the power of states or other jurisdictions (federal
courts) to make you do what you might otherwise not do; plus limits to that
power imposed by the Constitution itself</span></span></p>

window. For example, in corporate law,

modern view.</span></span></p>

“concealed” strand of <i>Pennoyer</i>. This will eventually become a constitutional requirement. At the time of <i>Pennoyer</i>, we have sort
of a duality of notice. For <i>in
personam</i> jurisdiction, you need personal service of process within the state. For <i>in rem</i> or <i>quasi in rem</i>
actions, you can be served by publication. With publication service, do we know that the defendant received <i>actual</i>
notice? Nope. At the time of <i>Pennoyer</i>, notice is
important, but we have two different ways of achieving it, and one is more or
less fictional. Over time, courts will
become uncomfortable with this fiction.</span></span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Harris
v. Balk</span></i></b><b><span></span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Balk has lent money to
Harris, and Epstein has lent money to Balk. Harris and Balk are in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >North Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and Epstein is in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Epstein owes Balk, Balk owes Harris. So we figure, let’s have Harris pay Epstein,
because then everybody would get repaid. Everybody could be made whole.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Epstein
sues in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to get Harris to pay him. Then Balk sues Harris in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >North Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Harris’s defense is that he’s already paid
his debt to Epstein, such that Balk should get his money back from Epstein.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:
</span></b><span>What must
the jurisdictional issues be? </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >North Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the Supreme Court rules,
must enforce the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> judgment, because personal
jurisdiction was obtained over Balk when Harris entered </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Conceptually,
we’re trying to figure out if debts are a personal obligation or <i>in rem</i>
obligations. The Court says that the
debt travels with the debtor, making the [creditor] subject to personal
jurisdiction wherever the debtor goes. If one is a creditor, <i>that sucks</i>. If you lend people money, and then you’re subject to personal
jurisdiction wherever that person goes, you might get sued anywhere that debtor
goes. I, the creditor, am in big
trouble!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case is made possible by the difference between <i>in rem</i> and <i>in
personam</i> jurisdiction, and the rise of non-tangible kinds of property. How do we classify such property? This is the first case that illustrates this
problem.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span>Hess
v. Pawloski</span></i></b><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Someone
from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> is heading up to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, where they have a car
wreck. It happens all the time today,
but in 1927, it was a constitutional crisis. An out-of-state defendant gets into an accident. In order for the person who got hit in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to sue, they must serve the
person that hit them personally in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. This can’t be the law, especially as our
society gets more and more mobile.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So,
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> passes a statute that says that when you
drive on </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> roads, you implicitly consent to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>All
of this was created as a result of the need to make the <i>Pennoyer</i> rules
fit contemporary society.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Over
time, we get more and more exceptions to the rigid <i>in personam</i>/<i>in rem</i>
system of Justice Field.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>Harris</span></i><span> is wrong, <i>Hess</i> is
right, based on how we do things today.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis
of Rule 12</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
a lawsuit is filed, you can file a motion to dismiss, or do nothing and execute
a collateral attack. Let’s see how that
goes on the federal level.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Rule
12 is a long rule. It deals with when
you can move to dismiss due to lack of personal jurisdiction, among other
things.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Rule
12 is tough! You have to wade through
them. This is an important rule, and if
you practice in the federal courts you will definitely use this rule.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>(a)
First off, there is an answer deadline. When do you have to answer a complaint? 20 days after you’ve been served. That’s not a lot of time. Your
client has been served. Then they go around
looking for a lawyer, and you might have far less than 20 days to do your
answer. But you have another option: if
you waive service under Rule 4(d), you get 60 days after the request of the
waiver. As a practical matter, most
people waive service because that’s a big boon. These are rules for repeat players in the litigation game.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
12(a) just tells us <i>when</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>(b)
There’s a lot of stuff you can present, stuff you can include in your answer.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
you file an action against somebody, that’s a <i>claim</i>. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>What if that person wants to sue you
back? That’s the <i>counterclaim</i>.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span

mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[2]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if I want to sue against two different people? I can have a claim against them, they can have a claim against me, but
they might have claims against <i>each other</i>. These are <i>cross-claims</i>. In other words, these are claims between
people on the same side of the “v.”: plaintiff v. plaintiff, or defendant v.
defendant.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
say the defendant wants to bring in their insurance company. This would be a third-party claim.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>All
Rule 12(b) says is: <i>bring it on!</i> Let’s get everybody in and on the table before we get started. The process is designed to get you into court
quickly and cheaply, and then we’ll work it out later.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
an <i>exception</i>. There are certain
defenses that can be made by motion.</span></p>

exceptions in (h). You can even combine
all seven in one motion!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>(h)
This is the hierarchy. There are certain
disfavored notions that are waived if you don’t bring them all together first
with your answer or before your answer. However, 12(b)6 or 12(b)7 can be brought up any time, all the way up to
trial. Subject matter jurisdiction can
be raised at <i>any time</i>, because it is the <i>most favored defense</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>All
we need to do in easy <i><a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i> is
figure out what law the federal courts apply. That’s <i>the law</i> of the state in which they sit, and <i>the law</i>
means statutes and court decisions.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></span></i><span> itself said that state law on level of duty
was <i>substantive</i> and thus <i>must be applied</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="guarantytrustcovyork.htm">Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</a></span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case gives us the <i>outcome-determinative </i>test. We don’t look at the name given to the rule <i>by
the state</i> to determine whether the rule is substantive or procedural. We want to ensure the case will come out
substantially the same whether it is tried in federal court or state
court. The problem is that this test
goes too far: a lot of crazy little things can be outcome-determinative! Recall the reduction of the paper sizes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
we apply </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>York</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span> literally, then the FRCP
will kind of wither and die, because virtually every rule will run up against a
state rule in conflict.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Post-<i>York</i>,
there is confusion among the courts about how to apply or limit the rule.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Eerie
<i><a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i></span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In <i>Ragan
v. Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Co., </i>we have a car wreck in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Kansas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The car accident happens, and the filing is
made within the state statute of limitations, but the defendant was not served
within the statute of limitations.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Kansas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> has a 2 year statute of
limitations, but does the clock start when the lawsuit is filed, or when the defendant
is served?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
federal rules are very simple: Rule 3 says that an action is commenced with
filing. <span class=GramE>So if we
follow the federal rule, the lawsuit is timely, and we’re good to go.</span> On the other hand, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Kansas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> has a statute that says
that an action is commenced at the <i>date of service</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
we apply the outcome-determinative test to this, the outcome will definitely be
affected if we use federal instead of state rules. Do we follow the state rule in this
case? According to <i><a
href="guarantytrustcovyork.htm">York</a></i>, we must, and that’s what the Supreme
Court holds in <i>Ragan</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
wait, it gets better! In <i>Cohen v.
Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp.</i>, which was a shareholder derivative action, a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New Jersey</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statute says that you must
post a bond to cover fees. The idea of
the statute is to discourage frivolous derivative actions. The federal rule, on the other hand,
prescribes how derivative actions will be handled in the federal courts. But there’s <i>no bond</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
federal rule has no bond. The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New Jersey</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statute says you have to
use a bond. Is this
outcome-determinative? Yes! Thus, the Supreme Court holds that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New Jersey</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> state law trumps FRCP Rule
23.1. </span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
third case in the trilogy was <i>Woods v. Interstate Realty Co.</i> Under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, you can’t sue in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> as a foreign corporation unless
you designate an agent for service of process in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Under federal rules, there would be no
problem for a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Tennessee</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> company to sue in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> without any such
agent. The Supreme Court held that the state
statute trumps the FRCP again!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In <i><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i>, Justice Reed admonished us that “no
one doubts federal power over procedure”. However, in practice, when we applied the outcome-determinative test,
the FRCP got eaten up by competing state laws! Our rules are getting killed off!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Thus,
the stage is set for a <i>new rule</i>, which we get in…</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="byrdvblueridgeelectriccooperative.htm">Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric
Cooperative</a></span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
are the facts here? We are in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >South Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and we have a hurt
worker. The worker is from, let’s say, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >North Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:
 14.0pt;'>Blue Ridge</span></st1:place><span> is in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >South Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Mr. Byrd gets fried, and so he sues. That’s <i>fried</i>, not <i>fired</i>. <span class=GramE>Like <i>zapped</i>.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Byrd
sues for his injuries in federal court in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >South Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. What’s the problem with his suing </span><st1:place><span
 >Blue Ridge</span></st1:place><span>? It’s not clear whether Byrd is an employee,
as far as the statute goes, or not.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Blue Ridge</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> hired an independent contractor who in turn hired Byrd. Byrd is an employee of the contractor. </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:
 14.0pt;'>Blue Ridge</span></st1:place><span> wants to argue that Byrd is
more or less just like an employee in terms of the worker’s comp statute.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
worker’s comp statute says that employers pay for the worker’s comp
system. Employees get benefits for
on-the-job injuries, and in return, employers get immunity from tort suits by
employers.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Thus,
if </span><st1:place><span>Blue
 Ridge</span></st1:place><span>
can establish that Byrd is a <i>statutory</i> employee, his suit is <i>barred</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
the <i><a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i> issue? It’s a “who gets to decide” question. The legal issue is whether he’s an employee
or not. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >South Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> says that the judge decides
who is an employee and who isn’t.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
might they make this policy? The judge
might be more experienced in making such determinations. What might the jury do? They might be biased against the
employer. The hurt employee is quite
sympathetic. The jury might sort of
nullify. There also may be more
consistency over time if you let the judge decide.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the other hand, under the Seventh Amendment, suits at common law must be tried
by jury. This doesn’t exactly say that a
jury gets to decide who is an employee under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >South Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law. Does the Seventh Amendment require that a
jury decide this issue? No. The Court tells us that it isn’t a constitutional
issue. Yet, the rationale used by the Court
<i>is</i> the Seventh Amendment.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
does the Court really tell us? What is
it about the Seventh Amendment that’s important? It’s not unconstitutional to run things in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >South Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> the way they’re run. What’s the deal?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the Eerie </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Erie</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span> three, we had several easy
conflicts where the state rule won out.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court says that the federal courts are run by rules that are <i>under the
influence</i> of the Seventh Amendment, but not controlled by it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
result of this case is that the federal court will allow the jury to determine
the immunity issue. The reason isn’t
that this is required by the Seventh Amendment, it’s just that it’s <i>influenced
by </i>the Seventh Amendment.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
what’s our new test? It’s not just “under
the influence”, but also, it’s <i>uncertain </i>whether a different result
would follow from applying the federal rule instead of the state rule.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
happens if we apply <i><a href="guarantytrustcovyork.htm">York</a></i> to this
case? Brennan thinks that using the federal
rule instead of the state rule is <i>not </i>outcome-determinative, and thus we
would use the federal rule. <i>We only
use the state rule if it’s outcome-determinative.</i> This ruling could have been fit into the </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span
  >York</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span> rule easily, but the Supreme
Court wants to announce a new rule.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Instead
of the outcome-determinative test, now we have…</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The
<i><a href="byrdvblueridgeelectriccooperative.htm">Byrd</a></i> Balancing Test</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
test is derivative of the earlier test. There
are three questions that you ask when you deal with <i><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i> questions:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span
dir=LTR><span>Is the state
rule bound up with rights and obligations?</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is the substantive question. In <i><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i>, the state rule had everything to
do with rights and obligations, so the state rule applied.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the answer is <i>yes</i>, state law applies.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the answer to this first question is <i>no</i>, however, you ask the second
question.</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span
dir=LTR><span>Will applying
the state rule <i>dictate</i> the result of the case?</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
comes out of <i><a href="guarantytrustcovyork.htm">York</a></i>. In <i><a href="guarantytrustcovyork.htm">York</a></i>,
the answer was yes. If the state rule <i>is
</i>outcome-determinative, we must ask a third question:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span
dir=LTR><span>Are there
countervailing considerations?</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>For
example, what is the interest in the federal forum as opposed to the state
forum? Compare this to the issues of personal
jurisdiction and the balancing tests you find there.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
apply this to <i><a href="byrdvblueridgeelectriccooperative.htm">Byrd</a></i>!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In <i><a
href="byrdvblueridgeelectriccooperative.htm">Byrd</a></i>, the state rule is <i>not</i>
bound up with rights and obligations; it is not a rule that is bound up with
the substantive law of the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >South Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The rule seems to be part of the “form and
mode” of enforcing immunity rather than determining <i>what immunity rights are</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Will
applying the state rule dictate the result of <i><a
href="byrdvblueridgeelectriccooperative.htm">Byrd</a></i>? Brennan says that if outcome were the only consideration,
there would be a strong case for the federal courts following the state
rule. However, we check out the third
question.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
there any countervailing federal consideration that outweighs the state rule? The Seventh Amendment wins out here! We won’t “disrupt” the regular federal method
of dividing up power between judges and juries.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Wright
described this decision as the most “Delphic” of the Supreme Court’s major <i><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i> decisions.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Fairman
says that the main advantage of <i><a
href="byrdvblueridgeelectriccooperative.htm">Byrd</a></i> is that it gives us a
chance to consider the federal forum’s interest in running things a certain
way. This case helps us to preserve the
rest of the federal rules and stop the killing off of all the <span
class=SpellE>FRCPs</span>! It stops the
erosion of the Eerie </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span style='font-size:

Wrongful Death Act because that law is favorable to him in his recovery. But </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why the heck did the lawyers in <i>World-Wide</i> think it was worth
          getting to the Supreme Court? What interests did they have? The
          plaintiff�s lawyers are forum shopping. They want to be in a
          particularly plaintiff-friendly county in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          (which fortuitously is the county where the accident happened), and
          they want to be in state court rather than federal court. How come?
          The state courts choose juries in a different way than federal courts
          do. For example, you might choose juries by voter registration or you
          might go by automobile registration.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Furthermore, this is a tactical move. The Robinsons, it will be
          argued, are still </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          residents, and thus there is no diversity jurisdiction for federal
          court since Seaway and World-Wide are </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          corporations. If Seaway and World-Wide are gone, removal to federal
          court is a defendant�s right under 28 U.S.C. � 1441, if the case could
          have been <i>originally brought</i> in federal court. As long as
          Seaway and World-Wide are in on it at the beginning, that suit
          <i>can�t</i> be originally brought, because you�d have </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> on both sides of the �v.�.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Therefore, this lawsuit
          <i>cannot be removed to federal court.</i> �Very smart plaintiffs�
          lawyers: They designed their litigation package to keep it in the form
          that they want�at least temporarily.�</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If it went to federal court, but you successfully argue that it must
          go back to state court (�fraudulent removal�), it will get remanded
          back to state court. It�s a good strategy to remove a case to federal
          court if you can at all, even if you get remanded again, because you
          get a six month delay before you relitigate in state court. These are
          superunderhanded tactics!</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So if Seaway and World-Wide get taken off of the case, it becomes a
          removable case. That�s what happens after the Supreme Court�s opinion
          in <i>World-Wide</i>. Right after the Supreme Court rules, VW and Audi
          will have the case removed to federal court. Long story, but they
          ultimately get nothing in 1996. The Robinsons are big losers.</span

<p><i><span><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></span></i><span>, the case, isn’t really difficult at
all. It’s all about interpreting the
phrase “the laws of the several states”. Justice Story said that “laws” meant “statutes”. This was overturned by <i><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i>: from now on, in diversity cases,
the federal district court will apply the law of the state in which the court
sits, and “the law” includes both statutes and court decisions.</span></p>

<p><span>Brandeis
said that part of the point of <i>Swift</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<br/>

<p><span>We
no longer have to worry about Story’s limited view that statutes are the only
thing we mean when we talk about “the law”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a> </span></i></b><b><span>as theory</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Brandeis
suggests that <i>Swift</i> was based on a philosophy of Natural Law. What Brandeis represents, on the other hand,
is a legal <i>realist</i> perspective: “There is no law without some enforcing
authority.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
how does it all work? In most cases,
this won’t be very difficult.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
and D get into an accident in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. D was driving O’s car. A sues D. D wants to do a third-party claim against the owner. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> allows it, though it doesn’t
have a statute, but most states don’t. What shall we do if we’re in federal court? We have to use </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>’s law. This is pretty simple.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
we’ve got problems! The <i>Klaxon</i>
rule says that the federal court applies the “choice of law” law of the state
in which it sits. This is a variant of <i><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a>. </i>If the court really wanted uniformity, this is where it screwed
up. If there was one set of rules on
what law should be applied, it would give us a much greater sense of
certainty. Recall <i><a
href="piperaircraftvreyno.htm">Piper</a></i> and its complications.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span><a
href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a> </span></i><span>says that you must apply the “law of the
state”. But how do you determine what
state law is? If there’s a statute, that’s
what you apply. What if there is no statute? Where do you turn next? We look at the case law of the highest court
in that state. Even if they’re wrong in
the view of the United States Supreme Court, there’s nothing the federal courts
can do about it. <i>That’s federalism
for ya.</i></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Look
for statutes, then for State Supreme Court cases. But it’s probably not usually going to be
that easy. If there isn’t a definite
ruling from the State Supreme Court, the federal court must make their </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span
  >Erie</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><i><span> </span></i><span>“guess”: they must take a
stab at predicting what the State Supreme Court would do. There are two ways to do this:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span
dir=LTR><i><span>Ask</span></i></span><span> the State Supreme Court
directly by “certifying a question” of state law. Most state courts can accept certified
questions. (This is rare, because it is
discretionary.)</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is where </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Erie</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span> questions typically come up
today.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But…Justice
Reed says that though the line between substantive law and procedure is “hazy”,
no one doubts that federal courts should be able to make their own procedure. <i>Or do they???</i></span></p>

<br/>

<p><i><span>It’s
hard to define the line between substantive law and procedure.</span></i><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="guarantytrustcovyork.htm">Guaranty Trust Co. v. York</a></span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here,
we’re talking about a statute of limitations which says “you can’t bring
such-and-such an action after such-and-such a date.” That sounds quite procedural, but it turns
out that <i>it’s not</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>York</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> sues Guaranty Trust for a
trust thingy. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >York</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> is a beneficiary of a trust
administered by Guaranty. There’s a
bunch of confusing stuff.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
suit was filed in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> federal district court. Don’t we use the FRCP? If the Federal Rules don’t govern the federal
courts, what do they cover? But we’re
not making a blanket decision about whether the Federal Rules apply.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
this case, we are looking at the statute of limitations. The defendant says we should apply the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statute of limitations,
which would result in the defendant winning. This is an <i>all-or-nothing deal</i>. If the statute of limitations applies, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >York</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s too late. If it doesn’t, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >York</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> can go ahead.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>York</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s argument is that their
suit was on the “equity side” of federal courts. The RDA says that it only applies to actions
at common law and not actions at equity. Today, there’s just one cause of action. There used to be actions at law and actions at equity. In the old days, statutes of limitations
applied to actions at law and not to actions at equity. So </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >York</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> says that the statute of
limitations doesn’t matter because I’m not suing at common law!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
lawsuit is filed in the Southern District of New York. Guaranty Trust moves for summary judgment and
they get it. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >York</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> appeals to the Second
Circuit. The Second Circuit reverses,
buying into the plaintiff’s argument. Guaranty
appeals to the Supreme Court, and it reverses again, saying that we apply the
state statute of limitations even though the action is at equity.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
holding of the case is: <i>Federal courts sitting in diversity must apply state
statutes of limitations</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>That’s
all well and good and pretty simple, but that’s not the complicated part.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why,
after <i><a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i>, is there even a
question about applying this standard? Why did we have to have another Supreme Court case about this? Why would the litigants even have to raise
this issue?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
this really an </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Erie</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span> case? It could be argued that RDA does not specifically
apply to equity cases.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Also,
this case involves the application of a state statute which even under <i>Swift</i>
was always applied.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Some
people call this the <i><a href="guarantytrustcovyork.htm">York</a></i>
doctrine, rather than the <i><a href="erierailroadvtompkins.htm">Erie</a></i>
doctrine. They argue that <i><a
href="guarantytrustcovyork.htm">York</a></i> creates the mess. This is what is going to send us down the
road to repeated Supreme Court cases where something looks procedural, sounds
procedural, but it’s insisted that it’s <i>not </i>procedural.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
do we determine under </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Erie</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span> (or <i>York</i>) whether
something is <i>substantive</i>? We look
at the “outcome-determinative” standard.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We <i>don’t
</i>look at how states characterize their law. We don’t go by the labels that states themselves supply. Just because something is, for example, in
the New York Code of Civil Procedure doesn’t mean it’s procedural.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
also look at whether a statute deals with “manner and means of recovery” or
whether it deals with a “matter of substance”. We want the outcomes in state or federal court to be substantially the
same. We want diversity cases to be
dealt with the same way in state and federal courts to discourage forum
shopping, which we don’t like.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Yeazell
gives the example of paper size. Is this
procedural? Not by the
outcome-determinative test because if you file on the wrong size paper, your
complaint will get dismissed. That is
surely outcome-determinative!!! This
seems ridiculous, but that’s the rule according to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="guarantytrustcovyork.htm">York</a></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;;

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;;

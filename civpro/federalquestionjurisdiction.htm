          >First, Stevie gives us a bit of history: until a little after the
          Civil War, Congress declined to give the lower federal courts
          <i>general</i> jurisdiction over �federal questions�. Instead,
          Congress drafted statutes that gave federal courts jurisdiction in
          bits and pieces. This changed in 1875.</span

            >28 U.S.C. � 1331</a
          >
          gives federal district courts jurisdiction over cases �arising under�
          the Constitution, statutes, or treaties of the federal government. The
          problem is that nobody quite knows what �arising under� means.</span

            this employment relationship, the dispute does not <i>arise</i> from
            that Act because the problem is that the worker has overstated his
            hours.</span

            case that belongs in federal court. The plaintiff may argue,
            however, that the case does not <i>arise</i> from the First
            Amendment, but rather from libel law. The First Amendment issue is a
            defense, and thus is sort of <i>reactive</i> rather than
            <i>proactive</i>. I think this would be pretty solidly in federal
            court, though.</span

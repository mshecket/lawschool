        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The <span class="SpellE">Shutes</span> went on a cruise. On the
          ticket, there was a forum selection clause that said any litigation
          related to the cruise must be tried in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>. They departed for their cruise from </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Los Angeles</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span> and the ship sailed to </span
        ><st1:country-region
          ><st1:place><span>Mexico</span></st1:place></st1:country-region
        ><span> and back to </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Los Angeles</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span
          >. Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Shute</span> slipped on the ship and hurt
          herself. The <span class="SpellE">Shutes</span> sued in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          and Carnival moved for summary judgment due to the forum selection
          clause. At trial, the <span class="SpellE">Shutes</span> conceded that
          they had notice of the forum selection clause.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Procedural Posture:</span></b
        ><span>
          The suit was first brought in the Western District of Washington. The
          Ninth Circuit refused to enforce the clause, and the cruise line
          appealed to the United States Supreme Court.</span
        >

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> Is the forum selection clause enforceable?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Courts have the responsibility to determine whether forum selection
          clauses in form passage contracts are fair.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Court says that the ticket contract was a routine commercial
          passage contract. It was not negotiated, and the parties did not have
          equal bargaining power.</span

          In evaluating the fairness of such clauses, the Court must consider
          whether Carnival was, in bad faith, discouraging legitimate claims
          from its passengers. The Court says that because Carnival does
          business primarily in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State

            It�s tempting to say that lawyers must study every clause

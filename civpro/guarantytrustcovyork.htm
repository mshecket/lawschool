        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The plaintiffs sued for some stuff. The defendant countered by
          claiming that the </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">New York</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span>
          statute of limitations barred the plaintiffs� suit. The plaintiffs
          claimed that the </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">New York</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span> statute of limitations did not apply under </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place
            ><i><span style="font-size: 14pt">Erie</span></i></st1:place
          ></st1:City
        ><span>
          because their claim was in equity rather than in law. The Second
          Circuit found that the plaintiffs were right and that their suit could
          proceed. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Can the federal courts hear the suit even though it would be barred if
          it took place in state court between non-diverse parties?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          NEW RULE, AGAIN! The outcome of the case in federal court should be
          the same as it would be in state court.</span

      </p>

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span> The Court looks to the intent of the ruling in </span

            ><i><span style="font-size: 14pt">Erie</span></i></st1:place

          and asserts that it doesn�t matter whether state law is substantive or
          procedural as long as it will have an impact on the outcome of a
          case.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded, presumably to be
          dismissed by application of the </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> statute of limitations.</span>

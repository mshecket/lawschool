<p><span>We
will go through <i><a
href="washingtonequipmentmanufacturingcovconcreteplacingco.html">Washington
Equipment</a></i> and <i><a href="helicopertosvhall.html"><span class=SpellE>Helicopteros</span></a></i>

<p><b><i><span><a
href="washingtonequipmentmanufacturingcovconcreteplacingco.html"><span
class=GramE>Washington Equipment Manufacturing Co. v. Concrete Placing Co.</span></a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
happening? Where are we? Washington Equipment is in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and Concrete Placing is in
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Washington
Equipment made a contract to sell stuff to Concrete Placing. Concrete Placing didn’t pay the agreed upon
price. So we have a breach of contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Washington
Equipment sues in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> state court. The trial court dismisses for lack of general
personal jurisdiction over Concrete Placing.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
come this isn’t a case of specific jurisdiction? What is Washington Equipment suing for? It’s a breach of contract.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
does Washington Equipment’s cause of action relate to the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>? The contract was made in the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Therefore, the court can’t get specific
jurisdiction based on the sale of the equipment. Specific jurisdiction is not at issue; </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> can’t get it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Specific
jurisdiction is the easy route; general jurisdiction is the hard route. The procedural posture below tells us
something about the issues in the present case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
you have general jurisdiction over Concrete Placing, you may sue them in the
state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> for anything, anywhere, anytime. That’s tough to establish.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
why might </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> have general jurisdiction
over Concrete Placing? They got this
certificate to do business in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The plaintiffs argue that the statute that
requires this certificate implies consent to general jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>However,
the appeals court says that there is no general jurisdiction over Concrete
Placing in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> because they found no
legislative intent to force foreign corporations to consent to general
jurisdiction as a result of getting the required certificate.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if the legislature <i>did</i> have intent? Would such a statute be constitutional? Would it offend notions of fair play and substantial justice?</span></p>

<br/>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><i><span>General jurisdiction is
usually easy! It’s hard to find hard cases
on general jurisdiction.</span></i></p>

<br/>

<p><span>You
must have more of a relationship with a forum to constitute general
jurisdiction than to be subject to specific jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Think
of general jurisdiction as “super contacts”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
<i>result</i> of this case is right, however, the court’s explanation is <i>wrong</i>. That’s part of why the case is in the
book. The case is <i>wrong, wrong, <span
class=GramE>wrong</span></i> though with the right result.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Yeazell
dislikes the next case. He didn’t
include it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Having
made the special appearance, <span class=SpellE>Helicol</span> can’t appeal the
jurisdictional issue until the trial is complete. They do!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Texas Court of Appeals reverses the trial court, saying <span class=SpellE>Helicol</span>
isn’t subject to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> jurisdiction. The families appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court, which at first affirms the ruling of the Court of Appeals, but
ultimately reverse, which means that the trial court’s finding of “YES
JURISDICTION” stands.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Then,
the United States Supreme Court ends up reversing and saying that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> <i>doesn’t</i> have jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
big question: why isn’t <span class=GramE>this a</span> case of specific
jurisdiction? These are the helicopters
that they bought in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> that crashed. These are the pilots that they had trained in
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Why did they
go for general jurisdiction?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
practical reason that they don’t argue for specific jurisdiction is that the parties
allegedly <i>waived it</i>. That’s <i>unbelievable</i>. The parties concede that <span class=SpellE>Helicol’s</span>
contact were <i>not related</i> or <i>did not arise out of </i><span
class=SpellE>Helicol’s</span> activities in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
does the record of the oral argument show? Counsel seems to have retreated to general jurisdiction through a “Perkins”-style
argument, which is to say, they claim “systematic and continuous contacts” with
the forum state.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i><span>Perkins
v. <span class=SpellE>Benguet</span></span></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p><span>This
is a case that arose out of World War II. While the Japanese were occupying the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, a Philippine business
operated “in exile” in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. They got sued in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> after the war, and it was
ruled that they were subject to general jurisdiction in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> due to their “systematic and
continuous contacts” with </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Blackmun</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

isolation is not continuous and systematic. Fairman suggests that he should have looked at the contacts <i>in <span
class=SpellE>toto</span></i>.</span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

citing </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span>Rosenberg</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><i><span> </span></i><span>from 1923. But </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Rosenberg</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><i><span> </span></i><span>is pre-<i><a

<br/>

<p><span class=GramE><b><i><span>Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co. v. Curtis Brown Co.</span></i></b></span><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
defendant in this case was located in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and purchased merchandise
from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Representatives of the defendants made trips to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> that related to the
purchases. It was ruled that there were
not minimum contacts. But you might
argue that under <i>Shoe</i> there might have been sufficient contacts.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Brennan
objects: this case is from 1923! It’s
old!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about the pilots? <span class=SpellE>Blackmun</span>
says that’s <span class=GramE>it’s</span> part of the package of the
helicopters and training, so, citing </span><st1:City><st1:place><i><span
 >Rosenberg</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span>, they don’t matter.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about the bank checks? You’re not likely
to get general jurisdiction over writing </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> checks. <span class=SpellE>Blackmun</span> tells us
so. It’s doesn’t matter where you bank
for the purposes of personal jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We’re
got <i>crap!</i> Nothing left to support
jurisdiction at all. Therefore, there’s
no jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Fairman
is troubled by the way <span class=SpellE>Blackmun</span> does this. He creates a framework for how to look at
contacts in the future.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
the problem: you can look at the contacts apart or together, and depending on
how you do it, you’ll get to a different result.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Tomorrow,
we will start with two thoughtful questions and go over <i>Burnham</i>.</span></p>

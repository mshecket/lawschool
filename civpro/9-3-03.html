          Y. describes <i>McGee</i> as the �outer extreme� of jurisdictional
          aggressiveness. He speculates that if this case were to come up today,
          the modern Court would not come to the same conclusion. The contacts
          are <i>weak</i>�but there�s <i>something</i> about this. There
          <i>seem</i> to be contacts that warrant jurisdiction. It doesn�t seem
          to be <i>unfair</i>.</span

      <p><span>What are the facts of this case?</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>A woman has a trust established in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>. She moves to </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. She does some trust business and gets money from the trust. She
          dies. There�s a fight between family members over whether </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> or </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> has jurisdiction. If </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> has jurisdiction, one daughter gets everything, but if </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> has jurisdiction, then three daughters share equally.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>There�s a probate court in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Florida</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span>
          that says it has jurisdiction, and there�s a declaratory judgment
          action in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> that says there�s no jurisdiction outside the state of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Delaware</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span> over the trust.</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>What�s the result? </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          doesn�t have jurisdiction, and the greedy daughter doesn�t win.</span

          this one comes out that way.</span

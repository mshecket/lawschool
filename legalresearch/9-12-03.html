<p><span>What’s
on tap today?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=SpellE><b><span>Headnotes</span></b></span><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>West
takes points of law out of a case and puts a note about it at the top of the
case. You can’t simply rely on the <span
class=SpellE>Headnote</span>, though. Each <span class=SpellE>Headnote</span> has a Key Number. <span class=SpellE>Headnotes</span> are
reprinted in West’s Digest.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Lexis,
on the other hand, uses “core terms” and does a natural language search.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>West’s
Digests</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>This
is a comprehensive print index to published opinions to all courts. It’s useful <span class=GramE>if you don’t
have Lexis or Westlaw access or if you’re searching for older cases that aren’t
in Lexis or Westlaw</span>. It’s
obsolete for looking up cases, but now…something about shotguns.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
has an important, unanticipated constituency. If you’re in a particular field, you can go to any jurisdiction and find
cases on the same topic as the ones in your jurisdiction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
will use West’s Digests even though Westlaw is available. The Key Numbers are super useful.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Digests are arranged by topic and broken into increasingly specific
subheadings. The Digests are found after
the last Reporter for a particular state.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
you look up a topic, you can get a Key Number that guides you to cases in that
area.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
useful thing is that wherever you go in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> for the rest of your life,
Key Number 105(3) means what it means.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Once
you find <i>one good case</i> on a certain subject and you have the topic and
key number, you can crazy go nuts.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Use
the narrowest digest available.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Headnotes</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> are finding tools only. You
must read the case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Don’t
forget to check secondary sources too!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>All
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> and State Supreme Courts
publish all their decisions. Only
selected opinions are published from United States Circuit Courts and District
Courts. However, at the state trial
court level, opinions are rarely published.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
is the color of the most recent version of the <i>Federal Register</i>? It’s always white. Ha <span class=SpellE>ha</span> <span
class=SpellE>ha</span> <span class=SpellE>ha</span> <span class=SpellE>ha</span>
<span class=SpellE>ha</span> <span class=SpellE>ha</span> <span class=SpellE>ha</span>
<span class=SpellE>ha</span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Proposed
regulations and existing regulations are both in the <i>Federal Register</i> in
addition to presidential proclamations and executive orders.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Secondary
sources</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>These
are writings about the law that offer persuasive authority. Why would you want to use them? <span class=GramE>All sorts of reasons.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
do you cite a journal article? How do
you cite a book? Look at Bluebook rules
15-17.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Ride
the wave of the Secondary Continuum! Encyclopedias are very general, while law review articles are very specific. In between you have “nutshells”, “hornbooks”,
and treatises.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
are law review articles so specific? Well, there are tons of law journals; there are often several journals
at each law school and lots and lots of articles.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>General
Sources</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Encyclopedias
include American Jurisprudence and Corpus <span class=SpellE>Juris</span> <span
class=SpellE>Secundum</span> (CJS). These can be found on those low reserve shelves in the library. They are super general and they’re not
written by experts.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Now,
let’s get the assignment for case law!</span></p>

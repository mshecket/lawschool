        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The defendant leased a storefront to the plaintiff. However, on the
          day the plaintiff was supposed to take possession, the previous tenant
          was still wrongfully occupying the storefront and didn�t leave until
          about three weeks later after the landlord went to court to have the
          old tenant removed. The plaintiff sued for breach of the duty to put
          him in possession on the first day of the lease based on theories of
          both an express duty and an implied covenant. The trial court found
          for the plaintiff, and the defendant moved for a nonsuit and a
          directed verdict.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the lease contract impose a duty on the lessor to put the lessee
          in possession of the storefront on the first day of the lease
          term?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          When the term of a lease is set to begin at some point in the future,
          the lessor has a implied duty to make sure the premises are available
          for the new tenant�s immediate legal
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and actual</i> possession on
          the first day of the lease.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The basic idea is when parties bargain over the lease, they�re not
          merely bargaining for the right to sue to eject someone who is there
          wrongfully, but to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">actually be able to move in</i
          >. I think this might be a good Coase Theorem problem, because it�s
          probably a little cheaper to bargain just for the right to sue than
          for the right to actually possess. The cost of ejecting the previous
          tenant (or maybe eventually ejecting the lessee) is probably built
          into the cost of the lease if that responsibility rests on the
          landlord.</span

        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The defendant�s motions are denied and the verdict is upheld.</span

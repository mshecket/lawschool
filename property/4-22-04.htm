<p><span>It’s
a three hour exam. There are two typical
law school essay questions <span class=GramE>except</span> shorter. There are 80 multiple choice questions and
then 7 or 8 short answer questions that can be answered in a couple of
sentences. Braunstein tries to make the
exam correspond with how much time we spent on each topic in class. So keep that in mind when you’re studying.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>More on nuisance</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is like the law of servitudes in that it restricts what one can do with one’s
own land, which would make it like a negative servitude. But it’s also in a sense like an affirmative
servitude. If we <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>deny</i> someone an injunction for a neighbor’s annoyance, then it
gives the neighbor an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>affirmative </i>servitude. The denial of an injunction is kind of an
implicit endorsement of the annoying use of someone else’s property. The law of nuisance is complicated by the
fact that there is no agreement between the parties.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span><a
href="blanksvrawson.htm">Blanks v. Rawson</a></span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is the easy case. The developer had the
authority to basically change the rules at will. You might want to be careful about buying
into a subdivision where the developer can change the servitudes at will. You don’t know what the servitudes are going
to be, and the servitudes may not run. Why won’t they run? The question
is whether the covenant “touches and concerns”. Why? Does the benefit touch and
concern land? Braunstein isn’t sure, but
he could argue that it doesn’t. If the
developer has the right to change the servitudes at will, it looks like the
benefit is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>personal</i> to the developer,
and thus is in gross. The biggest
problem, of course, is that you simply don’t know what you’re buying into.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
a nuisance per se? It is something that
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inherently</i> a nuisance. What would be an example of this? Braunstein says that the only thing that is a
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>true</i> nuisance per se is something
that is prohibited by law, for example, having a house of prostitution. It doesn’t matter where you do it or how you
do it, it’s a nuisance because it violates the law.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Who
is interfering with whom in this case? Consider the basketball hoop: two people both want to use their property
in a reasonable way. You usually put a
basketball hoop next to the driveway. That seems reasonable. But at the
same time, it’s reasonable to not want to listen to some kids play basketball
and listen to the radio. Neither side is
being unreasonable; the problem is that they’re located so close to each
other! They’re each trying to impose a
restriction on the other’s reasonable activity.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
wasn’t the basketball court a nuisance? It
is found to be an anticipatory nuisance at best. The noise might have been a nuisance, and
that only happened once. The kid turned
down the radio when he was asked to. The
court says that this isn’t unreasonable, and furthermore, the court says that
you can have a nuisance even before the obnoxious activity commences. You have the chance to prove that no matter
how carefully the activity is carried out, it will be a nuisance. But that’s not shown here.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
dog pen is a nuisance per <span class=SpellE>accidens</span>. The problem is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>where it’s located</i> (close to the property line) and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>how it’s maintained</i> (not very well). The court enjoins them from using it, at
least insofar as it remains a nuisance.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about the high fence? The jurisdiction
doesn’t recognize a prescriptive easement of view. It is referred to as a “hate fence”. Given the relationship between these
neighbors, the court thinks maybe this is an example of “good fences make good
neighbors”. Building a fence doesn’t
violate any restriction and isn’t a nuisance per se. The fence is built on the property line. Finally, except for the four negative
easements (like ancient lights) you can’t acquire a negative easement by
prescription because no wrongful act occurred when the Blanks looked over
Rawson’s property. Thus the statute of
limitations never started to run (remember the analogy to adverse possession).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Braunstein
says that this is a case that never should have gone to trial in the first
place.</span></p>

<br/>

<br/>

<p><span>Nuisance
law is a problem! If you think about it,
nuisance tends to protect the status quo. If you’re out in the middle of nowhere and you’re making bricks and
making dust and smoke, then it’s not a nuisance. What happens if someone wants to move in near
you? We may continue to say that this
activity is not a nuisance because you were there first, and thus the person moving
near you assumes the risk.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>If the law
of nuisance takes that position, then you “engrave” whatever the existing uses
are in the law, so they become protected. As development occurs, it becomes more and more likely that something
will be a nuisance. From the Industrial
Revolution on, cities developed rapidly and development was seen as a good in itself
in ways that we don’t think of it today. Nuisance was seen as hostile to development, especially because the
traditional remedy for nuisance was an injunction. That is, if you could prove that your
neighbor was doing something that constitutes a nuisance, you can enjoin your
neighbor from doing that thing. But the
problem is that socially desirable activities might be entirely blocked! These activities may impose externalities,
but overall they may be beneficial.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Courts
deal with this problem in one of two ways, as this case points out. The first was to limit the situation in which
injunctions would be granted, but not to limit the definition of nuisance, so
that we would continue to say that something is a nuisance but say that it can
be enforced by not just an injunction, but alternatively by money damages. The second option was to limit the situations
where a nuisance is found to exist. The
First Restatement says that there is only a nuisance if the annoyance outweighs
the utility <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>to the actor</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>to society as a whole</i>. This is a pretty unfair comparison between
the two parties! This is the doctrine of
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>comparative utility</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>One
of the most famous cases is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Boomer v.
Atlantic Cement</i>. This took place in
the </span><st1:place><span>Hudson
 River</span></st1:place><span>
valley. The cement company spewed out a
whole lot of dust which you pretty much have to do in order to make
cement. They also caused a lot of
vibration. Boomer and his neighbors
sued. The court would not grant the
injunction because they said that the social utility of the factory exceeded
the damage to the neighbors. The court
agreed to grant a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>conditional</i> injunction. Essentially, the court allowed the cement
company to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>buy <span class=GramE>a
servitude</span></i> over Boomer’s property. The company had a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>right</i> to
conduct a nuisance. The court admitted
it was a nuisance but refused to grant a permanent injunction. So presumably Boomer has been
compensated. If he wants to, Boomer can
sell his land and go live somewhere else. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This is the idea of the Second Restatement
rule: the court uses comparative utility to determine a remedy: if the utility
is great and the harm is less, then we will award damages rather than a
permanent injunction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
difference does it make if the court orders an injunction? Does it matter what remedy the court
imposes? What’s ultimately going to
happen? If the court enjoins the
feedlot, is the use really going to stop? Probably not, and the feedlot would just pay damages for contempt. Or if an injunction is not granted, the
neighbors could essentially “bribe” them to stop. It’s a classic <span class=SpellE>Coase</span>
Theorem problem! Whatever <span
class=GramE>remedy</span> the court grants, the highest valued use will
continue. The idea is that if you have a
well-organized scheme of property rights and transactions are cheap and lawful,
then the highest-valued use is the one that will continue. The thing that it overlooks is that while it’s
good for society as a whole, there are real wealth effects as between the
parties. If you enjoin the feedlot, the
feedlot will buy off the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs will be richer. If you don’t enjoin the feedlot, the plaintiffs
will buy off the feedlot and they will be poorer.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
try to make sense out of the Second Restatement: what does <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>intentional</i> mean in the Second Restatement? Does it mean that you have to have
malice? You just need to know that a
problem will happen or know that it is substantially certain to result. Knowing includes not just what you know at the
outset, but also what you know as you continue the activity. Even if you didn’t know at the beginning that
you were going to be causing these problems, you keep on with the activity even
after you learn that there was a problem: that makes the nuisance
intentional. What’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>unreasonable</i>? It’s defined
in § 826. If the utility of an activity
is greater than the harm, it is not unreasonable under § 826 (a). If the utility is greater than the harm, then
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>an injunction is not available</i>. Under § 826 (b), in order to be a nuisance,
the activity must be serious, and the cost of compensating the current plaintiff
and others who are harmed won’t put you out of business if you pay. The idea of (b) is that damages and
injunctions are both available when they would have the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>same effect</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
order to make cement useful, you must be located near where it’s going to be
used, and that’s going to be in urban areas. Do you automatically get an injunction if you can’t get damages? Say we decide that it’s not feasible for the
action to continue. Does that mean that
you get an injunction automatically? Let’s
say the social utility of doing something is 20 and the cost of compensating
people for the harm that’s being caused to them and others similarly situated
is 21. That activity should not
continue! Damages would have the same
effect as an injunction: if you can’t afford to compensate for the harm you’re
causing, you ought to go out of business! You’re in business because you have created a situation where you impose
externalities on your neighbors. Maybe
you make money because you are located close to the big city and you save lots
of money because you can blow crap all over your <span class=GramE>neighbors</span>
houses without paying for it. But
utility and harm are not easy to measure! Especially when it comes to environmental nuisances it is difficult to
prove causality.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
the Restatement is trying to do is say that if the harm of the activity
outweighs the utility, you get an injunction. If the harm is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>serious</i>, and it’s
possible for the activity to feasibly continue, you may impose damages. But if taking damages would cause them to go
out of business, you’re back to part (a).</span></p>

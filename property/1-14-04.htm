Coal</a></i></span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It’s
important to understand the difference between the Holmes and Brandeis
opinions. Brandeis thinks that the
public purpose is more important than Holmes thought it was: this is a problem
that exists <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>throughout </i></span><st1:State><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Pennsylvania</span></i></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Brandeis also thinks the coal company hasn’t
lost much.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The denominator problem</span></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span>Both
Holmes and Brandeis say you weigh the public benefit against the harm to the landowner. But what’s the harm to the landowner? We know what’s regulated, and we know what
the coal company can and can’t do. But
what <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraction</i> of their “total rights”
is infringed? Do we make the “denominator”
the entirety of the property that’s regulated? In that case, it’s a 100% deprivation. Or, on the other hand, do we make the “denominator” the entirety of the property
owned by the coal company? Is it
relevant if they “chop up” their property rights?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Brandeis
says: Look at all the coal they own. They’ve lost 100% of the value of the coal under the house, but they own
lots and lots of coal. Therefore,
Brandeis would argue, the burden on the coal company is not so great as Holmes
wants to claim.</span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span><a
href="penncentraltransportationcompanyvcityofnewyork.htm">Penn Central Transportation
Company v. City of New York</a></span></i></b><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>Grand
Central is a pretty building! What does </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> want? They want to protect historic buildings! Penn Central owns Grand Central and they want
to build an office building on top. That
would have gotten them millions of dollars in rent every year! They applied for it and got denied.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
was a very big case. It went all the way
to the Court of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and then to the U.S.
Supreme Court. It was a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cause celebre</i> at the time.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
Grand Central worth saving? Does anybody
really care? Leonard Bernstein did and a
lot of other people in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> did.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
does the lower court do? The trial court
grants an injunction. On appeal, the
intermediate appellate court says that the restrictions on Penn Central were
okay because they were for a public purpose.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Then
the high court says there’s no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>taking</i>
because there’s no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>physical invasion</i>. But we know that’s clearly wrong! The Court of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> analyzes the case as a
substantive due process issue.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Supreme Court says this is no good! The Court
goes through two stages of analysis. First, the Court asks whether the landmarks statute is constitutional on
its face. Since it is, the Court asks
whether the statute is constitutional in its particular application to Penn
Central.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The constitutionality of the
statute</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>Is
there a public purpose to the statute? Sure there is! It’s a public
purpose to have a beautiful city with beautiful architecture. That confers some benefit on the people who
live there. The regulation of aesthetics
is considered an appropriate state purpose.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Moreover,
not all exercise of the state police power constitutes a taking. When does the police power go too far? It can go too far if it frustrates “investment
backed expectations”. But just because
Grand Central is worth less than before doesn’t make it a taking. If it’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>just
zoning</i>, that’s okay. If it’s just regulating a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>nuisance</i>, even though it might have a severe effect on the value of
the property, that doesn’t make it a taking either. We all own land subject to certain laws and
regulations with respect to how we use it; there’s no absolute ownership. One of those laws is that you can’t create a
nuisance on your land. That’s actually
sort of part of your title.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court distinguishes the actual situation with a situation where the train
station had to be closed as a train station and reopened as a museum that would
be far less profitable than the station. That would certainly be a taking.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
how do you measure the amount of the investment in the building? Say they paid $1 million to build the
building in the 1920’s when it was constructed. Say the building is now worth $50 million. What is their “investment-backed expectation”? Is it the $1 million or the $50 million? The majority seems to look at the original
cost and the value of improvements, but not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>current
value</i>. This is not the way an
economist would look at it and this certainly isn’t how Penn Central would look
at it as a business.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you own property and the property has gone up in value, you make a decision on
the margin whether or not to sell it based not on the original value but based
on what it’s worth now. The economist
would say what’s relevant is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>opportunity
cost</i>: every day they make the decision that “I’d rather have this building
than, say, $20 million.” But that’s not
how the court is looking at it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
extent of the loss is important, but not dispositive: decrease in value by
itself is insufficient to establish a taking. The Court refers to the brick furnace case from </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >L.A.</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> There was a big decline in the value of the
regulated property, but because it was such a nuisance, it still wasn’t found
to be a taking.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
turn, when we look at whether the problem has decreased in value, we have the
denominator problem again. The majority
looks at the value of the airspace rights above Grand Central compared to their
entire holdings in the area. On the
other hand, the minority looks at the airspace rights as an independent
property right that has been taken away.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
dissent is saying that you look at the air rights and you find that those
rights have been taken away 100%. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There
is no plan that will satisfy the Commission and allow them to develop their air
rights. Therefore, the minority says
that they’ve gone too far.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Who
ultimately carried the day? Holmes or
Brandeis? The majority opinion is most
like Brandeis’s opinion. The dissent
says that Penn Central has been deprived of 100% of the air rights. The majority says they have been deprived of,
say, 10% of their total rights (including the train tracks, the other buildings
they own and all that).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
majority doesn’t focus on what they can develop. They focus on what they own and whether they
can get a “reasonable return” on their investment. The majority says that their investment expectations
have not been frustrated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
the dissent is saying is that it’s not necessary to invalidate all landmark statutes,
it’s just that the people who benefit from the statutes should pay the people
who incur the cost of preservation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Braunstein
doesn’t buy the argument that there’s “average reciprocity of advantage”
here. Penn Central gets to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>enjoy </i>their building and see how pretty
it is just like everybody else in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. They also get the benefit of the 400
landmarks located around </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. This argument strikes Braunstein as somewhat
facile: Penn Central is bearing a huge cost that nobody else has to bear. The Court says, however, that everybody in
the city benefits, and thus there is average reciprocity of advantage.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
other thing that the Court dismisses is the argument from </span><st1:place><i
 style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Crosby</span></i></st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>. A guy had a chicken farm and
military was flying planes over the farm. The planes scared the hens such that they wouldn’t lay eggs. The guy sued the government for compensation
for abridging his air rights. But the
majority says this case can be distinguished. In </span><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
 >Crosby</span></i></st1:place><span>, the government was
physically occupying the airspace and using it solely to benefit themselves,
that is, in its <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>enterprise capacity</i>. But the majority argues that </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >New York City</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> is not regulating for its
own benefit, but rather for the benefit for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>people</i> of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
majority concludes that this isn’t a take. It’s a regulation, but not one that “goes too far”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
is this statute constitutional <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as applied</i>
in this particular case? The majority
says that there is no interference with the property’s current use (as a train
station). The court again says that
investment expectations are protected and there is average reciprocity of
advantage.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The dissent in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="penncentraltransportationcompanyvcityofnewyork.htm">Penn Central</a></i></span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
dissent says: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>this is not zoning</i>, at
least not in the typical sense. Why not? This isn’t like the traditional use of zoning
laws. The minority says this is more
haphazard than zoning. You have 400
landmarks scattered in 31 different historic districts. Zoning regulates land use within an area, but
in this case the government is just picking and choosing. The minority thinks there is a problem of
fairness here: “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and so forth.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Also,
with zoning, you get hurt by the zoning, but you also benefit from the
restrictions on other people. I can’t
build a smokestack on my residentially-zoned land, but neither can my neighbors
so I’ll be able to breathe and stuff.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
dissent also denies that there is average reciprocity of advantage.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
minority also says that the analogy to regulations that prohibit nuisances is
not apt. Everybody agrees that
regulation of a nuisance is no taking, but nobody’s saying that Grand Central, if
it was developed as proposed, would be a nuisance. In fact, it would be in compliance with all
other </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>New York City</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> regulations <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>except</i> the landmark law.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Finally,
the dissent believes Penn Central has suffered a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>total loss</i>: they choose the entirety of the air rights as the “denominator”
here.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
this isn’t the end of the story! The
see-saw is going to flip back by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a

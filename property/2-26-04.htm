        <span
          >At common law, they couldn�t stand that idea that no owner was
          entitled to possession of property at a given time. Therefore, if the
          contingent <span class="SpellE">remaindermen</span> are not ready to
          take when the previous estate terminates, we just kill the contingent
          remainder and the property goes to whatever the next vested estate is.
          The common law didn�t like abeyance of seisin!</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >�To A for life and then in fee simple absolute to B�s children who
          survive <span class="GramE">A</span>�: A has a life estate, B�s
          children have a contingent remainder, and O has a remainder in fee
          simple absolute.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if B dies leaving children and then
          <span class="GramE">A</span> dies? The contingent remainder turns into
          a possessory estate in fee simple absolute.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if <span class="GramE">A</span> dies during B�s lifetime and B
          doesn�t have any children? The contingent remainder will be wiped out.
          O gets the land back on the reversion and gets a possessory fee simple
          absolute.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if while <span class="GramE">A and</span> B are still alive, A
          conveys her life estate to B? What if A conveys her life estate to O?
          So A has a life estate at first, B�s children have a contingent
          remainder, and O has a reversion. When A conveys the life estate to B,
          it becomes a life estate
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">pur</i></span
          ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">
            <span class="SpellE">autre</span> vie</i
          >. What if A conveys the life estate to O? Then I think O gets back
          the possessory estate in fee simple absolute. Yes! And the contingent
          remainder is destroyed. Recall that the only way that possession could
          �spring� from O to the children would be with an executory interest
          which was not allowed before the Statute of Uses.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >�To A for life and then to A�s first born son. A dies childless, but
          a son is born 6 months after his death�: A has a life estate, A�s
          first born son has a contingent remainder, and O has a reversion. It
          turns out that children are considered to be in being from the time
          they are conceived <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">if</i> they
          are born alive. So it turns out that the contingent remainder is
          maintained. Then, when the child is born, the child gets the
          possessory estate. This isn�t terribly logical because it�s not a
          debate over when life begins. This is a way of protecting
          <span class="SpellE">afterborn</span> children. If you don�t have the
          rule of destructibility of contingent remainders, we wait for this
          event. �It�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">just an exception</i>. It
          doesn�t have to make sense!�</span

        <span

          preserving contingent remainders and for the benefit of the children
          of B who survive A if they attain the age of 21�: A has a life estate,
          then T has a legal vested remainder in fee simple absolute. The
          children of B who survive <span class="GramE">A</span> have an
          equitable contingent remainder in fee simple absolute. O has a legal
          reversion.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if A dies when B�s oldest child is 14? Then T has a legal fee
          simple absolute. Then the children of B still have an equitable
          contingent remainder in fee simple absolute. But does the contingent
          remainder get destroyed? No, because it will hold up in the courts of
          equity. At law, T is just sitting there with a regular old possessory
          estate. T has seisin! There is no gap! We have
          <span class="GramE">intervened</span> a trustee who will stand there
          for the purpose of preserving contingent remainders. The trustee has
          seisin, and has a legal fee simple absolute, recognized at law. The
          children have an equitable fee simple absolute. If the children reach
          the age of 21, the Statute of Uses will execute the now �dry� trust
          and give the children both a legal and equitable estate.</span

      <p>
        <span

          be appointed. But the safest thing to do is to have more than one
          trustee so if one dies you�ll have a backup. Also, the trustee has all
          the management functions.</span

          estate in William and purports to create a remainder in William�s
          �lawful heirs�. Finally, William�s widow claims that William�s life
          estate and the heirs� remainder are in trust, and therefore they are
          both equitable and of the same quality. Therefore, she argues, the
          Rule in Shelley�s Case applies. When that rule applies, it makes it
          such that the remainder is also in the life tenant. The interests
          merge together, and the person who

          both equitable or both legal? The heirs say that as soon as William
          died, the trust terminated and the property went to them as a legal
          fee simple absolute. They argue that their estate was legal, while
          William�s estate was legal, and therefore the rule shouldn�t apply.

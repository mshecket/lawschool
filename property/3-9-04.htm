          >��Orville to <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> for life, then to his
          widow, and then to his children who survive her.� Assume that
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> is 89 and is married to Bella, his
          wife of 65 years [that�s a long time!], and that they have three
          children�: First off, purportedly,
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> has a life estate, his widow has a
          contingent remainder for life (because it is unascertained just who
          his widow will be or whether he�ll have one, like if he gets divorced)
          and then a contingent remainder in fee simple absolute to his children
          who survive whatever widow he leaves behind (they may or may not be
          ascertained). Here we have the �unborn widow� problem at common law.
          Let�s say Bella and all the children die, but
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> remarries, say to
          <span class="SpellE">Cruella</span>, who wasn�t born at the time of
          the gift. <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> works as the validating
          life for the gift to <span class="SpellE">Cruella</span>.
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> and
          <span class="SpellE">Cruella</span> (miraculously) have a kid,
          <span class="SpellE">Donatello</span>. Then
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> dies (and thus both his widow and
          his children are ascertained at his death). It may be more than 21
          years before we know whether
          <span class="SpellE">Donatello</span> will survive
          <span class="SpellE">Cruella</span>. Therefore, strangely enough, the
          gift to <span class="SpellE">Cruella</span> (or Bella or any other
          potential widow) will be okay, but the gift to
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid�s</span> children fails and thus Orville
          keeps a reversion in fee simple absolute. Note that the children in
          being at the time of the gift don�t work as validating lives for
          anybody, either. There is no life in being that will make this gift
          valid. Note that this gift would succeed if all the recipients of the
          gift were named. Actually, all you would need to do is name
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">the widow</i>. So, in the end,
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> has a life estate, the children have
          a contingent remainder in fee simple absolute, and Orville has a
          reversion.</span

          was going to reach the age of 30. However, if the rule of
          destructibility is still in effect, the gift would be okay because we
          would know at the time of Abby�s death whether the
          <span class="SpellE">remaindermen</span> are ready to take. The

          Purportedly, there is a life estate in Alan, followed by a contingent
          remainder in fee simple absolute to Orville�s heirs, and a reversion
          in Orville (again, mostly fictional, but must be there because he gave
          away a vested estate of a lesser quantum than what he had). But under
          the Doctrine of Worthier Title, the remainder to Orville�s heirs
          becomes simply a reversion in Orville. So the gift would be the same
          as if you simply said: �Orville to Alan for life.� The contingent

          as the land is used for charitable purposes.� Subsequent to this
          conveyance, Orville conveys his property �to Binford and his heirs��:
          Initially, and purportedly, Alana has a fee simple determinable and
          Orville has the possibility of reverter. Then Orville sells what he
          has to Binford. It is quite uncertain whether the possibility of
          reverter can be sold or not (in other words, whether it�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">alienable</i>). If it can�t be,
          then things they as they are and no rules are violated. If it is sold,
          �the name stays the same� and Binford has the possibility of reverter.
          Is the possibility of reverter valid? Sure, because it�s vested right
          from the start and forever. The thing is, if these two conveyances
          were made in the same gift, then Alana would have had a fee simple
          determinable, also known as a fee simple subject to an executory
          limitation, and Binford would have had an executory interest. However,
          that executory interest would have been killed by the Rule
          <span class="GramE">Against</span> Perpetuities, because that interest
          could stay contingent way, way, way into the future and far beyond the
          deaths of both Alana and Binford. You never know how long the land
          will be used for charitable purposes! It could be hundreds of

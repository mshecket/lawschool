          maybe even a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent], and Bonnie
          has an executory interest in fee simple absolute [it can�t be a

          Andy could die and his heirs could be on the land for hundreds of
          years, farming, and then stop. So it could be hundreds of years before
          the executory interest would turn possessory. That violates the Rule
          Against Perpetuities! So we have to reclassify, and Andy has a fee
          simple determinable (it�s no longer subject to an executory
          limitation�and it�s definitely not a fee simple subject to a condition
          subsequent either) and Orville has a possibility of reverter. Bonnie
          has nothing. It would fix it to say �To Andy and his heirs so long as

          has a fee simple determinable and Orville has the possibility of
          reverter. The Rule Against Perpetuities isn�t violated in this case.
          But what if the Orville sold the possibility of reverter to Bonnie?
          That�s why possibilities of reverter were difficult to sell. What if
          the gift was: �To A and her heirs, but if the land is not farmed to B
          and her heirs�? A has a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent,
          B has an executory interest in fee simple absolute. But is the Rule
          Against Perpetuities violated? Yes, because you could farm forever! It
          could fail to vest in B in 21 years. Therefore, the gift to B and her
          heirs is no good! It looks like A just has a fee simple absolute and O
          has nothing! That�s why we need to distinguish between fees simple
          determinable and fees simple subject to a condition subsequent. With
          the fee simple determinable, the farming condition is part of A�s
          estate. When you cut off the executory interest, the condition is
          still part of it and A has the possibility of reverter. On the other
          hand, with the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, you have
          the condition about farming being part of the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">executory interest</i>, so when
          that interest gets cut off, the condition does too. These are
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">radically different results</i>
          depending merely on where you put the comma!</span

          subject to an executory limitation, Brooke has an executory interest
          for life, and Orville has possibility of reverter. Brooke�s gift
          doesn�t violate the Rule Against Perpetuities because it can only vest
          during her lifetime. Thus, we can use Brooke as the life in being for
          that gift. If Brooke dies, her interest goes away and we�re just left
          with Orville�s possibility of reverter and Arthur�s fee simple
          determinable. Note that we can apply the rule before we figure out

          a life estate, Adam�s children have a contingent remainder for life
          (unless Adam already has children alive, in which case the children
          alive have a vested remainder subject to open [but that�s a contingent
          remainder for the purposes of the Rule Against Perpetuities]), and
          Adam�s grandchildren either have a contingent remainder in fee simple
          absolute or a vested remainder subject to open in fee simple absolute
          (this remainder is contingent for two reasons: we don�t know who they
          are, and they must survive their parents). The gift to the children is
          okay, because the children will be ascertained when Adam dies. If Adam
          has more children after the date of this gift, then Adam dies and any
          other children and grandchildren die, then we might not know whether
          there will be any grandchildren that survive the �new� child until 21
          years after the death of everyone living at the time of the gift.
          Thus, though the gift to Adam�s children will be okay, the gift to the
          grandchildren will violate the Rule Against Perpetuities and Orville
          will have a reversion instead. All in all, after the Rule, you�ll have
          a life estate in Adam, a life estate in Adam�s children, and a
          reversion in Orville.</span

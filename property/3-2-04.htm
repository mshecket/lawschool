          But the Rule in Shelley�s Case kicks in because, in the same
          instrument: (1) a life estate is granted to A, (2) the remainder is
          granted to A�s heirs, and (3) the two estates are legal estates. That
          means that A simply gets a fee simple absolute and A�s heirs get
          nothing (but they might get something when A dies).</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This doctrine is very similar to the Rule in Shelley�s Case. But
          instead of cutting off contingent remainders created in heirs of the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">transferee</i>, it cuts off

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">transferor</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The doctrine applies only to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">inter vivos </i>transfers, not
          to wills. The Rule in Shelley�s Case, on the other hand, applies both
          to wills <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and </i>to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">inter vivos</i> transfers.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>How come? Well, once you�re
          dead, we know exactly who your heirs are, and then the remainder is
          vested. There�s nothing contingent about it anymore!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >For example: �To A for life and then to the heirs of O�: This
          purports to give a life estate to A followed by a contingent remainder
          in fee simple absolute to the heirs of O, plus a reversion in fee
          simple absolute to O. After the operation of the Doctrine of Worthier
          Title, this would simply become a life estate to A followed by a
          reversion in fee simple absolute to O. So let�s say that O devises all
          of his property to the Red Cross. The Red Cross gets the reversion,
          and O�s heirs get
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">nothing</i>.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">classify</i>, (2)
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">apply the rule</i>, and finally
          (3) <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">reclassify</i>.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How about this? �To T, to be held in trust for O for life and then to
          O�s heirs�: It turns out that the trust income wasn�t enough to
          support O, and O wanted to know if she could terminate the trust. So
          let�s classify: T has a legal fee simple absolute, O has an equitable
          life estate, and O�s heirs have an equitable contingent remainder in
          fee simple absolute. Under the Doctrine of Worthier Title, T would
          have the legal fee simple absolute and O would have an equitable fee
          simple absolute. That means that O will be able to terminate the trust
          because she is the sole beneficiary.</span

        <span

          way to terminate the trust, because some of the trustees are
          unascertained. If all the beneficiaries agree, then the trust can be
          terminated.</span

      <p><span>Let�s do the problem!</span></p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >One question I failed to consider was whether there was a bailment at
          all.
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Did a bailment exist?</i> A
          bailment requires that the bailee actually take possession of the good
          with intent to possess or control. Did Diana deliver possession of the
          item to Irene? If this actually was a bailment, how would we classify
          it? Irene would argue that it was a gratuitous bailment for the
          benefit of the bailor. In that case, Irene is only liable if she was
          grossly negligent.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The main idea is that there are different standards of care depending
          on how you classify the bailment.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Then, on the other hand, there is a letter. Irene only knew that she
          had possession of a letter, but she didn�t know what was inside it.
          What�s the issue? Well, just what did Irene take possession of? Did
          she take possession of the envelope, or the envelope and its contents?
          It�s a question of intent. This question arises often. If you ever
          read the contracts on the back of claim checks when you pick up your
          car, it always says that the garage owner isn�t liable for theft or
          damage to the contents of your car.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So what was Irene�s intention with respect to the money? This is
          something a court would have to wrestle with. Was there an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">implied </i>bailment? Irene
          wasn�t just the bailee for the envelope. The envelope itself was
          worthless. It�s only the contents that have some value and may carry
          some liability if you lose them.</span

        <span
          >What about the second holding? It says that a prior possessor
          prevails against a subsequent possessor who is not the true owner.
          This isn�t what the court said in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="armoryvdelamire.htm">Armory</a></i

          true owner, and that�s what the court states, this must be at least
          partly dictum because the true owner isn�t before the court!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How about a third version of the holding? A prior possessor who is a
          finder prevails against a subsequent possessor who is a bailee. In
          other words, a finder prevails over a bailee.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The parties before the court were a finder and a subsequent
          possession. Anything that is said about the true owner must be
          dicta!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So�Braunstein claims that we can�t resolve our simple hypothetical
          based solely on
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="armoryvdelamire.htm">Armory</a></i
          >! How are we going to resolve the case? We�re going to look at the
          public policy reasoning behind the rule of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="armoryvdelamire.htm">Armory</a></i
          >. The court wanted to encourage public order, protect finders�
          reasonable expectations, minimize the effect on the law of bailments,
          and secure the return of the item to the true owner.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The fourth policy justification suggests that we want to find for the
          first finder, because in some sense the first finder is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">closer</i> to the true owner.
          The public order goal also pushes towards giving the thing to the
          first finder.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Braunstein is trying to make the point that you frequently cannot
          resolve cases just by looking at the rule. Often, there are multiple
          plausible holdings of a precedent-setting case, and these holdings may
          be in conflict. Therefore, you must look for a �higher authority� and
          consider the

          >for the rule.</span

          police. The police eventually turn over the brooch not to Hannah, but
          to Peel, the property owner, who sells it. Hannah sues Peel! What�s
          the issue?</span

      <p>
        <span

          the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">prior </i>(first)
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">possessor</i>? Is it the owner

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The judge starts with
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bridges v. Hawkesworth</i>. In
          that case, some money was found on the floor of a shop. The finder
          turns it over to the shopkeeper. They can�t find the true owner. So
          the question is: who is entitled to possession of the notes? It turned
          out that the notes went to the finder. The shopkeeper didn�t have
          possession as against the owner. What the court is saying is that if
          the true owner sued the shopkeeper because the notes went missing, the
          true owner would lose. The shopkeeper never accepted possession of the
          notes and never knew of their existence. The court leaps to the
          conclude that because the shopkeeper didn�t have possession against
          the true owner, the shopkeeper didn�t have possession against the
          finder either.
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">This is a big logical leap</i>.
          It might be right, but it fails to take into account the relativity of
          possession.</span

        <span
          >What else do we learn from
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bridges v. Hawkesworth</i>?
          Just because you�re the owner of land doesn�t mean you�re the owner of
          everything that sits on the land. So Peel is not
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">necessarily </i>going to win
          just because he�s the owner of the house. So the owner of the locus in
          quo doesn�t always possess things found on the land. The owner doesn�t
          win in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bridges</i>; the finder
          wins! Later we�ll find out that the holding of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bridges</i> was limited to
          public places. Then the question becomes whether or not a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">shop</i> is a public
          place.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >What is the relevance of intent? What was the intent of the
          shopkeeper? One thing we can get out of this case is that possession,
          as elusive a concept as it is, has
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">something</i> to do with
          intent. The judge in this case quotes Oliver Wendell Holmes, who says
          two types of intent must be present in order for there to be
          possession: (1) intent to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">appropriate </i>(use) and (2)
          intent to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">exclude</i> (exert

        <span

          to have the intent to appropriate
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">everything in the house</i>?
          Peel was compensated for the use of the house, but that doesn�t mean
          he intended to give up any of the stuff not related to the
          government�s occupation. We don�t know what Peel�s intent was. So
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bridges</i> doesn�t take us

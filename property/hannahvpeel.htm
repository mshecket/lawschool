        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The defendant�s manor was requisitioned by the military for use in
          World War II. A soldier staying there found a brooch. He turned it in
          to the police. When the owner couldn�t be found, the brooch was turned
          over to the owner of the manor instead of the solider. The manor owner
          sold it. The solider sued the manor owner for the value of the brooch,
          claiming �finders keepers�. The manor owner�s defense is that he has
          superior title to the brooch because it was found on his
          property.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          NEW(ish) RULE! A landowner owns everything
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">attached to </i>or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">under </i>the land, but not
          necessarily stuff lying on the surface of the land even though the
          stuff isn�t possessed by someone else.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court pours over the authorities, doing a lot of analogizing and
          distinguishing. The court first considers the rule of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="armoryvdelamire.htm">Armory v. Delamire</a></i
          >, then the more controversial
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bridges v. Hawkesworth</i>. The
          latter case says that the �finders keepers except to the true owner�
          rule applies no matter where the item is found. But then there is a
          third case that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">seems</i> to be
          in conflict. In
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >South Staffordshire Water Co. v. Sharman</i
          >, some rings were found embedded in some mud at the bottom of a pool
          (c.f. Lord of the Rings), and it was ruled that the finder didn�t get
          them because they were a part of the real estate, as it were.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court eventually comes to the rule above, and thus finds for the
          plaintiff.</span

          >Major Peel seems to have a couple of strikes against him: the
          plaintiff�s conduct was �meritorious� and Peel never lived in the
          manor. It seems like if Peel actually had lived in the manor, he could
          claim (even if falsely) that he knew the brooch was there, and thus
          possessed it just as he would any other personal property stored in
          the house. Matthew�s advice probably isn�t very useful legally. If you
          find the treasure, you should take the treasure with you instead of
          buying the field. If you plan to buy the field, but someone else digs
          up the treasure first, then you�ll lose out. I�m sure that�s not what
          Matt meant, though.</span

          distinguish it from
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bridges</i>: (1) The finder in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">South Staffordshire</i> was an
          employee of the landowners, and therefore the rings that were found
          become the property of the employer rather than the employee, or (2)
          the rings were not lying unattached on the land, but rather were
          �buried� under the mud, and thus were part of the landowner�s real
          estate interest. I think the court makes a good argument for why the
          rulings are indeed reconcilable. The court in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bridges</i> said that the money
          was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">lost</i> rather than
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">mislaid</i>, that is, it wasn�t
          left <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">intentionally</i>. The law
          of bailments therefore said that possession went to the finder instead
          of the landowner.</span

          >If we assume that the chimney sweep�s boy was employed by the tavern
          owner, then under one interpretation of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">South Staffordshire</i> the
          jewel belongs to the tavern owner. However, the chimney sweep�s boy
          could argue that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">South Staffordshire</i> stands
          for the proposition that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">buried</i> stuff belongs to the
          landowner, but loose stuff doesn�t, and thus the jewel belongs to him.
          On the other hand, the tavern owner could attempt to distinguish
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Hannah</i> by saying that he
          was in possession of the tavern, unlike Peel who never lived in his
          manor. The tavern owner could argue that Peel would have prevailed in
          that case if he had possession of the manor, and thus that the tavern
          owner should win in this case.<br />
          <br />
          If the tavern owner and chimney sweep�s boy both come to the jeweler,
          it seems like the proper thing to do would be to turn the jewel over
          to the police in anticipation of the matter being resolved in
          court.</span

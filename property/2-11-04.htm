        <span
          >What�s the difference between the first agreement that they made and
          the wills? The joint will talks about the nieces and nephews while the
          first agreement does not. Also, the will addresses personal property
          whereas the agreement does not.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the issue in the case? What rights do the nieces and nephews
          have? Jessie seems to have the right to dispose of or consume some of
          the property that is subject to the will. What does the language �then
          remaining� mean?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>What�s the </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>West Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          statute and what�s the common law rule of how you deal with a case of
          a life estate with a power in the life tenant to dispose of some or
          all of the property that is the subject of the life estate? What does
          the statute say? What was the common law rule? Under the common law
          rule, the nieces and nephews would get nothing because if you give a
          life estate the absolute power of disposal then they actually get a
          fee simple and the purported gift to the nieces and nephews simply
          fails.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But under the statute, the life tenant has the power to dispose, but
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">if</i> there�s anything left it
          goes to the folks who hold the remainder. The common law rule has been
          changed by the statute! The purpose is to give increased flexibility
          to the life estate.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Frequently, the support of the life tenant is the principal goal of
          the testator. For example: �To my spouse for life, and then to my
          children.� The goal is to provide for the spouse, but there is a
          secondary goal of providing for the children. So you can provide the
          life estate plus the added power to dispose. At common
          <span class="GramE"
            >law, that just mutates into a fee simple absolute, but by
            statute,</span
          >
          you can have this new category that�s kind of halfway in-between the
          two.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What rule does the court use? The court uses the statute. The result
          by statute is that Jessie gets a life estate, and then the nieces and
          nephews get a remainder in fee simple absolute. Braunstein suggests
          that because there was no power of disposal, it works out the same way
          under either rule.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So, what does �then remaining� mean in this court�s opinion? Doesn�t
          it necessarily imply a right to dispose? Does the court give it a
          different meaning? They give it the meaning of �ordinary use� or �wear
          and tear�. What would you have to add to make it clear that Jessie has
          the power to dispose? Would the words �if any� added after �then
          remaining� be sufficient? Do these words show a clear intent? It may
          be stronger than just <span class="GramE">what�s</span> there, but it
          may still fail. A court might still interpret this as the ordinary
          depreciation of the property.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This agreement may not have been drafted as well as it could have
          been.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say you convey �to A for life with power to dispose, then to B and
          her heirs�. Under the common law, we say that the gift to B fails and
          A gets a fee simple absolute. At common law, the idea of the power to
          dispose is repugnant to the idea of a life estate. On the other hand,
          under the statute, the second gift does not fail. The statute says
          that we�ll enforce the clear intent of the testator.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s dangerous about putting in (or leaving out) the power to
          dispose? There�s a risk either way. Land values go up.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>The cost of living goes up.
          The rents from owning a farm may be sufficient to live on at one
          point, but later not be enough. If the life tenant can�t sell any of
          the property, they may be left destitute. But on the other hand, the
          life tenant could turn out to be a spendthrift who gambles away the
          estate. So there is a danger either way that can only be resolved
          through careful drafting.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The legal life estate is a pretty inflexible way to accomplish the
          purpose it�s usually used for. The best way to accomplish the purpose
          of providing for the successive generations after the property owner�s
          death is a trust.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The purpose of a trust is to separate
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">management</i> of wealth from
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">enjoyment</i> of wealth. You
          create a manager, called the trustee, whose function is to make the
          property productive through investment and then dispose of the
          property according to the terms of the trust. So you have a trusted
          person who is responsible for management and enforcing the trust. But
          the trustee is not supposed to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">enjoy</i> the money. The
          trustee has a high standard of care and a fiduciary duty to the
          beneficiary.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The person that starts out with the money is called the
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">trustor</i></span
          >,
          <span class="SpellE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">settlor</i></span
          >, or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">grantor</i>. The
          <span class="SpellE">trustor</span> transfers the property to the
          trustee, but not for the trustee�s benefit. Then the trustee manages
          the property for the benefit of the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">beneficiary</i>. Sometimes,
          these three roles can be held by three different people. You might set
          up a trust in anticipation that you might become incompetent in the
          future, and set yourself up as <span class="SpellE">trustor</span>,
          trustee, and beneficiary. But then you provide that if you become
          incompetent, another trustee will be appointed.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The courts of law did not originally recognize and enforce this
          transaction. Instead, they would say that the trustee had a fee simple
          absolute. But the courts of equity
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">would</i> enforce trusts. So
          not only do we divide title between estates and future interest, but
          also between legal title and equitable title. That simply depends on
          which court you would go to in order to enforce the title.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So there are two kinds of title: legal and equitable. Both the
          beneficiary and the trustee could have a fee simple absolute. The
          trustee would have a legal fee simple absolute, while the beneficiary
          would have an equitable fee simple absolute. For our purposes, all the
          classifications remain the same, except when we talk about trusts. We
          say that the beneficiary has an equitable fee simple absolute and the
          trustee has a legal fee simple absolute. Both of them can have fee
          simple absolutes.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In a sense, this doesn�t make sense. We already defined fee simple
          absolute as the whole bundle of sticks, but now we�re saying that a
          legal fee simple absolute is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> the whole bundle of
          sticks.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Trusts are private and secret, which is a plus for many people. You
          won�t have to go to court to show that you�re not crazy, for
          example.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But trusts are expensive! It costs money to set one up, plus you
          probably have to pay the trustee.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Trusts are good for their purpose, but they�re expensive.</span>

        <span
          >You would say �to T in trust for B for life and then to C and his
          heirs�. Then T has a legal fee simple absolute, B has an equitable
          life estate, and C has an equitable remainder in fee simple absolute.
          T�s legal fee simple absolute gives the trustee the power to sell the
          property and invest the proceeds. Even though T�s legal estate is
          going to end, we call it a legal fee simple absolute because T has to
          be able to sell the property. T can�t enjoy the trust property. B is
          entitled to the income from the trust, and B
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">may</i> be able to invade the
          �corpus� of the trust, too. C gets whatever�s left when B dies.</span

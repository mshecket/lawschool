      <p>
        <span
          >What did El <span class="SpellE">Di</span> own at the beginning of
          the suit? El <span class="SpellE">Di</span> has a fee simple
          determinable! There�s a reversion in the restriction! Is there any
          �for so long as� type language? There�s an automatic reversion, so we
          would classify their property interest as a fee simple determinable.
          So what happens to the possibility of reverter? If it�s a fee simple
          determinable, the original grantor (the Bethany Beach Improvement
          Company) should automatically get the property back. The court doesn�t
          even mention the possibility of reverter! They just skip over it! When
          you�re talking about equitable servitudes, the courts tend to not
          enforce forfeitures. It is said that �equity abhors
          <span class="GramE">a forfeiture</span>�. The court is more likely to
          use an injunction.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Some conditions had changed. But were these changes enough to relieve
          them of the condition to not serve alcoholic beverages? Many of the
          lots in the original development were unrestricted. There was
          widespread tolerance of the practice of �brown-bagging�. You could
          BYOB. So should the covenant be declared unenforceable? What�s the
          standard for terminating <span class="GramE">a servitude</span> on the
          basis of changed conditions? �A court will not enforce a restrictive
          covenant where a fundamental change has occurred in the intended
          character of the neighborhood that renders the benefits underlying
          imposition of the restrictions incapable of enjoyment.� Was the
          benefit that the Christian Missionary Society sought to obtain from
          these covenants no longer capable of enjoyment? What was the goal of
          the people who imposed the restrictions? They were trying to create a
          small family community. They may also have been part of the temperance
          movement. But Bethany Beach has really changed: it attracts thousands
          of tourists every summer.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Braunstein suggests that when deciding this case, you need to
          consider exactly what the benefit was. If the benefit is that fewer
          people will drink alcohol, then maybe you need to consider the
          incremental benefit of each individual place where you can�t drink.
          Another issue is that El <span class="SpellE">Di</span> bought the
          property with the restriction and they knew that restriction existed.
          You can argue that El <span class="SpellE">Di</span>
          <span class="GramE">have</span> freedom of contract, chose to buy the
          lot subject to the restriction, and thus they should be bound by it.
          On the other hand, we have an overarching principle that we want to
          increase the alienability (or, more to the point,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">productivity</i>) of land.
          Thus, when a restriction on land is making it less productive, we
          ought to get rid of it.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So what is no longer enforced? Are all the restrictions dead, or just
          the �no sale of alcohol� restriction? The court confines their
          decision to this particular area. Some of the restrictions were
          relaxed, but not the other restrictions. What is the significance of
          the fact that the area was zoned for commercial purposes? If the city
          comes in and rezones an area, that doesn�t wipe out restrictions.
          Zoning is hierarchical. The �best use of all� is single family
          residences, and then it �goes down� from that. All uses are permitted
          that are �above� the category that you�re talking about. So in a
          commercially zoned lot, you can have commercial, multi-family, and
          single family use. Zoning establishes a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">floor</i>, and as long as
          you�re <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">above</i> that floor,
          the restrictive covenants are okay. In this case, the town council has
          declared as public policy that this area is not a residential area
          anymore, but rather a commercial area.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Say you have some land divided into a bunch of lots. Let�s say it
          fronts on a small two-lane road in the country. The city gradually
          comes to this area, and the subdivision finds itself part of a major
          city. The rural lane becomes a busy, four-lane commercial street with
          shopping malls and things like that. There are
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">changed conditions</i>. This is
          now a commercial neighborhood. So the lot owners say that they ought
          to be entitled to use their property for commercial purposes to,
          contrary to existing restrictive covenants. The problem here is that
          there�s going to be a domino effect. If the first line of lots goes
          commercial, then the next line of lots will go commercial, then the
          next, then the next. Isn�t this what�s going to happen with Bethany
          Beach? If one place can sell alcohol, then it won�t be long until all
          the businesses can sell alcohol.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Take High Street for example. If you turn into Clintonville, it
          becomes all residential. Typically, cases like the hypothetical above
          lose on the domino effect argument. Just because a few homes can�t
          enjoy peace and quiet doesn�t mean that none of them should be able
          to. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>Braunstein says that this
          case stands for the proposition that you
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">need not show</i> that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">nobody</i> can realize the
          benefit of the restriction. You only need to show that there�s at
          least one group that can�t realize the benefit.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Private nuisance</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What is a nuisance? It�s an invasion of property that isn�t a
          trespass. It�s a �<span class="SpellE">nontrespass</span> invasion of
          the property rights of another�. But why do we draw a distinction
          between trespass and nuisance? What
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">is</i> the distinction between
          the two? There are some annoyances that a landowner is expected to
          tolerate. But there are no
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">trespasses</i> that you�re
          expected to suffer. But you have to just deal with traffic and noisy
          neighbors as long as they�re not unreasonable. To get to the level of
          nuisance, it must be more annoying than merely somewhat annoying. But
          trespass is a violation per se. The laws with respect to nuisance deal
          with two neighbor�s correlative rights. When there�s a complaint,
          which neighbor is liable for injuring the other? It�s frequently,
          perhaps almost always, both neighbors that are causing the harm. One
          may insist on cleanliness while the other insists on having a dog
          kennel that they never clean. It�s like the Odd Couple! If they were
          both slobs, it would be fine, and if they were both neat, it would be
          fine, and if they weren�t
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">both there</i>, it would
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">also</i> be fine.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This is a place where contracts and torts come together in property
          law. Nuisance is a tort, but it�s also a lot like
          <span class="GramE">a servitude</span>. Nuisance says that I have the
          right to restrict what
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">you</i> can do on
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">your own land</i>. That�s the
          same as what a negative servitude does. When you have a covenant, you
          accomplish that restriction by contract. When there�s no contract, but
          the use of your land is unreasonable, the restriction can be imposed
          in tort.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The rule of nuisance is that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >you can�t use your land so as to unreasonably harm your neighbor</i
          >. But that doesn�t really tell you anything. It�s at best circular
          and maybe just doesn�t mean anything at all. It�s always a problem
          between two people, so it has to do with two competing uses being made
          of the land.</span

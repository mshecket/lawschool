<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span><a
href="piersonvpost.htm">Pierson v. Post</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is probably the most famous case in property law! Every law student in American has probably
read this case, or at least had it assigned.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It’s
been described in all kinds of ways, but the facts are straightforward. Post has the horses and dogs and trumpets and
stuff having a nice fox hunt. Pierson kills
the fox at the last minute. Post sues
him for trespass on the case. What does
that mean in this case? Why do we use
that form of action? It’s an action for damages,
and the harm is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>indirect</i>. There hasn’t been harm to the plaintiff’s
person or property.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is interesting: why doesn’t Post sue for trespass? Doesn’t he claim that he actually owned the
fox? If the fox had become his personal
property, then he should have used the trespass form of action.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
Post is chasing the fox on the beach. Is
this barren, uninhabited land, owned by no one? We treat it as such, and thus there are no rights of any landowner at
issue. If there was a landowner
involved, that landowner might claim that the fox belongs to him simply by
virtue of being on his property.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, however, all land is
owned. There is no land that is owned by
nobody. What about abandoning
property? You can’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>abandon</i> real property.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Who
does the majority find for? Pierson, the
shooter, wins! How does the court go
about its reasoning? What do they base
their decision on? They find that there
isn’t controlling American or British law.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Who
is Puffendorf, and what did he have to say? He’s some famous old dude from a very old book.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
majority and the dissent reason in very different ways. The majority relies on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>precedent</i> and reasons in a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>formal</i>
way, as opposed to an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>instrumental</i>
way. There are no cases and no statutes. Therefore, lacking law that compels a rule,
the court looks to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> for persuasive
authority. There isn’t any of that
either! So what the court finally has to
do is go to a third source of law: what have commentators on the law said? There aren’t any really current commentators! The court uses what is available and tries to
use them to resolve the basic issue in this case, which is: “What does it mean
to say that you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>possess</i> a fox?”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
underlies all this is “first in time, first in right”. The person who was first in possession of the
fox is the person who is entitled to the pelt.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
majority answers the question in a structured, formalistic way. So what does it mean to be in possession of
the fox? It means you kill it, mortally
wound it, or capture it physically. What
does mortal wounding and all that have to do with the facts of this case? Nothing really. This is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dicta</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>holding</i> of the case, which is the law
as applied to these particular facts before the court is that one obtains
possession of a wild animal by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>killing it</i>. But then there’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>dicta</i>, which are things the court says but that aren’t necessary to
come to a conclusion in the case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about Judge Livingston? How does he
reason? This is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>instrumental </i>reasoning. He
wants Post to win. How does he get to
that end? He talks about ancient
writers, but that’s not the thrust of his opinion.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>He
says that people invest in resources for killing foxes, and you want to create
public policy incentives to encourage more fox killing. People aren’t going to invest in killing
foxes if people can come along and take the fox at the last minute.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
we accept </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Livingston</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>’s premise that foxes are bad, and we should kill them. Pierson was the one who killed the fox. Can’t he be an adequate instrument for
killing foxes?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
we accept this is a sport. Then there is
a motive among the sportsmen to conserve foxes. Pierson, on the other hand, just wants to kill foxes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
is </span><st1:place><span>Livingston</span></st1:place><span> encouraging people to
do? Does he encourage people to kill
foxes, or to invest in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chasing</i> foxes?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
law is being used as an instrumentality and Braunstein thinks that it turns out
that the wrong instrument is chosen by </span><st1:place><span
 >Livingston</span></st1:place><span>. If </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:
 14.0pt;'>Livingston</span></st1:place><span>’s opinion had been adopted,
there would be more foxes than there are now.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
majority, on the other hand, is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mostly</i>
but not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entirely</i> formalistic in its
reasoning. It wants to promote the ends
of “peace and order in society”. Is the
majority opinion successful?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
majority opinion creates a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>direct
competition</i> to kill a fox. The one
who kills it gets possession and thus ownership. Let us accept that this will lead to more
certainty. But does it lead to peace and
order? Maybe not, because we have a
direct competition over a fox by people who are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>both armed</i>. Braunstein
suggests the possibility that this ruling will lead to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>exactly the opposite</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about </span><st1:place><span>Livingston</span></st1:place><span>? What is he encouraging? Would his decision lead to peace and order? Braunstein thinks so: what </span><st1:place><span
 >Livingston</span></st1:place><span> wants is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>polite hunting</i>. He wants to enforce the “rules of the
sportsman”. If you see someone in
pursuit, he would want you to back off and let them keep pursuing the fox.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
is a strong argument to be made for the majority in terms of certainty. </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:
 14.0pt;'>Livingston</span></st1:place><span> involves a lot of factual questions.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Braunstein
wants to persuade us that it’s not clear that the instrumental goals of either
the majority or minority will be successful.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span><a

American Energy Corporation v. Citizens Fidelity Bank &amp; Trust Company</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
gas that’s been returned to an underground reservoir personal property or real
property, and what does this have to do with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="piersonvpost.htm">Pierson</a></i>? We can see how the law moves by analogy: “Oil
and gas are like foxes, and thus we should apply the same law to oil and gas as
foxes. Whoever captures oil and gas owns
it.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
what happens if you catch a fox, but then it escapes? Then it becomes unowned again. One element of capture is that you must <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>maintain</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>control</i> (possession) in order to maintain ownership.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
was the earlier case of </span><st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
  normal'><span>Hammonds</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span>. Everybody agreed that once you put gas back
into the ground it became a “wild substance” again, like a fox on the
loose. This court overrules </span><st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Hammonds</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span>, or at least limits it. Gas is unlike a fox or a number of
reasons. Moreover, there is an important
public policy here. We want to get gas
out of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and up to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Kentucky</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> in order to heat people’s
homes in the winter. We want people to
be able to do this without destroying their possessory rights.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>You
can continue the wild animal analogy and say that the gas hasn’t been released,
but has been moved from one “cage” to another.</span></p>

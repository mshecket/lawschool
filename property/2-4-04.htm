          Crockers bought two lots in a subdivision. They cleared some brush off
          of some adjacent lots (to prevent fires) and tried to establish
          adverse possession. They also left some junk on the other lots. They
          want to claim that they have acquired these other three lots by
          adverse possession. They don�t have color of title.</span

      <p>

          It only matters that you believe that you possess the property
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in your own rights</i>. You
          possess the way an owner would possess. If you

          doing is adverse possession, you know �more than you need to�. It�s

          possession claim. The court finds it important to note that Mrs.

          Crockers lacked the intention to possess. Also, in order to file a

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This is very confusing. In some cases, all it means is that you�re
          claiming <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">unequivocally</i> that
          you have the right to possession in your own right. In other words,
          there is no requirement of good faith. But sometimes the courts go
          further than that and require that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">subjectively</i> you must
          believe that you have a right to be where you are. The adverse
          possessor, in other words, must show that they really believed it was
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">their land</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Some courts go even further and make it nearly impossible to acquire
          title by adverse possession. They say that you must be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">adverse</i>, have a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">claim of right</i>, but that
          you must be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">non-hostile</i> in
          the sense that you�re not thinking of the true owner. In other words,
          you must believe you have a right to be where you are yet

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> have the right to be
          where you are. This gets very close to a Catch-22 and makes it almost
          impossible to acquire land by adverse possession (AKA �title by
          larceny� among some of those who follow this rule). You would probably
          need color of title.</span

          adverse possessor. If, on the other hand, you�re out to reward a
          diligent adverse possessor, then you might start asking more or less

          Braunstein would set an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">objective</i> standard of
          whether the possessor
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">acted like</i> the true owner.

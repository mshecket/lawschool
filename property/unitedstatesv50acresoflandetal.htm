pp. 865-867</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The government instituted eminent
domain proceedings against a landfill belonging to the city of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Duncanville</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> as part of a flood control
project. The government argued that it
need only pay the ordinary fair market value of the land, while the city argued
that the government should pay that value plus the cost of acquiring and developing
a new landfill. In the trial court, the
jury found that the land was worth $225,000 and a reasonable substitute facility
was worth about $700,000. The District Court
entered a judgment for $225,000 plus interest. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, and the government appealed
to the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:
</span></b><span>Is just
compensation in this case properly measured by the cost of a reasonable substitute
landfill or by the fair market value of the condemned facility?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> Just compensation is
generally measured by fair market value.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The Court declines to make
an exception to the rule here. It was
not difficult to establish a fair market value for the condemned facility,
therefore it wasn’t necessary to substitute a different measure of just
compensation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court emphasizes that the language of the Constitution doesn’t limit just
compensation to strictly private condemnees but also to public entities at the
state and local level.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court also emphasizes that the standard for just compensation is objective, not
subjective, and doesn’t vary by whether the condemnee is a private owner or a
public entity.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The Court of Appeals is
reversed and the decision of the District Court is reinstated.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> Aztec bought some land that
it thought was located north of </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
  >Pocatello Creek Road</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span>. After checking it out, they realized that
they also bought a slice of property south of the road and a bit of the road
itself. Even though there wasn’t a
recorded easement for the road, Aztec realized that a public prescriptive right
of way had been created on the road. There is also a dead-end street that runs off </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
  >Pocatello Creek Road</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> called </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
  >Freeman Lane</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span>. Originally, it was built to provide access to
four houses. The easement for this road
doesn’t quite reach the main road; there is a gap of a few feet. Aztec admitted that the residents of the four
houses have a limited prescriptive easement across Aztec’s property. The dead end street was paved in 1973. In 1976, Creekside started developing a
200-unit apartment complex on </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
  >Freeman Lane</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span>. In 1977, Aztec sued Creekside for trespass
for greatly increasing the traffic across the disputed strip of land and
widening the road. The trial court held
that the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Freeman Lane</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> prescriptive easement was
public and that the widening and increased use of the road didn’t amount to a trespass.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Did the trial court
correctly find that Creekside’s actions did not constitute an actionable trespass?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> </span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> </span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The appellate court
reverses the trial court’s judgment and remands for the determination of damages
or equitable relief or both.</span></p>

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Whoa! This is a long case. But the facts aren�t complicated. Some
          neighbors are suing to prevent the expansion of a nearby cattle
          feedlot. The jury was instructed based on the First Restatement to
          balance the injury to the homeowners against the social value of the
          feedlot. The jury found that no nuisance existed. The homeowners
          appealed.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Was the jury properly instructed at trial as to what constitutes a
          nuisance under </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> law?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          NEW RULE! Damages may be awarded for nuisance even if that nuisance is
          caused by a �socially valuable� activity. The role of the law of
          nuisance is to internalize externalities.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court basically abandons existing state law which was based on the
          First Restatement and instead adopts the Second Restatement. The
          essential difference between the old rule and the new rule is that the
          �social value� of the source of the nuisance can excuse
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">all liability</i>. The social
          utility of an activity should be taken into consideration, but damages
          can still be awarded even if the nuisance is useful.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The judgment is vacated and a new trial is ordered.</span>

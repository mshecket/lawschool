This language is ambiguous. We could
interpret it generously as a fee simple determinable or fee simple subject to a
condition subsequent. Or we could
interpret it as a gift of an estate in fee simple absolute followed by a
promise without consideration. Or we
could interpret it as the two sides of a contract. [Braunstein says that Adele has a fee simple
absolute, but Oglethorpe may have some contract rights. Adele would also have contract obligations. But there’s some question whether the contract
is enforceable.]</span></p>

class=GramE>so</span> long as he remains in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>”: This is highly ambiguous
and problematic. The simplest thing for
a judge to do at common law might be to ignore the condition and say that this
grants Antonio a life estate because it doesn’t say “to Antonio and his heirs”. Oglethorpe would then have a reversion. On the other hand, the words “so long as”
generally indicate a fee simple determinable. If Antonio was granted a fee simple determinable, then Oglethorpe would
retain the possibility of reverter. But
the problem is just how to interpret the condition. Does it mean that Antonio must never set foot
outside of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>? Does it mean Antonio can never establish a

  >Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>? What if he’s buried in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

  >Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> ceases to be </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>? Anyway, I don’t think there’s any such thing
as a <span class=SpellE>delifeable</span> life estate. [Do we presume it’s a fee simple unless a
contrary intention appears? Braunstein
says that Oglethorpe’s estate could become possessory <span class=GramE>under</span>
two different conditions: either Antonio leaves </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> or dies. So Oglethorpe would seem to have both a reversion
and the possibility of reverter.]</span></p>

of the last example, except there’s no ambiguity as to the life estate. [There’s no life estate determinable in this
case. It must be a fee simple defeasible,
but the condition is ambiguous and poorly drafted. So Antonio has a fee simple determinable and
Oglethorpe has the possibility of reverter.]</span></p>

estate. Then, even though it’s not
explicit like it is with the first life estate, it must be the case that
Oglethorpe grants Belinda a vested remainder for life (if that’s the right way
to say it [it is]). “To Belinda” can’t
be interpreted as a vested remainder in fee simple absolute given what
follows. Finally, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

simple absolute. Oglethorpe gets a
reversion in fee simple absolute. [Notice that the words “but if Booker does not survive <span
class=SpellE>Anya</span>” don’t seem to have any independent force. If those words were not there, you’d get the

and her heirs so long as the land is farmed. After this conveyance, Oglethorpe transfers all of his property to his
son Bob. Oglethorpe then dies leaving a
will that transfers all of his property to the Humane Society. Oglethorpe is survived by his son Bob and his
wife <span class=SpellE>Corabeth</span>. Antoinette reads of Oglethorpe’s death in the newspaper and stops
farming. A week later, a troop of Girl
Scouts camping on the land suffers severe but nonfatal injuries due to a
landslide. They want to know who owns
the land so that they can file suit”: Oglethorpe grants Antoinette a fee simple
determinable. Oglethorpe retains the
possibility of reverter. Oglethorpe then
transfers the possibility of reverter to Bob. Bob still has the possibility of reverter at the time of Oglethorpe’s
death. When Antoinette stops farming,
the property automatically reverts to Bob. Therefore, Bob owns the land at the time of the landslide. [There’s an issue here! It depends on whether the possibility of
reverter is alienable or not! Before
1960, the possibility of reverter was not alienable <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>inter <span class=SpellE>vivos</span> </i>in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and thus Oglethorpe would
still have the possibility of reverter. So either Bob or the Humane Society would end up with the possibility of
reverter, or maybe the possibility of reverter isn’t devisable either. In that case, Bob and <span class=SpellE>Corabeth</span>
would be the heirs and would have the possibility of reverter. So Bob got the possibility of reverter if it
was alienated, the Humane Society got the possibility of reverter by will, or Bob
and <span class=SpellE>Corabeth</span> get the possibility of reverter by
inheritance.]</span></p>

<p><span>What
if I own some land and you want to buy it, but I don’t want any industrial
stuff on the land. I make you promise to
use the land for residential purposes only. But say you then sell it to some third party. Can that third party build a gas station on
that land? The third party is not in <span
class=SpellE>privity</span> of contract. One way to handle this is to use some determinable fee. But then the remedy in case of breach is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very severe</i>: you lose everything, and
all the property will revert to me!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
there are other ways to handle the same issue that we will cover when we do
equitable servitudes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
vested remainder is a property right even though it’s not a possessory
right. It can be sold, transferred, or
devised in a will.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
deed is effective when it’s delivered. A
will has no legal effect so long as the testator is alive.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Maybe
there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is </i>such a thing as a life
estate determinable! Yeah, there
is! That’s what Braunstein says. There could even be something like a fee tail
determinable. Yikes!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
could also be a lease subject to a condition subsequent! There could be a life estate subject to an
executory limitation! All kinds of crazy
crap!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>“Did
you take note of that? I don’t want you
coming back to me later and saying ‘you lied twice’.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>No
matter what language is used, the property interest that the grantor retains
will always be a reversionary interest.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are three ways to transfer property. You
can alienate it, you can devise it, or you can inherit it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>To
alienate property means to sell it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inter <span
class=SpellE>vivos</span></i>, while you’re alive. To devise property means to dispose of property
by will. If you inherit property, it
means you die without a will and it goes to your statutory heirs.</span></p>

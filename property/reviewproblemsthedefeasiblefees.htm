          simple subject to a condition subsequent. Or we could interpret it as
          a gift of an estate in fee simple absolute followed by a promise
          without consideration. Or we could interpret it as the two sides of a
          contract. [Braunstein says that Adele has a fee simple absolute, but
          Oglethorpe may have some contract rights. Adele would also have
          contract obligations. But there�s some question whether the contract

          >�Oglethorpe to Antonio so long as he remains in Missouri�: This is
          highly ambiguous and problematic. The simplest thing for a judge to do
          at common law might be to ignore the condition and say that this
          grants Antonio a life estate because it doesn�t say �to Antonio and
          his heirs�. Oglethorpe would then have a reversion. On the other hand,
          the words �so long as� generally indicate a fee simple determinable.
          If Antonio was granted a fee simple determinable, then Oglethorpe
          would retain the possibility of reverter. But the problem is just how
          to interpret the condition. Does it mean that Antonio must never set
          foot outside of Missouri? Does it mean Antonio can never establish a
          residence or domicile outside of Missouri? If Antonio dies, does he
          �remain� in Missouri? What if he�s buried in Missouri? What if his
          body doesn�t leave, but Missouri ceases to be Missouri? Anyway, I
          don�t think there�s any such thing as a delifeable life estate. [Do we
          presume it�s a fee simple unless a contrary intention appears?
          Braunstein says that Oglethorpe�s estate could become possessory under
          two different conditions: either Antonio leaves </span

          ><st1:place><span>Missouri</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>

          transfers all of his property to the Humane Society. Oglethorpe is
          survived by his son Bob and his wife Corabeth. Antoinette reads of
          Oglethorpe�s death in the newspaper and stops farming. A week later, a
          troop of Girl Scouts camping on the land suffers severe but nonfatal
          injuries due to a landslide. They want to know who owns the land so
          that they can file suit�: Oglethorpe grants Antoinette a fee simple
          determinable. Oglethorpe retains the possibility of reverter.
          Oglethorpe then transfers the possibility of reverter to Bob. Bob
          still has the possibility of reverter at the time of Oglethorpe�s
          death. When Antoinette stops farming, the property automatically
          reverts to Bob. Therefore, Bob owns the land at the time of the
          landslide. [There�s an issue here! It depends on whether the
          possibility of reverter is alienable or not! Before 1960, the
          possibility of reverter was not alienable

          and thus Oglethorpe would still have the possibility of reverter. So
          either Bob or the Humane Society would end up with the possibility of
          reverter, or maybe the possibility of reverter isn�t devisable either.
          In that case, Bob and Corabeth would be the heirs and would have the
          possibility of reverter. So Bob got the possibility of reverter if it
          was alienated, the Humane Society got the possibility of reverter by
          will, or Bob and Corabeth get the possibility of reverter by
          inheritance.]</span

        <span>The fee tail has been pretty much abolished everywhere.</span>

        <b><span>The fee tail in Ohio</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Let�s talk about </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place

          ></st1:State
        ><span
          >. The Ohio Rule Against Perpetuities says that �no interest in real
          or personal property shall be good unless it must vest, if at all, not
          later than twenty-one years after a life or lives in being at the
          creation of the interest.� This rule only applies to contingent
          remainders.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But the important part here is: �All estates given in tail, by deed
          or will, in lands or tenements lying within this state shall be and
          remain an absolute estate in fee simple to the issue of the first
          donee in tail.� So a gift that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">purports</i> to create a fee
          tail will create a life estate in the tenant-in-tail, and then a fee
          simple absolute in the issue of the tenant-in-tail, assuming that the
          tenant-in-tail has any issue. Compare (i) on page 137.<br

        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          >Another alternative is to abolish the fee tail altogether and say
          that �to A and the heirs of her body� equals �to A and her
          heirs�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Or you could get a life estate that converts into a fee simple
          absolute upon the birth of issue.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are a couple of reasons for these statutes. One is that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">fee tails last too long!</i>
          They prevent the property from being used in commerce during that
          period.</span

          the land in its natural state�? What about �To A for so long as the

          �during� and �so long as�. When the duration has run out, the estate

          ceremony. That�s not a coincidence! Marriage was once thought of
          essentially as a transfer of property rights. The habendum clause
          contains limitations on the estate granted. It usually follows the

          Life Saving Station�. Is this a fee simple determinable, or is this a
          fee simple subject to a condition subsequent? Is the reversion to the
          trustees automatic? According to the deed, it seems to be. It says
          that the land will go back to the trustees �without any legal
          proceedings, suit or otherwise�. That sounds pretty automatic. On the
          other hand, there is language that follows that says: �they shall be
          entitled to re-enter upon and take possession�. Is that latter
          language consistent with the fee simple determinable? It doesn�t sound
          like it. It sounds more like a fee simple subject to a condition
          subsequent because that is followed by right of entry, which is the
          future interest that this sounds like.</span

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          RTG bought some property in order to surface-mine some coal in eastern </span

          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. Some time later, the Ohio Department of Resources ruled that part
          of the land was unsuitable for mining because it interfered with an
          aquifer providing water to </span

          ><st1:PlaceType><span>City</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place
        ><span
          >. RTG filed a complaint the Tenth District Court of Appeals seeking a
          writ of mandamus. It looks like RTG got their writ, but somehow not
          the one they wanted and so they appealed to the Ohio Supreme
          Court.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the Ohio Reclamation Board of Review�s decision that
          <span class="SpellE">RTG�s</span> land was unsuitable for mining
          constitute a compensable taking?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          The rule of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="lucasvsouthcarolinacoastalcouncil.htm">Lucas</a></i
          >
          applies if there has been a 100% taking, while the rule of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="penncentraltransportationcompanyvcityofnewyork.htm"
              >Penn Central</a
            ></i
          >
          applies if the taking is less than 100%. The �percentage� will largely
          depend on how the court defines the denominator of the fraction.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court accepts <span class="SpellE">RTG�s</span> contention that
          the relevant parcel should be defined as only the coal rights and not
          the surface rights to their property. Furthermore, the court notes
          that coal rights are recognized as �separate property rights� in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. The court looks at what the relevant parcel was along both
          �horizontal� and �vertical� axes, and finds that the relevant parcel
          in this case coincides precisely with
          <span class="SpellE">RTG�s</span> coal rights. That means there has
          been a 100% taking, and the hard-edged,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">per se</i> rule of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="lucasvsouthcarolinacoastalcouncil.htm">Lucas</a></i
          >
          controls.
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="lucasvsouthcarolinacoastalcouncil.htm">Lucas</a></i
          >
          finds a compensable taking
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">except</i> when the activity
          being regulated is a nuisance. The court finds that coal mining is
          neither an �absolute� nor a �qualified� nuisance because it is a
          lawful activity. Therefore, the UFM designation constitutes a
          compensable taking.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and a writ of
          mandamus is issued to compel the state to pay for the value of the
          coal within the �unsuitable for mining� area.</span

          >The court held that there was no easement based on preexisting use
          because the use wasn�t apparent and because for at least some of the
          people they couldn�t show unity of ownership. But is there an easement
          by <span class="GramE">necessity, that</span> is, not contractual but
          based on public policy?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Easement by necessity</span></b
        ><span></span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Here are its characteristics: (1) unity of ownership prior to
          severance, (2) a necessity that existed at the time of severance, (3)
          the necessity is great, and (4) this easement lasts only as long as
          the necessity exists. The court finds that since the alternative route
          was reasonably adequate, there was no great necessity and thus no
          easement by necessity is implied. It might be that the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">best</i> way to get to the
          defendants� property is through the
          <span class="SpellE">Cordwell</span> property, but it�s not the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">only adequate</i> way to get
          there. But what if there had been an easement by necessity found? We
          want to make land productive, but we�re not going to force one party
          to give an easement to another without compensation. In many states,
          particularly Western states, they have something like private eminent
          domain statutes. They eliminate easement by necessity, but they create
          a process by which a neighbor can acquire a right of way and a cost is
          established for it. This probably had something to do with the �big
          barbeque� (?) where alternating parcels of land were given to the
          railroads and private parties. The private parties could get
          �land-locked� parcels and they would need a way to get in and
          out.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Where will we place the easement by necessity? How do we balance best
          access for the dominant party versus inconvenience to the servient
          party? It�s kind of muddy. There is a famous case in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Maine</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          where the only access to land was by sea. The court there said that a
          lot of land is like that in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Maine</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span>
          and that�s okay. But in most places, access by water only is not
          sufficient; you�ll be entitled to a road. It depends on the location
          of the land and what it�s used for. But
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">necessity </i>for the purposes
          of easement by necessity will usually let you get to a �land-locked�
          piece of land.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >These are a lot like adverse possession, though there are some
          differences. There is no statute that authorizes prescriptive
          easements. Therefore, courts have analogized to adverse possession,
          including the prescriptive time.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We have a row of <span class="SpellE">chickenhouses</span> and a road
          to the west of it that would be owned by the Sullivan but for adverse
          possession and prescriptive easement. The
          <span class="SpellE">Plettners</span> have been using the road for the
          prescriptive period. What did the
          <span class="SpellE">Plettners</span> do on the land they�re claiming?
          They planted trees and generally did the bare minimum. The fence put
          up by the <span class="SpellE">Sullivans</span> was located
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in the road</i>. But there was
          no fence before. The only activity in terms of adversely possessing
          the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">land </i>west of the road
          was planting trees. They acquire the ten-foot strip west of the road
          plus a prescriptive easement
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in</i> the road. But the only
          adverse use seems to be just planting the trees! I
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">guess</i> that�s sufficient.
          But why didn�t they acquire the road by adverse possession? They
          didn�t prove that they occupied the road to the exclusion of the
          Hatchery.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The main difference between adverse possession and prescriptive
          easements has to do with the requirement of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">exclusivity</i>, which is
          different for prescriptive easements than for adverse
          possession.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What other theory could the
          <span class="SpellE">Plettners</span> have argued? Did the Hatchery
          own both parcels at one point? Sure. The Hatchery sold half of the
          land to the <span class="SpellE">Plettners</span>,
          <span class="GramE">then</span> later sold the other half to the
          <span class="SpellE">Sullivans</span>. Couldn�t the
          <span class="SpellE">Plettners</span> have argued for an easement
          based on preexisting use? <span class="GramE">Could be.</span> The
          Hatchery used the road to access both parts of the land when they
          owned the whole thing.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s say that A owns a tract of land adjoining a public road. Let�s
          say that A sells the half of his lot that adjoins the public road to
          B. There has been a driveway that was used by A to get from the back
          lot to the public road. Compare this situation to a similar one except
          <span class="GramE">A</span> keeps the lot adjacent to the road and
          sells the outlying lot to B. Should there be any difference in the
          result in these cases? When A sells off the back lot that doesn�t
          touch the road and B claims a preexisting easement, what is it that B
          is claiming that he got as a result of the sale? He�ll claim that he
          got land plus an easement. A gave B a warranty deed. Does any of this
          breach any of the warranties in the deed? No, because when A says to B
          that B gets the back lot free of encumbrances, that�s true! A is
          giving B even more than what the deed states! On the other hand, if A
          keeps the back lot and B gets the lot adjacent to the road, we have an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">implied reservation</i>. A is
          reserving to himself something that is not contained in the deed to B.
          Does <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">this</i> breach the
          warranties of the deed or is it inconsistent with the warranties of
          the deed? Yes, because B is getting land that is encumbered by an
          easement. For this reason, some courts will not permit this situation,
          and other courts will say that you can have either an implied
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">grant</i> or an implied
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">reservation</i> to create an
          easement by preexisting use.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The views are changing! The latest Restatement of Property says that
          the two cases above should be treated the same. But most courts now
          would say that an implied reservation will require more necessity than
          an implied grant.</span

        ><span></span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Licenses can become irrevocable! The Camps owned a bunch of land and
          they wanted to build a lake on it. They contracted with Milam to build
          a lake, and in exchange they were supposed to give Milam some land.
          Milam also owned a corporation. The Camps executed a deed to the
          corporation in 1965, conveying 25 acres. We have no idea why it�s 25
          instead of 40. The deed referred to an agreement that had been
          executed prior to the deed. Here�s sort of a parol evidence rule deal:
          when there are earlier agreements and then a deed, the earlier
          agreements get merged into the deed and don�t have any further
          significance.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The <span class="SpellE">Milams</span> used the lake with the
          permission of the Camps. But then they got a motorboat and used the
          lake in a way that the Camps didn�t approve of. But what makes the
          license for the <span class="SpellE">Milams</span> irrevocable? There
          must be expenditures made by the licensee, contemplated by the
          licensor, and acted upon so as to greatly benefit the licensor. The
          licensor here is Camp. How is Camp benefited by the
          <span class="SpellE">Milams</span>� improvements? Camp is benefited by
          the dam built by the <span class="SpellE">Milams</span>. The court
          finds that this makes the license irrevocable! The
          <span class="SpellE">Milams</span> spent $50,000 or
          <span class="GramE">so on</span> the dam.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How long with the license last? This is more or less an easement now.
          It�s personal to the <span class="SpellE">Milams</span>. It will end
          when the <span class="SpellE">Milams</span> leave. It doesn�t run with
          the land and can�t be assigned or conveyed. They will never acquire an
          easement by prescription because it will always be permissive now.
          Does this make sense, even in the context of the case? Braunstein
          thinks that the case isn�t even internally consistent! We�ve already
          had one transfer, and it didn�t destroy the license. Why is it that a
          second transfer would do so? The court says that the license is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in gross</i>, personal to them,
          so when they leave, the license will end. That doesn�t make much
          sense! The First Restatement takes the position that the duration of
          an irrevocable license is measured by the length of time necessary to
          �reap the fruits of the expenditures�. In other words, the license
          lasts as long as the dam lasts. The
          <span class="SpellE">Milams</span> are being deprived of the value of
          alienating the land. If the parties had bothered to sit down and put
          their intentions in writing, things would have been a lot simpler.
          Once we start implying agreements for the use of real estate, we don�t
          know what their scope is or who is entitled to use it. We�re leaving
          the courts to try to figure it out.</span

          by William the Conqueror in 1066. William set up a feudal system. The
          word �fee� comes from the same root as the word �feudal�. A lot of the
          history, though, is �mostly made up�, according to Braunstein and
          others. The history is kind of revisionist. English lawyers in the
          16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century used this history to
          rationalize the very complex system of land titles that they had
          created. Inventing this history gives some credence to such a
          complicated system. But that�s the end of the history lesson.</span

          of statute or by A�s will. But if the heirs take anything, they�ll

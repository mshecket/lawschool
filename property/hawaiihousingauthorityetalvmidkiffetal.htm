<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Hawaii</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> legislature passed a law to
transfer land from large landowners to their lessees. The purpose was to end concentrated land
ownership in order to make the land market more efficient. When the HHA tried to take some land from
large landowners under this new law, the landowners sued, claiming the law was unconstitutional. The trial court held the law constitutional
because the goals of the law were “within the bounds of the State’s police
powers” and that the means of taking land was not “arbitrary, capricious, or
selected in bad faith”. The landowners appealed
and the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the law was unconstitutional
because it did not serve a legitimate “public use”, but rather was an unlawful
redistribution of private property from one person to another. The HHA appealed to the United States Supreme
Court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Is the Hawaii Land Reform
Act constitutional? More specifically,
are the “takings” authorized by the law consistent with a legitimate “public
use or purpose”?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> When the use of eminent
domain is “rationally related to a conceivable public purpose”, it will not be
found to be unconstitutional.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The Court finds that
breaking up the land oligopoly in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Hawaii</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> is a legitimate public
purpose and that the scheme devised by the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Hawaii</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> legislature to accomplish
this purpose is sufficiently related to the goal. The Court says that in general, it will not
insinuate itself into debates over the wisdom of various kinds of economic
regulation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The Supreme Court reverses
the decision of the Court of Appeals, finding the law constitutional.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>It seems like “public use”
suggests stuff that the public could actually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>use</i>, directly. For instance,
if you plow some houses to build a public park or a public highway or railroad
or sewage plant, that’s stuff the public can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>use</i>. But public purpose is
broader: if you condemn slums and then redevelop the area as new private
property for homes or businesses, it may not end up as something the public can
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>use</i>, but it may well serve the public
interest. In a sense, this is a
separation-of-powers issue. The question
is how much deference the courts should show to legislatures and where to draw
the constitutional line.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>The question is whether
courts shall review what legislatures <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do</i>,
or whether they shall simply make sure the legislature did <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>something</i> to make sure the takings of property were lawful. This Court seems to actually double-check
whether what the legislature did was okay.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>I think part of the point of
the limitation is to limit government interference in the land market. Furthermore, if you take someone’s property
against their will, even with just compensation, you will probably be reducing
the total utility of society unless that property is worth more to society at
large in different hands than it is to the previous private owner. Making sure there is a “public purpose” to
the taking will tend to reduce economically inefficient wealth transfers.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>It looks like a city council
wouldn’t have any big problems using eminent domain to get land for a shopping
mall. The public purpose would be to
encourage economic development of the area. The question is whether the new use of the land would be more
economically efficient than the old use of the land. It seems like it will take a lot for a court
to find that a government has gone too far.</span></p>

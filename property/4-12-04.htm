<p><span>We’re
going to do this class old-school style.</span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span><a
href="azteclimitedincvcreeksideinvestmentcompany.htm">Aztec Limited, Inc. v. <span
class=SpellE>Creekside</span> Investment Company</a></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Aztec
bought some property that was roughly a rectangle that stuck a little bit
across a public road. A dead-end street intersected
the public road. <span class=SpellE>Creekside</span>
bought some property on the dead-end street. Six feet of the road is in dispute! Apparently, this street wasn’t wide enough to accommodate the 200
residential units that <span class=SpellE>Creekside</span> was going to
build. They wanted to widen the part of
the road that they owned and the part that had been acquired by adverse
possession.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a hard case! What does Aztec have to
lose in this case? Aztec concedes the
prescriptive easement for the people who already live on the street. Let’s look at the situation solely in terms
of what the easement is worth to Aztec: what’s the six foot strip of land
worth? Why would you dispute that the
slice of land is worth nothing? Maybe
you could graze a very skinny cow there. Why does Aztec care? <span
class=GramE>It’s</span> six feet! They
didn’t even know that they owned it when they bought it! Maybe it’s just the principle of the
thing. Braunstein thinks that this case
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>just wrong</i>. It’s not legally wrong, but this isn’t how
people ought to behave! Aztec isn’t
losing anything except the opportunity to extort <span class=SpellE>Creekside</span>. Braunstein opines that this isn’t the way the
law really ought to be working!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court seems mad at <span class=SpellE>Creekside</span> and remands the case to
determine what punitive damages they might have to pay. But if Braunstein was sitting on the jury, he
would award the punitive damages against Aztec! This is beyond the scope of the discussion, but what we really have
going on is a “spite strip”. Developers
will often build roads and try to get their neighbors to contribute. Say A and B each own 100 acres and <span
class=GramE>A</span> wants to build a road to get to the public road. A asks B to help pay for it and B refuses,
thinking that A will build it anyway and B won’t have to pay. So A might build the road one foot over on A’s
property to force B to pay for an easement. A is more or less acting out of spite.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Perhaps
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> has a “private eminent domain” statute. Maybe that would have been the proper remedy
for <span class=SpellE>Creekside</span>. But it wouldn’t have mattered how this case was decided: <span
class=SpellE>Creekside</span> would get the right to the strip of land because
the parties would bargain for it. This
is a classic <span class=SpellE>Coase</span> Theorem situation. The assignment of rights doesn’t matter at
the level of society because the parties will negotiate between themselves to
divide up the property rights.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Now
for some more technical issues: <span class=SpellE>Creekside</span> wants to
argue that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>public</i> has acquired an
easement by prescription across the dead-end road. Why do they lose on that issue? Why isn’t there a public easement across the
six foot strip? What evidence supported
a public easement? There was some
evidence. The road was maintained by the
city, but it wasn’t used long enough to satisfy the prescriptive period. The city of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Pocatello</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> opened up the road to
public use.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
the second issue: does the use of the dead-end road by 200 residents constitute
a trespass (ignoring the increase in width issue)? Yes, but why? It is said that the burden on the servient estate is increased beyond
what was reasonably foreseeable beyond when the easement was granted. What if the easement had first been used for
horses and buggies, but now they want to drive cars on the road? Can they do so? The draft of the Restatement Third of Property
suggests that there should be a presumption in favor of modernization. Would this case be decided differently if the
court had adopted the Restatement Third? No, because there is an explicit proviso regarding “unreasonable damage
to the servient estate”. How is the
servient estate damaged? Why does it
make a difference how many cars cross the six feet? If the six feet can’t be used for anything,
then maybe you could find that Aztec couldn’t really be damaged, and thus that
the case could be decided differently.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
were four houses before. What if it had
been 40? Would the addition of 200
residences be a problem then? The court
says that an increase of a factor of ten is okay, but that an increase of a
factor of 50 is no good. There is no
bright line, though! If the change in
use of the dominant estate is foreseeable or doesn’t unreasonably interfere
with the use and enjoyment of the servient estate, then both in the language of
this court and the Restatement Third, then the use of the dominant estate can
be changed. But there is a point where
the use of the dominant estate could change <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>so
much</i> that it could become <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unreasonable</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if the public road was widened? That
would clearly be a trespass. The remedy
would be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at least</i> nominal damages for
the trespass and then maybe punitive damages as well. The only reason to give punitive damages to
Aztec is because they didn’t suffer any actual damages! Braunstein thinks that both sides should have
been reasonable and should have come to an agreement.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Any
time you have an implied easement based on prescription, preexisting use,
executed license, revocable license, or anything else, you have an exception to
the statute of frauds and you’ll also have problems with respect to the scope
of the easement. That’s because there is
no written evidence of what the parties’ intentions were. In all of these cases, we’ll have to struggle
to determine how the easement ought to be used: what uses are permissible and
what uses are not permissible.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Tract
Development Service, Inc. v. <span class=SpellE>Kepler</span></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
a little strip of land in dispute. Why
didn’t the reference to this “</span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
  >Diplomat Avenue</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span>” as “now abandoned” mean
that they weren’t conveying the easement? The deed kind of suggested that the benefit of the easement didn’t run
with the property. But the court says
that this isn’t the same as an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>express
exception to the easement</i>. It’s kind
of unclear! There is another abandonment
issue that will come up later. The court
says that these are public streets that had been platted and accepted by the
county supervisors. In order to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dedicate</i> a street to the public, it must
be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>accepted</i>. In other words, the county gets the benefit
of a street they didn’t have to build, but they also get the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>burden</i> of maintaining the street (like
snowplowing and such). But the streets
were platted in 1924 and the <span class=SpellE>Keplers</span> made their
purchase in 1988. The <span
class=SpellE>Keplers</span> didn’t want it as a public street anymore! The public easement in the street might be
over, but the court says that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>private</i>
easement isn’t over.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Was
the easement extinguished by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>merger</i>? The court says no. The rule is that if the dominant and servient
estates come under the same ownership, they merge, and thus the easement would
terminate. However, the court finds that
this isn’t applicable here because the dominant and servient estates didn’t <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all </i>come under the control of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one person</i>. It’s true that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>some</i> of the lots came into the ownership of one person, that doesn’t
matter. You would have to have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> of the lots in the subdivision come <span
class=GramE>under one ownership</span> in order to extinguish the
easement. This makes sense: imagine if
someone bought property on both sides of a public street. They can’t decide to end the easement and
shut down the street!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Was
the easement <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>abandoned</i>? No one has used this as a road for some time,
and they had planted trees there. That
seems pretty inconsistent with the use of the land as a road. What does the court say? They say that the trees could be removed in
the future and the road could be made a road again. But there must be an intention by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> the owners of the dominant estate to
abandon (compare this to merger). Non-use by itself is not enough. There also must be intent to abandon. Planting the trees is only evidence of the <span class=SpellE>Keplers</span>’
intent!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
there a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>prescriptive easement</i>? The <span class=SpellE>Keplers</span> put up
a fence, but the court claims that the fence wasn’t enough. The fence had an unlocked gate. The court takes this to mean that the <span
class=SpellE>Keplers</span> didn’t really try to keep people out. This is the biggest problem for the
court. The court could get around the
intent issue by saying that there must be intent to abandon by all holders of
the estate. But the court is working
hard not to disrupt the subdivision by shutting down the central street. Braunstein says that building a fence, even
with a gate, seems contrary to the notion of a public street. Recall what we said about fencing when we
talked about adverse possession: it shows intent to claim land and shows the
extent of the claim. In adverse
possession cases, you must prove exclusivity. In prescriptive easement cases, you don’t have to prove exclusivity to
create the easement, but you must prove exclusivity to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>terminate</i> the easement. Fencing is not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dispositive</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Exclusivity
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not required </i>to establish prescriptive
easement; you can share it with the owner of the land. But it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i>
required to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>terminate </i>a prescriptive
easement. When you terminate an
easement, you’re <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ending a use</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>There
was an adverse possession claim in this case. Why did it fail? Adverse
possession started to run in 1967, so there couldn’t possibly be adverse
possession. There was a claim that the
original deed to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> was invalid. If that had been true, the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> would have entered under
color of title and might have obtained adverse possession over the parcel. In this case, the owner granted the property
to the intended grantee. The grantor
could argue that the possession was not hostile.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
the key is that if we have a fee simple determinable, which is what the court
finds that we have here, adverse possession starts to run as soon as the
determining condition occurs. In this
case, that’s when the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> stopped using the land as a
lifesaving station. Compare that to the
next case.</span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span><a
href="higbeecorporationvkennedyexecutor.htm">Higbee Corporation v. Kennedy,
Executor</a></span></i></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<br/>

<p><span>Higbee
is kind of confusing. The deed is quite
old. There are two conditions: one is
that the grantee gets to use the property as a road for as long as he wishes
to, but on the other hand, the grantee agrees to construct and maintain a fence
on the property. The two conditions are
phrased somewhat differently. The
“provided” language attached to the “road” condition sounds like a fee simple
subject to a condition subsequent. However, the “forfeiture” language in regard to the “fence” condition
sounds like a fee simple determinable. In the end, it says that the land is to “revert to the party of the
first part”. That makes it look like a
fee simple determinable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
the court concludes that this is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent
based on a preference. The court kind of
throws up its hands and gives up. What’s
the difference in terms of the statute of limitations? If it’s a fee simple determinable, the
reversion to the grantor is automatic. If it’s a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, the grantor must
exercise some option to reclaim the property.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
what difference does that make to the statute of limitations? With the fee simple determinable, the statute
of limitations starts to run when the condition has been breached. But what about with the fee simple subject to
a condition subsequent? Is the
possession wrongful before the grantor or his heirs attempt to take possession? No way! The clock doesn’t start ticking until the grantor takes action to try to
get in and the grantee refuses entry.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Footnote
5 says that at common law these interests were not transferable. In fact, the possibility of reverter did not
become alienable in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> until the late 50’s or
early 60’s. That’s a fairly recent
development! The only way it could be
transferred prior to that was that it could be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>released</i>. In other words,
the grantor could release it to the grantee, who would then have a fee simple
absolute.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
we do the Rule Against Perpetuities, we’ll see why this is a big deal.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
was the intent of the grantor in this case? We haven’t the vaguest idea! Why
would you grant something to someone for “as long as they want to use it”? Why not just grant it to them? And what’s the deal with the fences? This is nutty, crazy!!! It’s futile to try to come back 100 years
later to ascribe some intention to the grantor.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>For
modern purposes, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nature of the
condition</i> will become more important to us.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>More on the future interests
of the defeasible fees</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
possibility of reverter, right of entry, and reversion are all vested
interests. That means that they are all
essential parts of the fee simple absolute. They are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>contingent. They are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>retained
parts</i> of the fee simple absolute, which was vested. Even if the owner transfers away a big chunk
of his fee simple absolute, the part that he keeps is still vested. Therefore, the rules we’ll look at next week
(like the Rule Against Perpetuities) don’t work to invalidate these interests. The point of those rules is to make land
marketable. We want to be able to put
the interests back together again so we can get the land into commerce.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Originally,
the possibility of reverter and right of entry were unlikely to be alienable or
devisable. In modern times, they are
generally alienable, devisable and inheritable.</span></p>

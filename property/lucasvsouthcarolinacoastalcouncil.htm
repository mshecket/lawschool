        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Lucas bought some beachfront property on an island for $975,000 in
          order to build a residential development. Two years later, the </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>South Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          legislature passed a law that made it illegal to develop the land
          Lucas bought. Lucas filed suit, claiming that the law constituted a
          taking of his property without just compensation. The trial court
          ruled his in favor and found that the new law deprived Lucas of 100%
          of the economic value of the land. The trial court ordered the Council
          to pay $1.2 million to Lucas. The Supreme Court of South Carolina
          reversed, basically saying that the statute served a valuable public
          purpose and therefore no compensation was required by the Fifth
          Amendment. Lucas appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the law�s effect on the economic value of Lucas�s land constitute
          a �taking� under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments requiring �just
          compensation�?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          NEW RULE! When the state deprives a property owner of 100% of the
          economic value of their land for some public purpose, it is a
          compensable taking unless the use that is being taken away was never
          part of the title to the land in the first place. For example, it�s
          not a taking to deprive the owner of the right to create a nuisance on
          their land, because that wasn�t part of their property rights
          anyway.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b

          The Court says that there are two clear-cut cases of regulatory

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This case falls into the latter category. The Court acknowledges that
          there are occasions when it will allow such regulation to fall short
          of a compensable taking. The only time that happens is if, in effect,
          the state takes away something the landowner never had in the first
          place.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >It is reasonable for property owners to expect that their property
          will be restricted in some ways. One way to look at this is to say
          that certain implied limitations �inhere� in the title to the land.
          The government doesn�t need to compensate for making
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">explicit </i>limitations that
          were previously
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">implicit</i>.</span

          nuisance and property forbid the intended use of the land.</span

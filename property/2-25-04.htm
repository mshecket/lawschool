          that seem to be complete alternatives? It�s kind of fictional, but on
          the other hand, there are ways that a life estate can end before the
          death of the life tenant. For example, the life tenant can decline the
          estate. In that case, the estate may go back to the grantor in fee

          history where the trend seems to be to allow people to tie up property
          for a number of generations. These rules are being abolished or being
          given much less significance than 50-60 years ago. One reason is that
          land is so much less important as a store of wealth in our society.
          We�re no longer an agrarian society. The principal stores of wealth
          are corporate. Land is an important store of wealth, but if land is
          not on the market, the economy is not going to be destroyed. So it�s
          getting easier to tie up land for a long time.</span

          executory interest that O tries to create in B. We would lop off the

          would become a fee simple absolute upon A�s death.</span

      <br />

      <p>

          Uses! You really had a problem! The common law couldn�t tolerate an

          is B is simply cut off and doesn�t exist if A dies before the
          condition is satisfied. In that case, O has a possessory fee simple
          absolute, has the whole bundle of sticks, and there�s nothing left for
          B.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">effect of the rule </i>is
          that contingent remainders are destroyed if the contingent

          recognized by the Statute of Uses in 1536.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s say we have the situation above, except A conveys his life
          estate to O. Before the Statute of Uses, the owner now has a fee
          simple absolute <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">by merger</i>.
          When O has the present possessory estate and the vested reversion, the
          intervening contingent remainder is wiped out. This rule
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">no longer serves any purpose</i
          >. After the Statute of Uses, the contingent remainder becomes valid
          as an executory interest and therefore there is no reason to destroy
          it.</span

          absolute to B�s children who survive A.�</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >First, we must classify the interests: A has a life estate and then
          B�s children have a contingent remainder in fee simple absolute.

      <p>
        <span
          >What if B dies leaving children, and then A dies? The contingent
          remainder becomes a vested remainder subject to open, then a vested
          remainder when B dies, and finally a possessory estate in fee simple
          absolute when A dies. No problem here!</span

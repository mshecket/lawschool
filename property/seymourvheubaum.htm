        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Effie Seymour granted all of her estate to a trustee for the benefit
          of her son William, with the remainder to go to William�s heirs. When
          William died, his will left all his property to his wife. The wife
          sued to have Effie�s will <span class="GramE">interpreted</span> such
          that she would have a fee simple devised by William. The widow wins at
          trial and the heirs of William other than William appeal.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Does the rule in Shelley�s case apply to Effie Seymour�s will, thus
          granting William, and in turn his widow, a fee simple absolute?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Whenever a freehold estate is granted to the ancestor and a remainder
          is granted to his heirs, the word �heirs� is taken to be a word of
          limitation rather than a word of purchase, and thus the ancestor
          acquires a fee simple interest in the estate. The rule operates when
          all three of these conditions are present:</span

          William�s widow will prevail if the rule applies. The defendants make

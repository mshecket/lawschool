absolute [it can’t be a remainder because it follows a vested fee simple].<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The problem is that Andy could die and his
heirs could be on the land for hundreds of years, farming, and then stop.<span

executory interest would turn possessory.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That violates the Rule <span class=GramE>Against</span>
Perpetuities!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So we have to reclassify,
and Andy has a fee simple determinable (it’s no longer subject to an executory
limitation…and it’s definitely not a fee simple subject to a condition
subsequent either) and Orville has a possibility of reverter.<span

good!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It looks like A just has a fee

</span>With the fee simple determinable, the farming condition is part of A’s
estate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you cut off the executory
interest, the condition is still part of it and A has the possibility of
reverter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, with the
fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, you have the condition about
farming being part of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>executory
interest</i>, so when that interest gets cut off, the condition does too.<span

is 89 and is married to Bella, his wife of 65 years [that’s a long time!], and
that they have three children”: First off, purportedly, <span class=SpellE>Arvid</span>
has a life estate, his widow has a contingent remainder for life (because it is
unascertained just who his widow will be or whether he’ll have one, like if he
gets divorced) and then a contingent remainder in fee simple absolute to his
children who survive whatever widow he leaves behind (they may or may not be
ascertained).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here we have the “unborn
widow” problem at common law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s say
Bella and all the children die, but <span class=SpellE>Arvid</span> remarries,
say to <span class=SpellE>Cruella</span>, who wasn’t born at the time of the
gift.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Arvid</span>
works as the validating life for the gift to <span class=SpellE>Cruella</span>.<span

(and thus both his widow and his children are ascertained at his death).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It may be more than 21 years before we know
whether <span class=SpellE>Donatello</span> will survive <span class=SpellE>Cruella</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, strangely enough, the gift to <span
class=SpellE>Cruella</span> (or Bella or any other potential widow) will be
okay, but the gift to <span class=SpellE>Arvid’s</span> children fails and thus
Orville keeps a reversion in fee simple absolute.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that the children in being at the time
of the gift don’t work as validating lives for anybody, either.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no life in being that will make this
gift valid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that this gift would
succeed if all the recipients of the gift were named.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Actually, all you would need to do is name <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the widow</i>.<span

has a life estate, the children have a contingent remainder in fee simple
absolute, and Orville has a reversion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

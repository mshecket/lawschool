          it is not farmed to Bonnie and her heirs�: Andy has a fee simple
          subject to an executory limitation [or a fee simple determinable, or
          maybe even a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent], and Bonnie
          has an executory interest in fee simple absolute [it can�t be a
          remainder because it follows a vested fee simple]. The problem is that
          Andy could die and his heirs could be on the land for hundreds of
          years, farming, and then stop. So it could be hundreds of years before
          the executory interest would turn possessory. That violates the Rule
          <span class="GramE">Against</span> Perpetuities! So we have to
          reclassify, and Andy has a fee simple determinable (it�s no longer
          subject to an executory limitation�and it�s definitely not a fee
          simple subject to a condition subsequent either) and Orville has a

          has a fee simple determinable and Orville has the possibility of
          reverter. The Rule <span class="GramE">Against</span> Perpetuities
          isn�t violated in this case. But what if the Orville sold the
          possibility of reverter to Bonnie? That�s why possibilities of
          reverter were difficult to sell. What if the gift was: �To A and her
          heirs, but if the land is not farmed to B and her heirs�? A has a fee
          simple subject to a condition <span class="GramE">subsequent,</span> B
          has an executory interest in fee simple absolute. But is the Rule
          <span class="GramE">Against</span> Perpetuities violated? Yes, because
          you could farm forever! It could fail to vest in B in 21 years.
          Therefore, the gift to B and her heirs is no good! It looks like A
          just has a fee simple absolute and O has nothing! That�s why we need
          to distinguish between fees simple determinable and fees simple
          subject to a condition subsequent. With the fee simple determinable,
          the farming condition is part of A�s estate. When you cut off the
          executory interest, the condition is still part of it and A has the
          possibility of reverter. On the other hand, with the fee simple
          subject to a condition subsequent, you have the condition about
          farming being part of the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">executory interest</i>, so when
          that interest gets cut off, the condition does too. These are
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">radically different results</i>

          (this remainder is contingent for two reasons: we don�t know who they

          okay, because the children will be ascertained when Adam dies. If Adam

          >��Orville to <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> for life, then to his
          widow, and then to his children who survive her.� Assume that
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> is 89 and is married to Bella, his
          wife of 65 years [that�s a long time!], and that they have three
          children�: First off, purportedly,
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> has a life estate, his widow has a
          contingent remainder for life (because it is unascertained just who
          his widow will be or whether he�ll have one, like if he gets divorced)
          and then a contingent remainder in fee simple absolute to his children
          who survive whatever widow he leaves behind (they may or may not be
          ascertained). Here we have the �unborn widow� problem at common law.
          Let�s say Bella and all the children die, but
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> remarries, say to
          <span class="SpellE">Cruella</span>, who wasn�t born at the time of
          the gift. <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> works as the validating
          life for the gift to <span class="SpellE">Cruella</span>.
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> and
          <span class="SpellE">Cruella</span> (miraculously) have a kid,
          <span class="SpellE">Donatello</span>. Then
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> dies (and thus both his widow and
          his children are ascertained at his death). It may be more than 21
          years before we know whether
          <span class="SpellE">Donatello</span> will survive
          <span class="SpellE">Cruella</span>. Therefore, strangely enough, the
          gift to <span class="SpellE">Cruella</span> (or Bella or any other
          potential widow) will be okay, but the gift to
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid�s</span> children fails and thus Orville
          keeps a reversion in fee simple absolute. Note that the children in
          being at the time of the gift don�t work as validating lives for
          anybody, either. There is no life in being that will make this gift
          valid. Note that this gift would succeed if all the recipients of the
          gift were named. Actually, all you would need to do is name
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">the widow</i>. So, in the end,
          <span class="SpellE">Arvid</span> has a life estate, the children have
          a contingent remainder in fee simple absolute, and Orville has a
          reversion.</span

          as the land is used for charitable purposes.� Subsequent to this
          conveyance, Orville conveys his property �to Binford and his heirs��:
          Initially, and purportedly, Alana has a fee simple determinable and
          Orville has the possibility of reverter. Then Orville sells what he
          has to Binford. It is quite uncertain whether the possibility of
          reverter can be sold or not (in other words, whether it�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">alienable</i>). If it can�t be,
          then things they as they are and no rules are violated. If it is sold,
          �the name stays the same� and Binford has the possibility of reverter.
          Is the possibility of reverter valid? Sure, because it�s vested right
          from the start and forever. The thing is, if these two conveyances
          were made in the same gift, then Alana would have had a fee simple
          determinable, also known as a fee simple subject to an executory
          limitation, and Binford would have had an executory interest. However,
          that executory interest would have been killed by the Rule
          <span class="GramE">Against</span> Perpetuities, because that interest
          could stay contingent way, way, way into the future and far beyond the
          deaths of both Alana and Binford. You never know how long the land
          will be used for charitable purposes! It could be hundreds of
          years!</span

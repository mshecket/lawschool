          Neither the majority nor the dissent deals with at least one important
          issue. If we say that this is a substantial property right that is a
          part of ownership, then why are we asking whether the loss of access

          the new curb cut to the existing preschool, but there�s a permanent

          on the notion that if there�s a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">substantial or unreasonable</i>
          interference to the right of access, it would be a taking. The

          The owners still have access to their property; it�s just that it�s
          not as convenient as it was before. Then we would argue that it�s not
          a take, but rather it�s regulation to promote public health, safety,
          and welfare. That means it�s no longer a per se taking, but it might
          still be a taking and we would have to use a multi-factor analysis. If

        <span
          >What was the covenant here? It�s a restrictive covenant that says the
          land must be used for residential purposes only, and no buildings may
          be erected other than single or double family dwellings. What do we
          mean by residential purposes? The court favors a definition of a place
          where �people reside or dwell�. It�s also not used for commercial or
          business purposes. It does include apartment buildings, and we think
          that it includes use as a home for mentally retarded persons. It�s
          also a non-profit purpose. In a way, it�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">close</i> to a business. It�s
          sort of almost like an educational institution. But the court doesn�t
          really discuss that.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The court says that this is a residential purpose. But is it a single
          family dwelling? It�s doesn�t have to be used for a single family
          residence. The property must be used for residential purposes, and
          nothing is to be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">constructed</i> on the property
          other than a single or double family dwelling. All this covenant is
          doing is regulating what can be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">built</i>, not what it can be
          used for.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So if you live in a subdivision with a covenant that says that you
          can only build a single family residence on it, and then a funeral
          home moves in and builds a funeral home that is designed like a
          single-family house. Does that mean you can build a funeral home in a
          subdivision where it says that you can only build �single-family
          dwellings�? Maybe you can build something that looks like a house and
          then use it for anything you want. Braunstein thinks it�s unlikely
          they would not allow this. The court would probably say that no matter
          how much they try to make it look like a house, it doesn�t look like a
          house. The court would figure out some way not to let funeral homes
          in. But there�s a difference between
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">use</i> requirements and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">construction</i> requirements.
          The court reads the covenant fairly narrowly so it doesn�t have to
          determine whether the people living in the house are a family.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The only difference between the two is that the horizontal privity of
          estate requirement is replaced with notice when it comes to equitable
          servitudes. Otherwise, both kinds of servitudes require: (1) intent to
          be bound, (2) touch and concern, (3) vertical privity of estate, and
          (4) formalities. Except for damages as opposed to injunction, there is
          no difference anymore between an equitable servitude and a real
          covenant because notice is a requirement for real covenants as well
          due to the Recording Acts.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Under the Recording Acts, if someone purchases property without
          notice of some restriction on the property, the third party purchaser
          without notice �takes� free of the restriction and is not bound by it.
          For example, A and B enter into a restrictive covenant that restricts
          B�s lot. If B sells to C, then the burden is binding on C
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">unless</i> C doesn�t have
          notice of the restriction. What this means in practice is that
          subsequent takers must have notice or they won�t be bound. The real
          covenant runs without notice,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">but</i>, because of the
          Recording Acts the good faith purchaser is protected from them. So
          real covenants require horizontal privity
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and</i> notice; equitable
          servitudes require
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">just notice</i>.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are three kinds of notice: (1) actual notice, (2) constructive
          notice, or (3) inquiry notice. Actual notice is when someone actually
          tells you that the land is restricted by some covenant. Constructive
          notice is fictional, and what we mean by that is that the information
          is contained in the public records. Whether you look at the records or
          not, you�re deemed to have notice of what�s in there. The third kind
          of notice is especially relevant in these kinds of cases: inquiry
          notice. If you have notice of certain facts that would make a
          reasonable person <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">curious</i>,
          then you�re deemed to know what a reasonable inquiry would reveal. You
          have a duty to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ask</i>. When
          we�re talking about residential subdivisions or office parks where
          there is an obvious plan of construction, you have a duty to ask
          whether there are restrictions on building there.</span

          wooden fence (a �spite fence�, Braunstein speculates). The fence
          affected the water flow across the property. Damages are awarded
          because it is found that the fence was built in such a way as to
          interfere with the free flow of water.</span

        <span
          >There was a guy named Imorde who sells one lot to Bishop, and then
          Imorde sells other lots to someone else. That person divides up the
          land into lots of little lots, including one to Rueff. Does the
          restriction between Imorde and Bishop apply to Rueff? The issue
          becomes whether Rueff had notice of the restrictions.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>Note that implied reciprocal
          servitudes seem to arise �at the drop of a hat� in </span

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s wrong with saying that Rueff had notice? This case is later
          overruled. If you want to impose servitudes on lots, you ought to file
          a plat of subdivision so that the restrictions are in the grantor�s
          chain of title. That way, all of the successors will have notice. In a
          regular title search, Rueff wouldn�t come across this particular
          covenant.</span

        <b><span>Termination of servitudes</span></b

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are lots of ways to end servitudes: (1) release, (2) merger,
          (3) abandonment, (4) estoppel, (5) waiver, (6) unclean hands, and (7)
          changed conditions. Estoppel is an equitable doctrine that applies
          only when you�re seeking an equitable remedy. It might end equitable
          servitudes but not real covenants. Unclean hands is the same: it won�t
          terminate real covenants. Unclean hands means that one who is seeking
          equity must do equity. If you violate a restrictive covenant, you
          can�t fairly sue someone else for doing the same thing. That doesn�t
          really terminate the servitude, but it means that the particular
          person suing to enforce the servitude will not be allowed to do it.
          The most important is changed conditions. Changed conditions is
          important because servitudes can last a very, very long time and it�s
          quite possible that they will become obsolete and incapable of
          accomplishing the purpose for which they were intended or that they
          become impractically expensive.</span

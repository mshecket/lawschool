      <p>
        <span
          >Say that A enters land in which B has a life estate and C has a
          remainder in fee simple absolute. Say A satisfies the requirements for
          adverse possession while B and C are both alive. Does A adversely
          possess just the life estate, or also the fee simple absolute
          remainder? This is a hard problem!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Has A done anything wrongful to C? A has only infringed upon the
          possessory interest of B. The wrongful entry is only wrongful as to B,
          and not to C. Therefore, A can only acquire a life estate (measured by
          B�s life). Furthermore, C cannot sue A because A is not infringing on
          C�s future interest.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Is there a way for A to distinguish C�s future interest? We�ll get
          back to this when we talk about the doctrine of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">waste</i>.</span

      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          ><br />
          What if A enters land owned by O, but then O dies and leaves a life
          estate to B plus a remainder in fee simple absolute to C? What does A
          get now? What�s the factual difference? O owns the property when A
          enters, and O owns a fee simple absolute. In this case, therefore, A
          wrongfully enters against someone who owns a fee simple absolute,
          whereas in the previous case, A wrongfully entered against someone who
          only owned a life estate.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So what does A get? What estate does A get in the land? The
          conveyance at O�s death to B does not interrupt adverse possession,
          and so A obtains a fee simple absolute.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The two main issues are: (1) Who are you possessing against? It can
          only be someone with a possessory interest. (2) When O divides the
          interest up at death into a life estate and a remainder in fee simple
          absolute, does that interrupt adverse possession? No, it
          doesn�t.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So what�s the rule? A acquires by adverse possession the estate of
          the person who was in possession when A wrongfully entered. So if the
          current possessor has a life estate, A gets a life estate. If the
          current possessor has a fee simple absolute, A gets a fee simple
          absolute, and so on.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" />

        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          >In the second case, if either B or C brought a lawsuit against A
          before the statute of limitations ran, either one could defeat adverse
          possession. C would bring the suit in his own name, but he would
          assert that he was acting on a right derived from O.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >You can�t adverse possession a future interest (except�waste? We�ll
          come back to this later).</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This is a common pool problem. Two people own an interest in the same
          land at the same time. Whenever you have a common pool problem,
          regulations are sure to follow to deal with the �tragedy of the
          commons�. If A�s possession would constitute waste, it would be a
          violation of C�s rights as well. If A wasted stuff for long enough, he
          could get adverse possession against C. But we�ll get back to this and
          clarify it later.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The point of this is not primarily to learn more about adverse
          possession, but rather to demonstrate the difference between
          possessory and non-possessory interests in land. The estate is a
          thing. You can only have adverse possession against a particular
          estate. If that estate ends, like a life estate deforms into a fee
          simple absolute, then the thing you possessed doesn�t exist
          anymore.</span

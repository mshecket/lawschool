          does is actually illegal, as in beyond their statutory authority.
          Absent some statutory restriction on the eminent domain power, pretty
          much anything is going to satisfy the �public purpose� requirement.
          It�s probably not worth the cost and expense of trying to litigate
          it.</span

          have to pay more than what the land is worth just to get the right to
          cross over a piece of land. These public utilities only have a limited
          power of eminent domain. But it�s necessary for them to have it.</span

          her argument? Has there been a taking of Mrs.
          <span class="SpellE">Loretto�s</span> property? If there has been one,
          it�s certainly been small. The Court concludes that this is a taking,

          money! The deal used to be that the landlord could charge either the
          cable company or the tenant for the right to wire up the building.
          This statute takes the money from the landlord and puts it in the

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court starts out with the metaphor that property is a �bundle of
          sticks��property isn�t just one right, but a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">series</i> of rights. Not just
          one �stick� has been taken in this case. Instead, the Court claims
          that this taking �slices� through the whole bundle.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court goes through and defines what this bundle of rights is.
          First, it�s the power to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">exclude</i>: an important part
          of ownership of which Mrs. Loretto has been denied in relation to the
          cable company. Next, there�s the power to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">possess</i>: to physically
          occupy and control the property that you own. The Court says that at
          least in a trivial way she has lost the power to control or to �use
          and enjoy� her property.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Then the Court says: �Clearly, one important �stick� in the bundle is
          the right to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">sell</i> (�alienate�) property.
          She still has the right to sell, but the value of the property has
          been eliminated
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">of all value</i>.� Braunstein
          thinks this is pretty weird. Installing cable service might actually
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">increase</i> the value of this
          property (<span class="GramE">it�s</span> �cable-ready�).</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Could Loretto sell her whole building? Sure, and the price wouldn�t
          be decreased by much at all, especially if cable is desirable for
          tenants. While she can�t charge the tenants for the cable service, the
          apartments themselves may become more valuable anyway because they�re
          �cable-ready�.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Has Mrs. Loretto lost value? To answer this question, you must ask
          �<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">compared to what?</i>�</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Note that if Mrs. Loretto gets out of the landlord business, she can
          rip out the cable at her pleasure.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Private individuals cannot trespass on your property. However, what
          we�re talking about here is the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">government</i> having the power
          to regulate. That�s the power that�s being exercised here. Loretto
          brings the lawsuit claiming that this power has been abused. Has the
          government just
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">regulated</i> what she can do
          with her land, or have they
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">deprived</i> her of her

      <p>
        <span

          the right to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">exclude</i>,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">control </i>(or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">use and enjoy</i>) and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">alienate</i> (sell). If we
          accept what the Court says, then Mrs. Loretto certainly has lost a
          property right in this case. Do we accept, however, that she has lost
          all these rights that the majority says she has?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The majority says that the difference between a permanent physical
          occupation and a regulation is that a permanent physical occupation is
          more severe. They say it�s more severe because there�s no control over
          the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">timing, extent </i>and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">nature</i> of the

      <br />

      <p>
        <span

          they force you to build them, that
          <span class="GramE">seems</span> pretty severe. But the majority says
          that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">any </i>permanent physical
          occupation is more severe than
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">any</i> regulation. Is this so
          convincing?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court also says that this rule has a low administrative cost. We
          know a permanent physical occupation when we see one. That makes it
          easy to enforce the rule. What�s more, we won�t inquire (initially) as
          to the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">extent</i> of the
          permanent physical occupation. The Fifth Amendment gets into play
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">whenever</i> there is the least
          permanent physical occupation. You still have to deal with the amount
          of just compensation, and at that point you�ll have to consider how
          serious the interference is.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The essence of property rules is that they can�t be taken from you
          from other individuals. However, they
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">can </i>be taken from you by
          the sovereign. The Fifth Amendment limits the sovereign�s power. The
          sovereign can <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">delegate </i>that
          power to another entity like the cable company,
          <span class="GramE">phone company</span> or power company. If the
          cable company was not granted this power, there would be no question
          that a trespass had occurred.</span

      <br />

      <p>

          But who is the third party? The first party is Mrs. Loretto, and the

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          A skating rink and a car dealer were located next to each other in
          what used to be a swamp. Before the skating rink was there, there was
          a miniature golf course, and there was no problem with water flow. But
          now the skating rink has a sloped roof that increased the flow towards
          the car dealer. The roof is a steeper pitch than the natural grade of
          the land. Cars got damaged! So the car lot built a big ol� wall to
          keep all the wall on the skating rink�s property. The next time there
          was a flood, all the water stayed on the skating rink�s side and the
          rink was damaged.

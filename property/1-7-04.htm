          equitable. Many argue that it is not equitable. One thing that the law

          and to recognize and protect private property. But you can�t have an
          efficient economy unless you start with an allocation of property
          rights. If people don�t know what they own, they have no incentive to
          try to invest in it because they might not have it tomorrow. You could

          stuff. The government can�t enter your property without good reason.

          it notarized and have it signed by witnesses. If the whole thing is in

          in all his land. He leaves the residue of his estate that Eva hasn�t
          consumed to Garland Pigg. It looks like Eva has the power to consume
          or dispose of the real and personal property. Then, whatever is not
          disposed of goes to </span

      <p>
        <span
          >What did the lower court find? There was a question of consideration
          for the agreement. The trial court found that the agreement was
          unenforceable for lack of consideration. That would mean that you go
          back and use the will. The reason there is no consideration, according
          to the trial court, is because </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Garland</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          didn�t give up anything because he didn�t really have any rights in
          the personal property. They reason that because Eva could have
          consumed or sold off all of Edward�s stuff before she died, there
          might not have been anything left for </span

      <p>
        <span
          >The court in this case talks about the relationship between Pigg and
          Edward Haley. Why is it relevant? They were distant relatives. But the
          lawyer for Pigg mustered all the evidence he could find to show a
          personal relationship between the two. The lawyer wants to make it
          seem reasonable and natural that Haley would want to provide for Pigg
          after his death.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if there had been no will? Mrs. Haley would have gotten
          everything because they had no children. Under the law of most states,
          the surviving spouse would inherit everything.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Who found the will? Mrs. Pigg found it while rooting around her
          husband�s things. The will was found among his genealogical notes. Was
          this really intended as a will? Braunstein thinks it�s an open
          question. When you really want something to be your will, you let
          people know. Maybe this will was just tentative. Maybe at one time he
          intended it to be final, but instead of tearing it up, he just put it
          aside. This document was not kept in a place that you would usually
          expect to store important papers. Mrs. Haley�s lawyer could have made
          the argument that this document was not intended to be a will at
          all.</span

          to the first taker, it rises to the level of a fee simple absolute.
          How would this case have been decided if the court had found that she
          had a fee simple absolute? If she has a fee simple absolute, Pigg
          can�t have a remainder under the will. If he doesn�t have a remainder
          under the will, then
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">there was no consideration</i>.

          But if she disposes of less than everything, there would be something
          left that would go to Pigg upon her death. How does she work with the
          statute to say that she wins anyway? She says that Pigg must prove
          that there will be something left upon her death, which she probably
          can�t do.</span

          remainder is worth, but it�s at least possible that it�s worth
          something. When he gives up the right to personal property, that

          power to dispose. There are several different views on the effect of

          the incentive is not so great. If they take care of the property, they
          have to pay the whole cost, but they may not get the whole benefit.
          Most of the benefit might go to the owner of the remainder. We have

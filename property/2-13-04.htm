          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">can</i> become possessory.
          There can�t be any gaps between the termination of the previous
          possessory estate and the remainder. The common law couldn�t tolerate
          the idea that ownership was in abeyance. �Who owns it in the meantime?
          It can�t be <span class="GramE">nobody</span>! There can�t be any

          A gets a life estate and B gets a remainder which becomes possessory
          on A�s death.</span

          <span class="GramE">A</span> <span class="SpellE">a</span> proper

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">after the person�s dead</i> to

<br/>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> During a period of high
unemployment, the city of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Detroit</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> plans to take a large tract
of land belonging to many different private owners and sell it to GM to build a
new plant. Landowners in the neighborhood
sued to stop the project and claimed, among other things, that the taking of
their land was unconstitutional under the Michigan Constitution. The plaintiffs lost at trial and moved for
immediate consideration by the Supreme Court of Michigan, which was granted.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:</span></b><span> Was eminent domain used to
take private property for private use contrary to the Michigan Constitution?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> The power of eminent domain
may not be invoked unless it is used for a "public use or purpose".</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> The court says that because
it is clear a private entity will benefit from this <span class=GramE>arrangement,</span>
a higher level of scrutiny is required to make sure that there is a "clear and
significant" public benefit. The court
believes that such a benefit has been demonstrated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
a strong dissent, Justice Ryan claims that this is a case of bad means being
justified by (maybe) good ends. Ryan
basically says that GM made a power move to extract what they wanted from the
city by threat of moving their plant to another state. Ryan sees this situation as a classic case of
appropriating private property for the private gain of another party.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Ryan
says that in prior cases, the standard of "public purpose" has been used for
taxation while "public use" has been used for eminent domain. Ryan says the different standards are
justified because eminent domain is far more intrusive than taxation and thus
the former should be scrutinized more closely.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The majority finds that the
taking of land is constitutional and upholds the trial court's decision.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>It doesn't look like
it. Judicial review of government land
grabs as authorized by legislatures is very limited both under the United
States Constitution and under the Michigan Constitution.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>This is a disaster. It's a huge wealth transfer from private
individuals, mostly poor, to a private corporation. I think it is entirely unjustifiable. It reminds me of a sports team holding a city
for ransom by threatening to move to another city. If they would make more money in another
city, they should just go there. In this
case, if GM would be more profitable by moving their plant to a <span
class=GramE>sunbelt</span> state, they should just go and do that. Another way to reduce unemployment in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Detroit</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> would be to have some
people move to another city where there are more jobs. It also would be very difficult to accurately
compensate people for the total cost of moving out of their homes. Some people have more of a sentimental
connection to the neighborhood than others, and ideally those people should be
compensated more. However, there would
be a great incentive for those without much of an emotional attachment to act
like they have more of an attachment in order to get more money. It is almost certain that the residents of
the neighborhood will be left <span class=SpellE>undercompensated</span>.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>This seems a little
hypocritical. If you really believe that
what the city or state or corporation are doing is wrong, I think you shouldn't
help them in the first place. If you
give them your legal services while really believing that they're wrong and
they actually win, it shows that either the system doesn't work, or you're wrong. If you're wrong, you shouldn't advocate
legislation that will change the (correct) result in the future. If the system doesn't work, then you were
wrong in the first place helping a bad policy win.</span></p>

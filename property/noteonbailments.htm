          >Irene�s best argument is that the bailment was for the sole benefit
          of Diana, and thus she was liable only for gross negligence. Irene
          would argue that this bailment is not a quid pro quo for Diana�s favor
          earlier in the summer. Irene would furthermore argue that the loss of
          the necklace was at most slight negligence because the box could have
          been stolen off of Diana�s desk just as well as it could have been
          stolen off of Irene�s desk. Also, Irene was never even aware of the
          box because she was out at lunch when it was delivered, transferred,
          and stolen. It is not reasonable to expect Irene to hover over Diana�s
          desk all the time to intercept any letters or boxes that may or may
          not appear important or valuable. Thus, she will argue, she is clearly
          not liable for this loss. As for the bond, Irene may concede that this
          would be an example of ordinary but not gross negligence, and thus she
          is not liable for that loss either.<br />
          <br />
          Diana should argue that the bailment was part of a course of conduct
          between the two women for their mutual benefit. She may claim that she
          held on to Irene�s stuff because she expected Irene to reciprocate.
          Thus, Irene would be responsible for the ordinary duty of care.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>Diana could then claim that
          even if the bailment is not for mutual benefit, Irene was grossly
          negligent in losing the bond. A reasonable person would know that a
          �certified-return receipt requested� letter is probably very important
          and needs to be handled especially carefully. Diana would not have as
          strong a case with the box. She might argue that Irene had a duty to
          put the rest of the office on notice that Diana�s letters and packages
          were to remain on Diana�s desk until Irene returned. This might have
          prevented the theft.</span

          >If Diana had paid Irene or had bought her a thank-you gift, it would
          help prove that the bailment was for mutual benefit rather than merely
          Diana�s benefit. A cash payment would make the bailment look more
          like, for example, a business transaction between a consumer and a
          storage company. This would seem to be more of a clear cut case of
          mutual benefit that would strengthen Diana�s arguments. On the other
          hand, giving a thank-you gift is arguably more in the nature of a
          friendly course of conduct between co-workers where each act is
          voluntary and gratuitous rather than understood as an exchange.</span

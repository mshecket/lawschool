        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Some guys built a quartz mill. They also agreed to chip in and build a
          dam and flume to provide water for the mill and to split the cost of
          maintaining the dam and flume. Two of the shares of ownership in the
          mill passed to the plaintiff and the defendant: the plaintiff got his
          by grant, and the defendant bought his at foreclosure. A few years
          later, the dam and flume were damaged and needed repairs. The
          plaintiff and defendant both had ownership interests in the mill at
          the time of the damage. The plaintiff told the defendant what had
          happened and suggested that they split the cost of the repair. The
          defendant agreed that the repairs should be made, and asked the
          plaintiff to take charge. The repairs were made and they cost $3500.
          The plaintiff sued the defendant for half of the cost of the repairs.
          The trial court found for the defendant.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Is the promise to maintain the dam and flume a covenant that runs with
          the land?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          To make a covenant run with the land, (1) the covenant must have
          something to do with the land, and (2) when the covenant imposes a
          burden on the land, there must be privity of estate between the
          parties making the covenant.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that the plaintiff and defendant were not in privity
          of estate at the time that the covenant was created. The defendant
          also didn�t have notice of any covenants running with the land when he
          bought the land at foreclosure. Finally, the court finds that there is
          no binding contractual obligation on the defendants that would survive
          the statute of frauds.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The trial court�s judgment is affirmed and the plaintiff gets
          nothing.</span

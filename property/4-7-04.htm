<p><b><span>Another problem</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
have L and T, and T assigns to T1. There
is also an assumption agreement between T and T1. Then T1 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>just</i>
assigns to T2. Then T2 assigns to T3. Who is liable to the landlord? I think that T1 is liable through privity of contract
because of the assumption agreement (the landlord is the third-party
beneficiary of that agreement). The tenant
is liable through privity of contract. What about T3 who currently has possession? Would there be privity of estate between T3
and the landlord? Yes! There’s a whole list of assignments. What about T2 who assigned to T3? Is there any privity of contract or privity
of estate? There is no privity of
contract because there is no assumption agreement. There is also no privity of estate once T2
has assigned his interest to T3. Of
course, T2 could be liable to T3. T1
will be liable for the rent that came due while he had privity of estate. T2 will be liable for the rent that came due
while <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>he</i> had privity of estate, and
the same with T3. But T1’s liability won’t
end with his privity of estate.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Just
what is a covenant? I don’t know because
I missed it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>An
assignment is as simple as saying: “I hereby assign my lease to you.” The lessee signs, and that’s the end of
it. The assignee doesn’t have to do
anything. In addition, the sublessee
could say: “I accept the assignment <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
promise to do X, Y, and Z.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>T
is always liable because T promised to pay the rent to L. Unless L lets him out of the contract, T is liable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Yet another problem</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>L
leases to T, T subleases to T1, then T1 assigns the sublease to T2. The rent doesn’t get paid, and L sues T and
wins. What rights does T have against T1
and T2? Is there an agreement in the
sublease whereby T1 promises to pay T? L
has no rights against either T1 or T2. That’s what it means to say that it’s a sublease. All that T1 assigned to T2 is the
sublease. So privity of estate and contract,
at least on the lease, is only between L and T. Under what other basis could T1 be liable if there’s no promise to pay
rent in the sublease? There may not be
privity of contract between T and T1, but there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>is</i> privity of estate between them. T has a reversion (by definition, because we’ve called this a
sublease). T1 owns interest in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>same property</i>. This is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>different</i>
privity of estate because it’s a different estate. Even if there is no contract, T1 has the
obligation to pay the rent based on privity of estate. If T1 assigns to T2, is T2 liable to the
original tenant? Yes! The privity of estate has <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>moved</i> from T1 to T2 when the assignment
happens. But both T1 and T2 are only liable
for the rent <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>while they were in privity
of estate</i> unless there’s a contract somewhere.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Don’t
forget, if the lessor retains a reversion, then it’s a sublease. If it were an assignment, the lessor would <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>assign</i> the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>entire term of the lease</i> to the lessee.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Julian v.
Christopher</span></i></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if the lease prohibits assignment or subletting without the landlord’s
consent? On what basis can the landlord
base his refusal? The reason must be
reasonable! This case acknowledges that
the common law rule is that the landlord can refuse to consent and be as
arbitrary as he pleases about it. However, the rule of this case, which is probably the trend, is that if
the lease is silent, the landlord must be reasonable. What’s the justification of the rule? Well, people should be reasonable. You have a right, especially once you look at
a lease as a contract, to expect that the party you’re contracting with will
act reasonably and in good faith.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
do we allow the landlord to be involved with the decision to transfer the
leasehold estate <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at all</i>? We don’t like restraints on alienation
generally. The landlord retains an interest
in the property, and has an interest in making sure the property is taken care
of properly. We give the landlord power
that we would not give in other sales. We give the landlord the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>power to approve</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
the landlord must be reasonable. What
does reasonable mean? What if the landlord
will not consent unless he is paid more money? Is that reasonable? What if the
assignee is charging more rent than what was originally agreed to between the landlord
and tenant? Should the landlord get
that? The case holds <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no</i>. The landlord wanted an extra $150 or so, and the case holds that this
isn’t reasonable.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
landlord doesn’t have to consent to assignment that will harm the interest of
other tenants. The landlord doesn’t have
to consent to waste. The landlord doesn’t
have to consent to assignment to a tenant with bad credit.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the contract says: “No assignment without the landlord’s consent”, can the tenant
sublease? Sure, because these agreements
are construed strictly against the landlord because of the policy of free
alienation. If you don’t want
assignments <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>or </i>subleases, you must
say <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
if the clause is “freely negotiated”, then the landlord is free to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unreasonably</i> withhold consent. Who has the bargaining power, though? Don’t tenants get leases on a
take-it-or-leave-it basis? How far will
this court really take this opinion? Will they decide that these are contracts of adhesion against public
policy? Most people don’t try to
negotiate their leases.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Servitudes</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are five types: (1) license, (2) easement, (3) profit, (4) real covenant, and
(5) equitable servitude.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
license is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>revocable permission</i>. Its key is that it is revocable. There is a big debate in the literature: what
if a license becomes irrevocable? Does
it become an easement, or is it simply an irrevocable license? Braunstein thinks they’re just synonymous.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>An
easement is the right to use the land of another for a limited purpose. It is not an estate in land, because it will
never become possessory. The most common
easement is a “right of way”, like if two neighbors share a common
driveway. Power companies also get
easements to run their power lines across property. There can be other types of easements as
well.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
profit is like an easement, but in addition to having the limited right to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>use</i> somebody’s property, you have the
right to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>take</i> something. Profits are not very important in modern
law. Sometimes they’ll crop up in
natural resources law, but other than that it’s usually the same as an
easement. The right to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>take</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>sever</i> something from the land plus the right to go on the land is
called a profit.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Real covenants</span></i><span> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>equitable servitudes</i> will be treated as synonymous, at least for
starters. Real covenants are covenants
that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>run with the land</i>. Successors to the land are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bound </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>benefited by</i> the covenant. Future owners of the land will be bound to perform the covenant even
though they didn’t enter into a contract to do it if the right circumstances
are met. The original example of this is
rent that “runs with” the lease. Courts
were originally very suspicious to real covenants because they clouded up the title
to land and affected the alienability of land. Today, these are seen as actually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>promoting</i>
the free alienability of land.</span></p>

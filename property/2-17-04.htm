        <span
          >We already talked about this to some extent. This estate is created
          by the words: �To A and the heirs of his body�. Those words don�t
          create a present interest in the �heirs of A�s body�, at least at
          common law. Those are just words of limitation.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The fee tail represents a �contest� between the older and younger
          generations. It�s sometimes called �dead hand control�. The older
          generation wants to tie up the land forever or for a long time, while
          the younger generation wants to be able to do whatever it wants with
          the property.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is also a contest going on between the government and
          individuals. The government wants to try to collect taxes in every
          generation. Prior to the income tax, estate taxes were much more
          important than they are now. The fee tail was a way to avoid the
          estate tax, at least as it was imposed in </span

          to A�s son and grandson and great-grandson, etc., didn�t count as
          taxable conveyances.</span

          lawyers trying to minimize them.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The other problem with the fee tail is that it ties the property up
          for a very long time. You can�t convey a fee simple absolute until A�s
          issue all die out! If you want to develop the property, they�re not
          going to buy it because all they can get is A�s interest. A�s interest
          will terminate on A�s death. The policy behind this is that property
          should be employed in commerce. That�s why the fee tail has been
          abolished in most states and severely limited in the others. Fee tails
          can always be converted into the fee simple absolute.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The fee tail was preceded by the fee simple conditional. This is
          another example of government and rich people and their attorneys
          fighting with each other. The owner of the fee simple conditional had
          the power to convey a fee simple absolute as soon as issue were born.

      <p>
        <span
          >The fee simple conditional was abolished by De Donis Conditionalibus
          in 1285. The younger generation wins for the time being by finding a
          way to convert the fee simple conditional into a fee simple absolute.
          Later, the older generation wins again by establishing the fee
          tail.</span

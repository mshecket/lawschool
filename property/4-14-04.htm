<p><span>We’re
not going to be able to do all of nuisance. We’ll do the private nuisance material and if we have time we’ll do the
material about water, which is short. But we wouldn’t be able to do the public nuisance stuff whether we had a
makeup class or not.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Implied covenants and the statute
of frauds</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Do
implied covenants violate the statute of frauds, and what did the court say in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a href="warrenvdetlefsen.htm">Warren v.
Detlefsen</a></i>? The court didn’t say
anything. But why not? We started out saying that covenants and
equitable servitudes are interests in land, and they must be written down to
satisfy the statute of frauds. But
implied covenants are not written down. So why is there apparently no statute of frauds problem? The statute of frauds doesn’t require the contract
be in writing, it only requires that some memorandum of the contract be in
writing. So maybe you can say that the restriction
in deed from </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Warren</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> to Detlefsen was enough of
a memorandum to satisfy the statute of frauds, even though the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>complete</i> agreement isn’t in the
memorandum. There are a few cases that
suggest that this doctrine <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> barred
by the statute of frauds. There is no
writing that suggests any restriction on the land retained by the grantor. The statute of frauds would then prevent
evidence from coming in that would go to prove that there was some implied contract
to the contrary.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Implied reciprocal negative
easements</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Warren</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> sells land to Detlefsen and then sells some
retained land to X, and then X wants to enforce the restriction against
Detlefsen? Is there any problem with
that? Can X sue D? Is there privity of estate? Is there a statute of frauds problem? Is the restriction that X is suing to enforce
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in writing</i>? Yes! It’s the promise that D made to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Warren</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. Now we’re saying that the promise runs with
the land and so X gets the benefit of the restriction. There is no statute of frauds problem at all! X is suing to enforce a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>written covenant</i>. X can
enforce an agreement to which he was not a party because of the doctrine of
covenants that run with the land.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Could
D enforce the restrictions in his earlier deed against X? Let’s say that </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Warren</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> doesn’t put any restriction
in the deed to X. So D sues X. There are no restrictions against X in
writing! It’s a different contract! The agreement between Warren and Detlefsen
only restricts what <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Detlefsen</i> can do
with his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>own</i> land. Now </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Warren</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> sells some of his remaining
land to someone else and doesn’t put in a restriction. But Detlefsen want to enforce a restriction
against X! Where does he get that
idea? It’s implied. We can say there is an implied burden on </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Warren</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> that runs with the land,
and the statute of frauds is not violated. This is the holding of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="warrenvdetlefsen.htm">Warren v. Detlefsen</a></i>. The restriction that D seeks to enforce is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> in a writing. In a state like </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>would</i> be a statute of frauds problem. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Arkansas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, for example, you can look
through the deeds that </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Warren</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> gave to prior purchasers
and see what restrictions were placed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Warren</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> sells the lot to X and restricts the use that X can
make of the lot? Let’s say </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Warren</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> says that X can only use
the land for a single-family residence. If X wants to sue D, it’s the same case as before because X is suing on
the restriction contained in Detlefsen’s deed. But what if Detlefsen wants to sue X? Can D win? If so, how? This is a written agreement between Warren
and X. Also, we could say that there was
an implied restriction on </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Warren</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s land that ran with the
land.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
what if we’re in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and we can’t rely on the
theory of implied reciprocal negative covenants? Well, there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>is</i> an agreement restricting X’s use of his land. But does that run to Detlefsen? Sure! Detlefsen
is a third-party beneficiary! The
covenant can’t run with the land because D isn’t acquiring any more land. We can construe this as a contract entered
into for the benefit for D and other prior purchasers. This is like what we talked about with
respect to assumption agreements. How
are you going to prove who the intended beneficiaries are, though? We’ll do the same thing that we do when we
implied the covenant, but we’ll do it for a different reason. We’ll look at the common plan or scheme of
development. Those people who are within
the common plan or scheme are the intended beneficiaries.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
we have a prior purchaser suing a subsequent purchaser and there are
restrictions in the subsequent purchaser’s deed, there are two theories
available to you. There is the theory of
implied reciprocal negative servitudes, and there is also the third-party
beneficiary agreement theory. But if
there isn’t an agreement between W and X, you lose on the third-party
beneficiary theory. It’s only when the
restrictions are contained in the subsequent deed that even though D isn’t a
party, he can claim that under the common scheme of development that he is a
third-party beneficiary. If all the
restrictions were the same, then we would imply what was in all the other
restrictions. But they’re not all the
same! Some of them deal with price, some
with square footage, and some with other stuff. The only thing that the court will imply is that the houses must be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>single family</i>. When we work with a theory of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implication</i>, one question is always: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>just what are we implying</i>?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The ancient lights problem,
p. 693</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
the doctrine of ancient lights? If you’ve
been getting light to your structure through windows or doors or air for some
period of time, your neighbor can’t build in such a way as to unreasonably
interfere with your access to light and air. The English standard was getting enough light so that a person of
ordinary eyesight can read. What you get
under this doctrine is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>prescriptive
easement</i>. If you satisfy the
doctrine (the building has been there long enough), you can acquired a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>negative easement by prescription</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>American
courts pretty much uniformly <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reject</i>
the doctrine, though. This doctrine
doesn’t say anything about protecting a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>scenic
view</i>. Also, solar collectors need <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>direct sunlight</i>. The doctrine that says you just need to be
able to read may suggest that you only need <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>indirect</i>
light. So this doctrine is probably <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>universally</i> rejected in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. The policy reason is that when these issues
began to arise in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> in the 19<sup>th</sup>
century, we were in a process of modernization. People were building apartments close to each other. The doctrine was seen as one that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>impeded development</i>. The courts and legislatures were trying to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>promote</i> the development of cities. Second, you can’t acquire a negative easement
by prescription. There must be a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>wrongful entry</i> that starts the statute
of limitations running. Just enjoying <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>looking</i> at someone’s land or collecting
the sunlight that flows over someone’s land is not a wrongful act. The statute of limitations never started to
run, and therefore it will never run out. In the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, you can <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i> acquire a negative easement by
prescription.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
a hotel in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Miami</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> called the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Fontainebleau</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. There’s another one that built an addition,
allegedly for blocking the sunlight to the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Fontainebleau</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s pool. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Fontainebleau</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> claimed that they had
acquired a prescriptive right to sunlight shining on the pool. The court wouldn’t recognize this right! What about an easement implied from
preexisting use? Sure! What would be the problems with that, though? What are the requirements for establishing an
easement from a preexisting use? There
must be common ownership: somebody would have had to have owned both pieces of
land at some point. Also, there must
have been a preexisting use that was continuous and apparent! How could it have been apparent that the property
was used that way? Even if all that is
satisfied, you must show some <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable
necessity</i>. Maybe we want to say that
promoting solar energy is a priority of public policy.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Could
there be an easement by necessity? You’ll
have a lot of the same problems: common ownership, showing that there was some <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>necessity</i> created when the parcels were
severed from each other, but then you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>also</i>
have to show necessity. The degree of
necessity is stronger here than when you’re talking about an easement based on
preexisting use. It seems to Braunstein
that the view is obviously not a necessity, but rather an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>amenity</i> at most. He also
thinks the solar collectors would fail to rise to the level of a necessity
under this standard. There may be
alternative sources of heat available. If that weren’t true, maybe you would have a chance, but that would be a
pretty tough fight.</span></p>

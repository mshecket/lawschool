          itself? The courts would say that that�s a question for the
          legislature. Some people may find that quite unsatisfying. The
          attitude of the courts is that if the legislature sees a public
          purpose that justifies the cost of eminent domain and that purpose is
          legitimate, then that�s enough. The court doesn�t ask this very good
          question. Absent a constitutional issue, we believe in legislative
          supremacy, which the courts interpret to mean that they must give
          great deference to legislative findings including the finding that
          giving the property to GM was better than keeping it the way it had
          been for a long time.</span

          property. It depends on how much land they own and what the needs of

          example. The government is only going to take a portion of the land
          and leave the remainder. But this may result in damage to the
          �residue�, or the land remaining. The remaining land may not be
          appropriate for all the valuable uses it could have been used for

          replacement housing in addition to everything listed above. In any

          this value is positive. That�s the value of the lease per rental
          period (per month or per year). Compare this to our apartment leases:
          given that our leases are short term, our rents are probably equal to

          grain elevator. They say that they just rent the land from the
          railroad, but they have sort of a symbiotic relationship with the

          <span class="SpellE">Almota</span> because they provide the wheat that
          fills the railroad�s cars and thus makes the railroad a profit. If

          lease, they would get paid not just for the seven years remaining
          times the value of the lease, but rather they would get paid more
          because the assignee could reasonably expect they would get the value
          of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">improvements</i> (the

          problem is that when you value property for the purposes of eminent

          valuation, and �substitute facility� might be the method you use. For
          example, if you gave property to the city for a park open to the
          public for free and then the federal government comes in and takes it
          for some reason, you might argue that there�s no market for property
          that you can�t use for any profitable purpose if the title stipulates
          that it must be used for a park that is open to the public with no
          fee.</span

        <span
          >The Court says that they are very reluctant to use the �substitute
          facilities� rule when a local jury judges a federal government which
          appears to them to have unlimited resources. The jury might become
          �<span class="SpellE">untethered</span>� from reality, as it
          were.</span

        <b><span>What we�ve been talking about so far</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What does it mean to own property vis-�-vis the government? Our
          conclusion is that we own property subject to the power of the
          sovereign to just <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">take</i> our
          property rights. Some things can just be taken. Some things can be
          taken but must be compensated. The point is that whether the
          government pays just compensation or not, your title is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >subservient to the state.</i
          ></span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
          ><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          >Now we�re going to go back to Chapter 1 and talk about some different
          ways to acquire title. How do you acquire title to a fox? How do you
          acquire title to something you find on a bus?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Don�t get bogged down in the details of this. The importance of the
          following material is what it means to own property vis-�-vis other
          individuals with claims to the property.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Then we�ll also see the law being used as an instrumentality. When we
          do the fox case, we�ll find that the courts didn�t like foxes and
          wanted to design the law in order to have as many foxes killed as
          possible. However, their design may have unintentionally led to the
          protection of foxes.</span

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Black siblings owned a farm. They signed a joint will saying that
          if any of them should die, the dead person�s property would be split
          among the surviving siblings. They also agreed that after all three of
          them died, their nieces and nephews would get everything �in fee�.
          After two of the siblings died, the third one, Jessie, wrote up new
          deeds conveying the farm to different people while reserving herself a
          life estate. Jessie filed a complaint asserting that she should now
          own everything in fee simple and that none of the nieces and nephews
          owned any interest in any of the property. The nieces and nephews
          counterclaimed to try to have the deeds declared null and void. The
          circuit court found that Jessie only had a life estate in the property
          and thus the deeds were no good. Jessie appealed.</span

          Has Jessie acquired fee simple title to the property in

          statutory and common law state that when an absolute �power of
          disposal� conflicts with some other limitation, the absolute power
          wins out. [Ed. This is wrong! I�ll fix it later!]</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The court finds that the joint will implicitly gives Jessie a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">life estate</i> and gives the
          nieces and nephews a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">remainder in fee simple</i
          >.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This will seems pretty clear on its face to me. Under any reasonable
          principles of interpretation, you would figure that there would be no
          reason to have �FIRST� and �SECOND� or two have two parts or the
          �however� if you really just wanted to leave all the property in fee
          to the last surviving person. It makes me wonder just what was going
          down in this case.</span

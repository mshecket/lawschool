        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Higbee filed an action to quiet title in a disputed tract of land.
          There was ambiguity in the original grant and it was unclear whether
          Kennedy owned a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to a
          condition subsequent. Higbee argued it was a fee simple determinable,
          and the trial court agreed. Kennedy appealed, claiming it was a fee
          simple subject to a condition subsequent.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Was the estate created by the deed a fee simple determinable or a fee
          simple subject to a condition subsequent?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Words that express conditions, like �provided�, �if�, and �upon the
          condition that� suggest the existence of a fee simple subject to a
          condition subsequent. However, the express retention of a reverter to
          the grantor suggests a fee simple determinable. Finally, the burden of
          clearly establishing a restriction on a grant falls on the drafter,
          and grants will be construed to make title as marketable as possible
          without being inconsistent with the grant.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The fee simple determinable is less marketable and alienable than the
          fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. The court places a high
          burden on the drafter of the grant to use clear language establishing
          the fee simple determinable. If it�s unclear, the court will rule that
          the grant is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent based on
          public policy grounds. The court thus finds that this grant was a fee
          simple subject to a condition subsequent.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Furthermore, the court finds that the condition subsequent has not
          been shown to have been broken. The word �wishes� suggests a
          subjective state of mind of the grantee. In order to show that the
          condition had been broken, the court says that Higbee would have to
          prove that Kennedy had �no inclination� to use the land for a road. It
          wasn�t enough merely to show that the land
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">wasn�t</i> being used as a
          road.</span

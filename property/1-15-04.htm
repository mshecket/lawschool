        <span
          >A lot of how you evaluate eminent domain cases, and particularly
          regulatory takings, depends on how you feel about government and
          whether government can be trusted to protect the institution of
          private property. Do we have to worry about the government going too
          far?</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Nollan owned some beachfront property. There was a little bungalow on
          the land, and the Nollans wanted to tear it down and build a
          single-family residence. They were going to make a much bigger
          structure. The government was concerned about a �wall� of residential
          properties creating a barrier to the view of the ocean. So, as a
          condition to get their permit, the government required them to provide
          an easement.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Where was the easement? You�ve got the ocean. The state owns the
          beach up to the �mean high tide� line. Then there�s the area between
          that line and the Nollans� wall. Then there�s the house, and then
          there�s a public highway.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The state wanted to condition the permit on granting an easement
          between the mean high tide line and the wall. It would be a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">different case </i>if the state
          required an easement from the public highway to the beach. (That�s
          what I thought this was!!!)</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >That�s the fact pattern. But what�s the public purpose here? You want
          people to be able to see the beach from the highway and know that it�s
          public. That�s a sufficient public purpose to justify regulation and
          taking by eminent domain. But the big question is: is this a
          compensable taking or just a regulation that adjusts the benefits and
          burdens of economic life in our society and doesn�t require
          compensation?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court starts with the proposition that if the California Coastal
          Commission had wanted to, they could have denied a building permit
          altogether. If they had done that, then there would have been no
          taking. If the state can do that, why can�t the state just put a
          condition on the building that says �If you want to build on this
          property, you must grant an easement that runs between the wall and
          the mean high tide line�?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are three main �sticks� in the bundle of property rights: the
          right to exclude, the right to use and enjoy, and the right to
          alienate. Which of these rights would be most affected by the actions
          of the California Coastal Commission? Arguably, it�s the right to
          exclude. You now have the public �intruding� on the landowners�
          property and being authorized to do so by the government. So this is a
          physical invasion, but is it permanent? You might argue that people
          won�t use the easement 24 hours a day, year-round. However, the Court
          is willing to assume, without discussion, that the invasion is
          permanent. They find it doesn�t have to be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">continuous</i> to be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">permanent.</i></span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So the landowners lose
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">primarily</i> their right to
          exclude, but secondarily the right to use and enjoy and a little bit
          of the right to alienate.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There seems to be a problem here. The majority admits that they could
          ban the construction altogether, which is more severe than what the
          state actually did. The state said: �You can build, and we�ll give you
          permission, but in return, you must allow the public to cross your
          land.� Why can�t they do that? Why can�t they condition their approval
          on this requirement?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why are they talking about ��fire� in a crowded theater�? Why does
          Scalia go off on this tangent? Why would it be unlawful to let people
          pay $100 to yell �fire� in a crowded theater when the state could just
          ban it altogether?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The justification for prohibiting people from yelling �fire� is
          public safety, and that allows you to prohibit it altogether. The
          justification for allowing the permitting process would be to raise
          money. There is an important public purpose that would allow you to
          prohibit the speech, but the permitting process doesn�t serve that
          same purpose. Therefore, it would be unconstitutional.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How does that apply to this case? Just because they can ban something
          doesn�t mean they can impose a condition that forces people to give up
          a constitutional right.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The government is restricted: if you have a constitutional right,
          like free speech, the government can�t impose
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">conditions</i> on the exercise
          of that right. Here, you have the constitutional right
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >not to have your property taken</i
          >
          except to a public purpose with just compensation. What the government
          is doing is imposing a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">condition</i> on that right:
          the Nollans must give up their constitutional right in order to get a
          building permit. Scalia says that this condition is unconstitutional.
          Just because the government has the right to do something more severe
          doesn�t mean the government has the right to do something less severe,
          that is, putting a condition on the exercise of a constitutional
          right.</span

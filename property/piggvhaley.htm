        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Mr. Haley died, leaving some uncertainty in his will. It was not clear
          what interest he left to his wife and what he left to his distant
          cousin, Mr. Pigg. Mrs. Haley and Mr. Pigg tried to cooperatively
          resolve the uncertainty by signing a written agreement that Mrs. Haley
          would get all of Mr. Haley�s personal property, while she would only
          get a life estate in his real property followed by a remainder for Mr.
          Pigg in fee simple absolute. Later, Mrs. Haley tried to sell some of
          the land to some of the other Haleys. All the Haleys sued Pigg,
          claiming �an equitable fee interest� in the land to be purchased and
          sold. The trial court found for the plaintiffs on the ground that the
          written agreement was void for lack of consideration.</span

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Was the agreement between Mrs. Haley and Mr. Pigg supported by
          adequate consideration?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          By statute, a conveyance is in fee simple absolute unless there is a
          contrary intention. By precedent, life estate plus absolute power of
          disposition equals fee simple absolute and any remainder is
          automatically void. But then, by statute again, life estate plus
          absolute power of disposition leaves a remainder in whatever the life
          tenant doesn�t sell or consume in his or her lifetime.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          Mrs. Haley argues that Pigg got nothing, while Pigg argues that the
          will left at least some remainder to him that could constitute valid
          consideration for the subsequent written agreement. The court agrees
          with Pigg and finds that he traded his remainder in for a remainder in
          the real property. The court also won�t declare the agreement void for
          mistake of law because the court says that the whole point of the
          agreement was to eliminate uncertainty about the effect of the law on
          the parties. Thus, the court holds that the agreement is valid and
          enforceable.</span

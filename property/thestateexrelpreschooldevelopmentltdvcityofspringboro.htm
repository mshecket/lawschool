        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          PDL has a preschool along Route 73. They had a curb cut so people
          could drive right into their lot. The city repaved the road and
          removed the curb cut so people could only get to the preschool by way
          of the adjacent drug store. PDL filed a complaint saying that
          eliminating the curb cut was a compensable taking under the </span
        ><st1:country-region
          ><st1:place><span>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region
        ><span>
          and Ohio Constitutions and asked for a writ of mandamus forcing the
          city to hold appropriation proceedings.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span> Was the elimination of the curb cut a �taking�?</span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          A property owner�s right of access to a public street cannot be
          �lawfully destroyed or unreasonably affected�.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          The majority finds that the elimination of the curb cut did not
          totally <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">destroy </i>nor
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">unreasonably </i>affect
          <span class="SpellE">PDL�s</span> access to Route 73. There was still
          access to PDL through the drug store parking lot, and the court found
          that this wasn�t an unreasonable inconvenience. The court may also
          have given weight to the fact that Springboro had previously told PDL
          that it would be safer to give customers access through the drug store
          in the first place (before the repaving).</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The dissent says that the majority relies on the wrong case. In
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">OTR</i>, the court found that a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">complete </i>denial of access
          to the property isn�t necessary to constitute a taking. That is, even
          if another way to access a property remains, the interference with an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">existing</i> property right is
          a taking.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The dissent also notes that this property may not be a preschool
          forever, and the loss of the curb cut could reduce the value of the
          property if it is later sold to another business for which direct
          access is more important.</span

        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span> The writ of mandamus is denied.</span>

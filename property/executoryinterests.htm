<br/>

<p><b><span>Executory Interests in
Contemporary Law</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
an executory interest is a future interest in someone other than the grantor
that’s not a reversion. One way you can have
an executory interest is when you have a fee simple subject to an executory
limitation. Another way is when you have
a vested remainder subject to divestment.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are two kinds of executory interests: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shifting
</i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>springing</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Shifting
executory interests go from one grantee to another upon the occurrence of some
condition.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Springing
executory interests go from the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>grantor</i>
to a grantee upon the occurrence of some condition. Another way to put it is that there is a
springing executory interest whenever there is an unavoidable gap in ownership
of a present possessory estate in the land. If the gap <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is </i>avoidable, then
you don’t call it a springing executory interest.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Executory Interests in the
Sixteenth Century</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Before
the Statute of Uses in 1536, shifting executory interests were not enforceable
at law but only in equity. In order to
make shifting executory interests enforceable, you had to use certain “magic
words” to “raise a use”. You also had to
appoint a “feoffee to uses” who was almost like a trustee.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>After
the Statute, the legal fee simple of the “feoffee to uses” disappeared as soon
as he got it.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Facts:</span></b><span> The Pennsylvania Coal
Company was going to mine some coal out from under </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Mahon</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s house, which would cause
the house to sink into the ground. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Mahon</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> sought an injunction
against the Coal Company to keep them from mining the coal under his
house. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Mahon</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> cited a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statute, the Kohler Act, which
forbids mining of coal if it would could a house to sink. The trial court ruled against an injunction,
saying that the Act was unconstitutional. The state supreme court, however, found that the Act was an appropriate
use of police power and gave the plaintiffs the injunction they wanted. The Coal Company appealed to the United
States Supreme Court.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Issue:
</span></b><span>Does the
state police power stretch so far as to allow the destruction of “previously
existing rights of property and contract”?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Rule:</span></b><span> In general, “if regulation
goes too far”, it will be considered a taking.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Analysis:</span></b><span> Holmes basically argues
that taking away the right to mine the coal by statute is more or less like
taking away the coal, period. He argues
that if you didn’t want to have your house sink, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Mahon</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> either shouldn’t have built
his house over a coal mine or should have purchased the land underneath the
coal along with the surface land. Generally, Holmes argues that the public good created by an eminent
domain taking must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>paid for</i>, and
so a regulatory taking must be paid for too.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
his dissent, Brandeis says that any government regulation, no matter how
minimal, will deprive a property owner of a right, but that doesn’t mean we’re
always going to compensate the owner. Brandeis says the government has the power to regulate the use of private
property in the interest of “public health, safety, or morals” without
compensating the owner.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Conclusion:</span></b><span> The decree of the state
supreme court is reversed.</span></p>

          That�s not the most complimentary description. The court intimates
          that it�s easier for the benefit to run than the burden. Courts used
          to be concerned that these covenants reduced the alienability of land.
          But Braunstein disagrees, pointing out that these covenants are very,
          very popular. If developers are acting rationally to maximize their
          profit then they think the land is worth more with the covenants than
          without them. But courts were concerned that any crazy thing you could
          contract for could become a real covenant and restrict the use of
          land.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >So why are courts more likely to enforce the benefit than the burden?
          Courts would say that benefits
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">increase</i> the alienability
          of land but burdens
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">decrease</i> the alienability
          of land. But the benefit is the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">reciprocal</i> of the burden.
          The benefit is not worth much if there is no one to enforce it
          against. These are often reciprocal promises, so we�ll often have to
          look at how the litigation comes up to find out whether it�s the
          benefit or the burden that�s running.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The most difficult concept here has to do with privity of estate.
          There are two kinds of privity of estate: �horizontal� and �vertical�.
          These terms are based solely on how law professors diagram these kinds
          of cases. Horizontal privity of estate exists between the original
          covenanting parties. Vertical privity of estate exists between one of
          the original parties and an assignee or successor.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The first form of horizontal privity of estate is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">tenurial</i>, or in other words
          the relationship of landlord and tenant. The second form is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">mutual</i>. That�s the
          situation where two people own an interest in the same land at the
          same time. They are said to be in privity of estate. The third form is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">simultaneous </i>or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">successive</i> privity of
          estate, where privity is entered into as a result of a transfer of an
          interest in land. So with the neighbors A and B mentioned above, there
          is no privity of estate and therefore no real covenant is created.
          Horizontal privity of estate has been largely eliminated in the </span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">usually</i> talking about the
          same estate. This is the same thing we saw in landlord-tenant law:
          there was privity of estate between the tenant and the assignee for
          promises to the landlord that the assignee didn�t himself make.</span

        <span
          >The first argument that is made is that the two agreements were
          really one because they were only made six days apart. What�s the
          purpose of that argument? If this argument were accepted, the
          plaintiff would be able to say that they were in simultaneous privity
          of estate. The court says, however, that at the time of the sale it
          hasn�t entered anyone�s mind to enter into this covenant. If they had
          intended at the time of the sale to enter into this covenant, that
          perhaps could have satisfied the successive privity of estate
          requirement. What�s the issue here? Is it the benefit that is running
          here, or is it the burden? It seems to be the benefit to Wheeler of
          having help in fixing up the mill. What if only the benefit was
          running? Would Wheeler have been able to enforce the agreement against
          Doescher�s group? Doescher hadn�t agreed with Wheeler to maintain the
          dam! You must have horizontal privity of estate in order for either
          the benefit or the burden to run, according to the court. It is said
          that even without privity of estate, benefit might run in cases where
          the burden doesn�t run. But the court says that we don�t need to get
          to that issue.</span

        <span
          >What about the Coke example regarding the �chappell�? There is
          privity of estate because D has given a freehold estate to the church.
          The chapel is a portion of the manor, and the court says that�s fine
          because it�s an example of mutual privity of estate because they both
          own an interest in the estate at the same time. But that has nothing
          to do with the relationship between Wheeler and Schad in this case.
          That�s what mutual privity of estate is all about. But the most likely
          privity of estate to exist is simultaneous or successive. What purpose
          does horizontal privity of estate serve? If we assume that if they had
          done the agreement five or six days earlier that it would have run,
          then all we�re left with is that successive privity of estate is
          basically a roadblock set up by courts to keep covenants from running
          because the courts distrusted them.</span

          subdivision that divides up land into parcels. Attached to the plat is
          a description of all of the restrictions on the land. If you buy the
          land, then you take subject to the restrictions. Another way to do
          this would be to transfer all the land to a straw and have the straw
          reconvey it with a deed containing all the restrictions and covenants.

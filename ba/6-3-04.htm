          >In the corporate world, starting after the Civil War, legislatures
          modernized the statutes in all four areas.� They provided a scheme
          (similar to what we see in R.C. 1701.69-91) that upon the appropriate
          stated shareholder vote there could be a dissolution, charter
          amendment, amalgamation (statutory merger), or a sale of all assets.�
          These changes were <i>sweeping</i>, and it set the base for the growth
          of the modern <i>big</i> corporation.� If you look at nearly any
          corporation�s history, you�ll find many mergers, etc. involved.� It�s
          a quite Darwinian process: corporation adapt to changing conditions
          (�the one part of Darwinism that is least controversial�).� In order
          to make these changes palatable to shareholders, the legislatures
          provided that many of these votes, if passed, would constitute such a
          change in the original business deal that it would be only fair to
          give
          <i>dissenting shareholders, voting �no�, a cash appraisal remedy</i>.�
          Legislatures have made the business corporation and the not-for-profit
          corporation very flexible and adaptable by having the foresight to
          allow these actions.� But with partnerships and LLCs, much of this
          flexibility is missing.</span

          over the cash in excess of liabilities, what the shareholders receive
          will again be subject to tax.� It�s a double tax!� But if the selling
          corporation is Sub S, then the double tax will shrink to a single tax
          because there will be no tax at the corporate level.� But it�s still a

          has had a corporate income tax since 1913.� Almost from the beginning,
          there have been certain provisions related to tax-free transactions:
          Internal Revenue Code � 351 (dealing with formation of a corporation)

          >This is an alternative to one company buying another.� What�s a
          statutory merger?� Consider the traditional Christian conception of
          marriage: �the two become one�.� There is a formal merger agreement
          approved by the board of directors of both companies, the shareholders
          of the acquired corporation, and, in most cases, the shareholders of
          the <i>acquiring</i> corporation.� The agreement says that the two
          corporations will become <i>one</i>.� That�s the �poetry�, but let�s
          consider the �prose�.� The statute says that all debts, obligations,
          and liabilities of the acquired corporation, �by operation of law�
          become debts, obligations, and liabilities of the acquiring
          corporation.� This applies to liabilities, whether known or unknown,
          whether contingent or not contingent, and whether contested or not
          contested.� A big Ohio Supreme Court case of the 1990s applied this
          language quite literally to a stock redemption agreement of the
          acquired corporation.� The question was: after the merger, could this
          be enforced against the acquiring corporation?� Yes!</span

          It�s very Draconian.� Careful lawyers had developed the habit by the
          1950�s, especially in tax-free transactions, of going on the asset
          purchase.� <i>Ferris v. Glen Alden</i>, decided by the Pennsylvania
          Supreme Court in the 1950�s, involved an amalgamation of two big NYSE
          companies.� The consideration was voting stock of the acquiring

          statute authorized the sale of all assets and statutory merger in a

          shareholders� suit was brought before the meeting on ultra vires
          grounds: this was a <i>de facto merger</i> in that the whole business
          of the acquired corporation was being taken over, stock was being
          issued, and there was a contractual assumption of all known,
          uncontested liabilities.� The paperwork that had to be submitted to
          shareholders differed in the two transactions.� In addition, if it
          were a mere sale of assets, there would be no shareholder appraisal

          your own stock and contractually assume the known, uncontested
          liabilities, it is also a de facto merger for liability purposes.�
          That is to say, you take over all of the liabilities of the acquired
          corporation, even those that were unknown, undisclosed, contingent,

          par.� Also, in a lot of foreign countries, the old understanding is
          still in place.� In modern usage, you can use no par stock, but you
          should never use it.� Also, don�t ever use high par stock except for
          preferred stock.� You should use $0.01 par stock for common stock,

          and many other states, if you use no par stock, the franchise tax is

          value, it�s computed on the par value of your stock and therefore if
          you�ve used $0.01 par or $0.0001 par, the franchise tax will be a lot

          indentures, some going back 70-80 years are tied to par value.� �It�s
          just too much history there!�� Also, occasionally, par value is very
          useful in that a high par value restricts the board of directors on

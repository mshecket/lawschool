<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Perlman v.
Feldmann</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a highly egalitarian decision that came as a big shock to the corporate
community. There were earlier cases
dealing with the sale of a control bloc to a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>looter</i>. The big case was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gerdes v. Reynolds</i> from the Supreme
Court of New York in the 1930’s. What
were the facts back in that case? There
was a liquid pool of money in the corporation. The corporation was managed, under contract, by an investment
company. The investment advisor had two
classes of stock: (1) the voting stock, and (2) non-voting stock. A purchaser appeared for the voting stock,
offering much more than liquidation value for the stock. The officers, directors, and controlling
person making the sale did <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i>
checking of the proposed purchaser, but not enough—they were negligent. The stock was sold. The purchaser took out the old board and put
in his guys, as you would expect. The
new guys looted the investment company! The
trustee in bankruptcy brought suit in state court against the controlling shareholder
and the officers and directors of the seller. It was held that the trustee in bankruptcy could get a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>double recovery</i>. He could recover jointly and severally the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>control premium</i> that the purchase paid
for the voting stock. Next, in ordinary negligence,
the trustee in bankruptcy could recover <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>from
the same group</i>. All jurisdictions
follow the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>looting cases</i>. Within the past twenty years, a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> decision has expressly
approved them.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Perlman</span></i><span> itself is a diversity case
in the Second Circuit under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Indiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law. The facts took place during the Korean
War. At time, especially during war,
wage and price controls are imposed by the federal government, and the Korean
War was one of those times. When those
controls are imposed, you get <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>startling</i>
results concerning the exemptions. In
both World War II and the Korean War, employee fringe benefits such as pension
and profit sharing plans as well as Blue Cross/Blue Shield were exempt from
wage and price controls. Furthermore, government
contractors making those payment were allowed to recoup them as cost from the federal
government. The federal government
treated those costs as legitimate. Out
of these wars sprouted employer-paid Blue Cross/Blue Shield and pension/profit-sharing
plans because during both periods companies needed every able-bodied worker
they could find and they could not raise the wage level to attract more
workers. They couldn’t raise wages, but
they could pay fringe benefits.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
same thing was true with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman </i>in
the Korean War. There were huge federal contracts
left for big companies like GM. All of
these contracts involved using a lot of steel. There was not enough steel to go around. The end users could not raise the price that they paid for steel, but
the price of stocks and bonds of corporations was not subject to the wage and
price controls. Therefore, if you were
an end user like GM and you were having trouble getting steel, you would get
together with another end user and try to buy mid-sized steel companies by
buying the controlling bloc of stock. The
end users who bought stock from the controlling family did not loot or
financially abuse the company. They paid
a fair price by the steel. We know it
was fair because it was set by central planners (ha ha). The case was brought originally as a shareholders’
derivative action, which would indicate that the plaintiff thought the recovery
ought to go into the corporate treasury.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the course of the Second Circuit opinion, we see a strange “mid-course
correction”: the opinion starts out by saying that “control is a corporate
asset” and that the controlling person has misused or misappropriated it for
himself. Then, towards the end of the
opinion, the court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>oozes</i> into the
remedy: they decide to share the control premium with the minority shareholders,
indicating that this right can be asserted either derivatively, as a duty owed
to the corporation (under FRCP Rule 23.1) or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>directly</i>, as a class action (Rule 23) on the basis of duties owed
to the minority shareholders themselves. The court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could have</i> cited a
case that we started the course with, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Speed
v. Transamerica</i>, for that exact proposition (and Shipman says they should
have). The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> cases expressly say that
the cause of action is AC/DC: it can be asserted either or both ways.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Since
this case, the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> courts have said that if
there is no looting and no fraud by the corporate shareholders, then the
controlling bloc of stock is his and it’s prerogative to get as much money as
he can. The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> rule is discussed in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wellman v. Dickinson </i>out of the Southern
District of New York. It is found in
F.Supp. from the 1960’s. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law is followed and
discussed. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Speed v. Transamerica</i> is the first case that says controlling shareholders
owe special duties <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> to the
company and to the minority shareholders. As the century goes back, we’ll get more egalitarian in most states.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, we have one of the leading
cases in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Brown v. Halbert</i>. It’s a
published opinion by the California Court of Appeals from the 1960’s. What were the facts? Mr. X owned about 80% of a prosperous stock
savings and loan in the 1970’s before the air went out of S &amp; L
stocks. Mr. Purchaser approached Mr. X
and said: “Merge your company into mine in a statutory merger, and I will pay
you and the minority shareholders a certain number of dollars per share.” A statutory merger or sale of all assets
tends to spread the control premium out over all shareholders on a per share
basis. Mr. X said: “No way! Can you make me another offer?” Mr. Purchaser says: “I think I see what you’re
driving at. I’ll buy your 80% at more
bucks per share and then we’ll work together to get the minority shareholders
to sell out at a lower price.” They did
so and didn’t inform the minority shareholders what had happened. Mr. X helped Mr. Purchaser get the minority
shares at a much smaller price per share. The California Court of Appeals holds that the control premium must be
spread out evenly for two reasons: (1) Mr. Purchaser had originally wanted to
tango in an egalitarian way that would have paid everyone the same per
share. (2) This was botched by Mr. X,
who additionally committed fraud in helping get Mr. Purchaser the rest of the
stock at a cheaper price. This case
cites <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i> with great
approval.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
next big </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> case was from the California Supreme Court: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ahmanson</i>. Mr. Ahmanson lived in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >San Diego</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. Sometime during the 1930’s, he started a
stock savings and loan. He was a
financial genius and the S &amp; L did very well. He owned about 80% of the S &amp; L. It was not publicly traded, and he wanted a
public market so that he and his controlling shareholder buddies transferred
their stock to Newco. That can be done
tax-free under Internal Revenue Code § 351. Newco then owned about 80% of the stock S &amp; L and Newco made an IPO
that made Mr. Ahmanson financially liquid as well as rich. Before this, he was rich, but his money was
tied up in the company. Meanwhile,
Ahmanson tried to pick up the minority stock with very lowball offers. The minority shareholders generally had
enough sense to reject him. They still
owned stock only in the S &amp; L but not Newco. However, the worth of the S &amp; L was now
in the public domain!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
suit was brought and it reached the California Supreme Court. They discuss <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perlman</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brown v. Halbert</i>. The cause of action could be asserted either
directly, derivatively, or both. Was it
a breach of the fiduciary duty to form the holding company and not let the minority
shareholders in on equal, per share terms? It was held that this was probably so, but the case was tried below
under an erroneous legal standard. The
case shall be sent back to the trial court, which will be told that the
controlling shareholder will win if he can show both of two things: (1) there
was a valid, bona fide business purpose for excluding the minority shareholders,
and (2) the purpose could not have been served by less drastic means. Of course, he couldn’t prove that. He died, and his estate settled the
suit. Here is where it gets interesting. For tax purposes, the Internal Revenue
Service often recognizes two important concepts: (1) minority discount, and (2)
control premium. Compute the value of
100% of the stock. Multiply the result
by the percent holdings of the minority shareholder. Apply to that figure a discount from 15-40% recognizing
the minority status.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> appraisal law, they have
said no to a minority discount on a closely-held minority stock interest. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the situation is
unclear. There are opinions indicating
that where it is a closely-held concern, if you elect appraisal rights, they
may apply that. If you buy 8% of a
company that is closely-held, then the regulations will be amended to say that
the stock will be redeemed when the buyer dies and to establish a fair market
value “without regard to minority discount”. Why do we put this in the regulations? There are </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> cases that indicate that
this may not happen unless you put this language in the regulations.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Internal Revenue Service was in dispute with the Ahmanson estate. He had the controlling bloc of Newco. Let’s say that Newco stock was selling at $45
per share. What does that mean? It is the value of an atomized 100 share bloc
having no real factor in control. That’s
why most tender offers are at well above the NYSE price. They say to Ahmanson’s estate that a control
premium will be added because he has such a big bloc. According to the newspapers, the statute of
limitations for a refund claim had not run, and they used this doctrine to get around
the control premium! There’s an
interconnection here between tax and finance (and “everything else”). Nobody knows what the current situation in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> is. Somebody buying will not pay a control
premium, with certain exceptions. They
fear that they may have to pay twice because of these doctrines.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Honigman v.
Green Giant</span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
is the Green Giant jolly? Green Giant is
a very old company, and the founding family took Class A stock that on a
share-for-share basis was just the same as Class B, except that Class A carried
1,000 votes per share as opposed to just one vote per share. Some call this kind of stock “founders’ stock”. If the company were liquidated, the Class A
stock held by the family would only get about 2-3%. However, they control. The family talked with investment bankers and
proposed this deal: call a shareholders’ meeting to amend the articles, under
which on a ten year basis we can exchange our Class A shares for Class B shares
and get our equity participation increased from 3% to 9%. In other words, they would be paid to be
egalitarian. This proposition was put to
the shareholders. The proxy statement
had full and fair disclosure. There was
overwhelming approval by the Class B holders. Mrs. Honigman was a shareholder in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Detroit</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> who didn’t like this. She went to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Milwaukee</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> to bring suit in federal court
in a diversity case. She argued that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i> gave her an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inalienable right</i> to stop this
transaction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court held “pish tosh”, there is no fraud, no damage to creditors, no waste, no
illegality, full and fair disclosure up-front, and an overwhelming majority
voting for it. Therefore, under the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> standard, with shareholder
blessing, Mrs. Honigman hasn’t a leg to stand on. She argued that control was a corporate asset
and it ought not be subjected to this kind of waiver. The court laughed at her argument. It is one of the most important cases ever
decided in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i>
chain.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, we have one provision that
you should pay close attention to: R.C. 1701.59(D) combined with .59(F). .59(D) generally says: as to duty of care
owed by directors to the company, you can’t hold them liable in money damages
unless the plaintiff proves recklessness or intentionality. We have noted before that .59(D) doesn’t
apply to purely prospective injunction relief. It also doesn’t apply to hardcore conflict of interest
transactions. But many companies today
will have a majority of independent, outside directors. On the other hand, R.C. 1701.59(F) says that
.59(D) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does not apply</i> to a
controlling person acting <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as a
controlling person</i>—the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tomash</i>
analysis. If a company is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>a public company and the independent
outside directors approve the transfer of a controlling bloc of stock to
somebody, then the shield of .59(D) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does
not apply </i>to that transaction. That’s
a very important section! If it’s a
public company, then that provision of .59(F) doesn’t apply.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are two other places where <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman v.
Feldmann</i> doesn’t apply. You have an
amalgamation. The acquiring company
enters into contracts with many of the controlling persons of the acquired
company. Does this violate conflict of
interest law? Does it violate <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i>? The answer is pretty well developed in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law: if the employment
contracts are reasonable and are fully and fairly disclosed up-front, there is
no problem with the transaction. Why is
this the correct resolution, according to Shipman? In an amalgamation, one of the first things
that the purchasing company wants to button down with either employment contracts
or covenants not to compete is that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>goodwill</i>
will transfer: the controlling persons won’t turn around and compete with you. The employment contracts or covenants not to
compete are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>crucial</i>. If you don’t get them, it can be legal
malpractice.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Next,
if you look through </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law of the last thirty
years, you’ll find that if there is a good reason for treating the controlling
person a little differently from others, it will be upheld if you can show
there is a sound reason for doing it and that it is reasonable and fully
disclosed up-front. Let’s say Smith owns
19% of X, Inc., which is an NYSE company. GM wants to amalgamate X, Inc. into itself in a statutory merger using
its own common stock as the consideration. GM wants to button the deal down as early as possible, and they talk to
Smith and the directors of X, Inc., saying: “Under R.C. Chapter 1704 and under
the poison pill, if the board of directors agrees to this, we can buy Smith’s
stock right now and we’ll buy it for our common stock using Rule 506. We agree that within seven months we will
cause X, Inc. to be merged into GM for GM common stock at the same rate that Smith
got the stock. If you research </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, you will find that’s
okay. There is no doubt that it’s okay under
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law. Both
sides of the transaction will be tax-free under Internal Revenue Code §
368(A)(1)(a). Generally, acquiring corporation
outside of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, they don’t want to chance
it and they will comply with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman</i>,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ahmanson</i>, and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Brown v. Halbert</i>. Note how
egalitarian these cases are.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Partnerships</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>We
will primarily be studying the <a href="uniformpartnershipact1914.htm">Uniform Partnership
Act of 1914</a>. The book has many
references to the Revised Uniform Partnership Act of the last 15 years. The Revised Act has notes that are very good
research tools; so does the original. In
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, our Act is close to the old one with one <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>maddening</i> change: the numbers in the
O.R.C. are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one off!</i> Partnerships and LLCs are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deep jello</i>. Your client can get screwed very, very
fast. We will make analogies to corporations,
which Shipman proposes are much more logical.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Just
what is a partnership? Read §§ 1-8 and
you get the picture. Partnership is
created when there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>co-ownership of a business
for profit</i>. If you’re in the
not-for-profit realm, look at R.C. Chapter 1702 and go to a not-for-profit corporation! Never use unincorporated business forms for a
not-for-profit association! On the other
hand, the definition of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>business</i> in
the cases is broad. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> cases in the last thirty
years have applied the statute to lottery tickets, for example. Jack says to Jill: “I’m going to buy some
lottery tickets with this number.” Jill
says: “Buy one for me too.” He buys two
$5 tickets, and they win! Jill, in most
states, can assert partnership law and get half of what those two tickets are
worth. In addition, in a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Mississippi</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> case after World War II, a
brother wanted to engage in a business operation. His sister sent him some money that looked
like a loan. The operation took off like
gangbusters, and it was held that the brother and sister were 50-50 partners
and the brother had to split with the sister. If there had been a big tort liability, the sister would have argued
that opposite: that she was a mere creditor.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Partnerships
come in two flavors: today and tomorrow we will discuss <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>advertent</i> partnerships. On
Wednesday, we’ll talk about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inadvertent</i>
partnerships. It is malpractice for a
lawyer to recommend a plain vanilla UPA general partnership today! Use the LLC or a corporation! But aren’t a lot of law firms set up as
LLPs? Those are general partnerships
with some limitation of tort liability but no limitation of tort liability. That’s just wrong and bad! They should be LLCs instead. But don’t worry unless you’re going to become
a partner. There is no such thing as an inadvertent
LLC or corporation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Richert v.
Handly</span></i></b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span></span></i></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></i></p>

<p><span>How
does the statute of frauds apply to partnerships? A famous </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Houston</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> lawyer got out of the issue
on the basis of the statute of frauds. If it involves real estate, here in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> we have strong partial
performance doctrines that may well override a lot of the authority other
places.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Assumed name statutes</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you are doing business under an assumed name, you are supposed to file an
assumed name certificate. As to a partnership,
the statute is especially demanding in that if you are a partnership and the
firm name contains less than all of the names of all of the partners, the
county recorder is not to accept real estate documents unless there is an
assumed name certificate filed. If the
firm name is Smith &amp; Jones and there is only Smith and only Jones, you’re
okay. But if you’re in Baker &amp;
Hostetler, there are a lot more partners than just Baker or Hostetler.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Partnership property</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Partnership
property can still be partnership property even if it’s in the name of one of
the partners. You don’t want to run a partnership
that way; you want to put partnership property in the partnership name. Before the Uniform Partnership Act of 1914, partnership
property had to be held in a cotenancy by partnership. The Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 says you
can clearly hold partnership property in the partnership name. Common name statutes in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and most states say that if
you’re suing a partnership simply to bind the partnership assets, the statute
will come to your aid if it’s not a very big deal. Likewise, a partnership can use the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> common name statute to sue
with just one signature: that of the managing partner. That’s true in most American states, though
it’s not so in three or four states. Do partnerships
ever issue stock certificates or anything similar? No, it’s the partnership agreement that
governs. There are no stock
certificates.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
have a Paul Bunyan at the bar, and a capitalist comes up. He just bought a timber-cutting
agreement. He says: “Let’s chop some
wood!” Bunyan asks: “How much timber is
there?” Bunyan looks, comes back and
says: “You’re 30% too high.” But they
agree anyhow, explicitly agreeing on a 50-50 profit split. They also explicitly agree that sweat equity
(Bunyan) was to use his tractor and other equipment. He was to be paid “above the line”, that is,
before computation of net loss, and he was to be reimbursed for the use of his
tractor. Nothing was said about interest
about capital, meaning that there shall be no interest on capital. Nothing was said about the partner’s salary.</span></p>

<p><span>Was
this agreement void because it was not in writing? No, because it was fully performed already. A general partnership was created. The timber was cut and sold. Each party had a capital account. The capital account goes up by the assets you
contribute and by your share of the net profits. It goes down by your share of the net
losses. This was a partnership for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one transaction</i>: the timber under the
timber lease. The tax return was
prepared by a CPA, who gave copies to both parties. The partnership agreement may be subject to
amendment by conduct, including how the tax return is prepared. Either partner can sign, but the others are
entitled to a copy of the return and a statement of their distributive share of
all items. The CPA computed the return
and found that overall there had been a loss and that the loss is allocable
50-50 between the partners. Clearly, the
profits were to be divided equally. The
CPA, in effect, said that there was a negative balance in the capital account
of Sweat Equity. The purpose of the partnership
was completed. There was a
dissolution. With a general partnership,
very often you have to use the traditional method of accounting to settle
up. There is a major Ohio Supreme Court
case from the 1980’s and a major </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Arizona</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> case from the 1970’s to the
contrary. Accounting is always <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in equity</i>. The partnership and all partners are
parties. Most often, the cost of the
accounting is borne by the partnership itself.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
was the problem? Bunyan thought that the
deal that had been cut was “profits: 50-50 and losses: 100-0”. Could that deal have explicitly been made as
between the parties up-front? Sure,
under § 18, which merely gives you default rules. If the parties <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>had</i> expressly so agreed up-front and there had been a tort liability,
would that bind the injured third party? Would it have bound contract creditors? No. Just read § 18 and you’ll see
that it will not bind those third parties. But if all creditors have been paid and there are no tort liabilities,
then this is merely between the parties. The Supreme Court holds that § 18 is clear: you agreed on the profit
ratio while your handshake agreement was silent on the loss ratio. In that situation, the loss ratio is the same
as the profit ratio. Bunyan isn’t
happy! But he does get a tax deduction. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the courts will usually
reach a different result. In some other
states, they might reach a different result if they can find <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no partnership</i>. If there’s a loss, and there is sweat equity,
in some states they will say that no partnership was formed. But this is the minority rule.</span></p>

<p><span>Many
law firms have a “draw” against profits. They set up a formula by which the partners can periodically draw out
about half of what the firm estimates will be the profits for the year. Note that if the draw against profits is
greater than what the profits turn out to be, the partner will get a note from
the senior partner asking for his check within ten days. If the draw is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>less</i>, as it usually is, within about two weeks after the end of the
year, the partner will get the difference from the firm. Cautious law firms never borrow money to pay partners’
draws. With one big law firm in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, there is no payment during
the year. They wait until January, and
then write a check. During the year, the
partners must write checks for estimated tax, and they’ll have no idea how much
to pay and no money to pay it with. Skadden Arps only distributes 83% in any year, though you pay tax on
100%. That’s because they want to build
up their internal finances. When you
retire, you have several million dollars in the capital account that you have
already paid taxes on. Don’t borrow
money for partners’ draws!</span></p>

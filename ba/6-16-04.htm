<p><b><span>Covenant to register</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Especially
in big Rule 506 transactions, there will be a covenant to register. For example, venture capitalists come in and
advance money under Rule 506 for stock. They usually won’t do it unless they think the company will have a
chance of going public down the road. They will require a covenant to register the stock that they purchased
under certain conditions. Usually, there
is not one, but two or three rounds of venture capital financing before a
company can go public. The contract to
register is a valid contract. Note this
practical limitation: if you’re a venture capital outfit and you’re investing
in a company and the contract to register is conditioned on the company “turning
the corner” and starting to make money, you still have to find an investment
banker interested in such transactions.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
addition, if it is agreed that the company will go public, the underwriters
will not let the venture capitalists sell over one-half. This is a matter of merchandising. If the venture capitalists want to sell more
than that, it looks like a bailout and the offering won’t take. The underwriter will require signatures for a
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lock-up period</i>, usually nine months, from
the venture capital types and the twenty top employees holding the most options. One of the prospectus items will be the Rule
144 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overhang</i>. The underwriter wants nine months during
which the insiders will not cash in. At
the end of nine months, when Rule 144 will be fully effective as to people who
have held the stock for a year or more and as to non-executives who want to sell,
the market price of the stock will go down an average of 8%. It’s a risky business to take a company
public, but it can also make you a lot of money! Underwriting fees can approach 6%. There are also attorneys’ fees and auditors’
fees that will run the total cost up to 9%.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>None
of Regulation D itself deals with affiliates. Also, if a company is public, Rule 144 has a volume limit. Say you have a situation where Smith owns 80%
of X, Inc., a closely held company. GM
or some other big company comes along and wants to buy X, either for cash or
stock (which would be tax-free). Can
Smith, an affiliate, sell to GM? Smith
can’t use Rule 144 because, among other things, Rule 144 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>never</i> applies to a company that is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>never</i> public. He can’t use §
4(2) because that is limited to the actual <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>issuer</i>. Smith can use § 4(1) plus § 2(11): when you
put them together, the controlling person can, in this situation, sell to GM so
long as it is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-distribution</i>. <span class=GramE>The first sentence of §
2(11) talks about distribution.</span> If something is a non-distribution, then when you put § 2(11) together
with § 4(1), you have an exemption. This
will be a non-distribution if Smith meets the test of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Ralston Purina</i>: (1) there is full and fair disclosure up front, (2)
the purchaser can fend for himself, (3) the stock is <span class=SpellE>legended</span>
and there is an investment letter, and (4) GM is given <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>access</i> to Smith and all top executives. So, there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does</i>
exist a § 4(1) exemption under this situation. It’s a bit trickier than using Rule 506, but if you’re careful it can be
done.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Close corporations</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Today,
we’re mainly talking about corporate norms and the power of shareholders.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Corporate norms – <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McQuade</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. </i></span></b><st1:City><st1:place><b
 ><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
 >Stoneham</span></i></b></st1:place></st1:City><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Stoneham</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> owned the majority stock of
the New York Giants, and McGraw was his manager in the 1920’s. McGraw was also a minority shareholder in the
Giants <span class=GramE>corporation</span>. These two basically ran the team and the business. There were about 7-8 other minority shareholders. <span class=SpellE>McQuade</span>, a state court
judge, somehow got to know McGraw and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Stoneham</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. McGraw and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Stoneham</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> asked <span class=SpellE>McQuade</span>
to buy some stock in the corporation to the tune of around $100,000. They invited him to be an officer of the
company. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Stoneham</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> didn’t call a corporate
lawyer! <span class=SpellE>McQuade</span>
negotiated with McGraw and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Stoneham</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> and entered into a contract
with him in their personal capacities. First off, there was a shareholder voting agreement for a short term
whereby the two sellers agreed to vote their stock to elect </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Stoneham</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> as a director. The agreement was in writing and was
short-term. It was signed. There was no bad intent, and all courts
upheld this first, limited shareholders’ voting agreement. Shareholder voting agreements that are
limited, reasonable, in writing and signed can be valid even if they don’t meet
the standards of R.C. 1701.591 because the courts encourage such agreements. In the second agreement, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Stoneham</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> and McGraw, as directors,
agreed that they would keep <span class=SpellE>McQuade</span> as an officer of
the corporation for a reasonable length of years.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
stock changed hands. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span class=SpellE>McQuade</span>
paid the money and took over as treasurer. He performed well. One day, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Stoneham</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> called him in and said: “You’re
fired!” <span class=SpellE>McQuade</span>
sues. The first count is that he wants
an injunction for reinstatement. The
second count is that if he can’t get reinstatement, he wants monetary damages. The trial court did not grant
reinstatement. The trial court thought
that the agreement was valid, but in those days you couldn’t get affirmative
injunctive relief to keep a job because the feeling was that you always had a
damage remedy that was adequate at law. That’s a correct statement of the law as of 1921.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
the exceptions have grown. The first
exception is found in civil service statutes: if you have a civil service
protection with government and you are wrongfully removed without cause, you
can go into court and get an affirmative injunctive order for
reinstatement. The second exception
comes in the 1930’s with federal labor legislation: if you were fired in
violation of the union contract or federal labor laws, you, or the union on
your behalf, could go into court and get affirmative injunctive relief for a
wrongful discharge. The third exception
was tenure in educational institutions, which has grown over the last ninety
years. If you have tenure and are
dismissed, you can go to court and get reinstated. The fourth exception is found in state and federal
equal employment statutes from the 1960’s and 1970’s. You can sue for reinstatement. Most plaintiffs will opt for money damages,
though, because you don’t want to go back to a job where they don’t want you. The fifth exception is that if you’re
wrongfully dismissed from state employment in violation of state union laws,
you and your union can get you reinstated. But people will often choose damages instead.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Lastly,
there are two “new kids on the block”. Arbitrators
can grant remedies that courts cannot unless the arbitration agreement states
to the contrary. In <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Staklinski</i></span>, from the Court of
Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, a close corporation formed
an agreement with a top executive for employment for a term. The agreement was in writing and signed. After a year or two, the company thought the employee
had a disability such that he couldn’t perform and that therefore their
performance in paying money to him was excused. He disagreed about being disabled and he wanted his job back. The case goes to arbitration, where the arbitrator
finds that (1) he is not disabled though he does have some health problems, and
(2) an affirmative order is entered that he must be reinstated. This goes all the way to the Court of Appeals
of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, a majority of which held that arbitrators can
issue orders that courts cannot unless the arbitration agreement states to the
contrary. If you don’t want an arbitration
agreement to go that far, the magic language is: “The arbitrator shall strictly
stick to the law.” The cases have gone
even further than this case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gigax</i></span>
case from the Court of Appeals in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Dayton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>, arising from <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Bing</i>, we learn that there is
an intense fiduciary duty in close corporations that can be enforced different
ways. Four people formed a company,
contributing equal amounts of money and each one being a director. For a long time, everyone got along
fine. There were no employment contracts
for a term. There were no R.C. 1701.591
agreements. But one day, three of the
directors ganged up on <span class=SpellE>Gigax</span> and gave him the pink
slip. The case had two holdings: (1) applying
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Bing</i> to the facts of this
case, there were no grounds for discharge for cause, and (2) though <span
class=SpellE>Gigax</span> wasn’t too smart, he was doing a reasonably good job,
and when you have a close corporation with no financial stringency and no
grounds for discharge for cause, the three can’t call in the fourth one and
dismiss him. The court entered an order
of reinstatement for <span class=SpellE>Gigax</span>. Then one of the judges said that there was
another branch to the case. The line of
cases stemming from <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mers</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Dispatch</i> dealt with improper
discharge. Later there was a case with a
bunch of physicians who formed a corporation. There were no employment contracts. There was an agreement up front that if a majority of the board of
directors wanted to terminate one of the doctors as an employee they could do
it. The Court of Appeals in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Dayton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> held that this was not
contrary to the holding of <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Gigax</i></span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Two
opinions from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> in the 1970’s in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pedro v. Pedro</i> dealt with a company that
had been run by <span class=SpellE>Pedros</span> for generations without an employment
contract or .591-type agreement. One
day, one of the <span class=SpellE>Pedros</span> was fired without cause. The Minnesota Supreme Court held that because
the company had a tradition of jobs for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i>
qualified <span class=SpellE>Pedros</span>, he could collect. </span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Keep
in mind that the trial court held that both parts of the agreement in the
present case were valid, but they couldn’t grant reinstatement. This is correct for 1921, though these
exceptions have been created since then. <span class=SpellE>McQuade</span> had done a good job, and he was not
fired for cause. The part of the
agreement that purported to bind the two people <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>qua</i> directors was not okay, and was contrary to public policy. It was contrary to corporate norms, and hence
unenforceable. Note that <span
class=SpellE>McQuade</span> got screwed! He paid out all this money for minority stock. They kicked him out and took his money! The court also alluded to the fact that <span
class=SpellE>McQuade</span> was a public official and he violated </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law by negotiating for a
private position while on the pubic payroll. The rest of the cases follow from this one.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
far could <span class=SpellE>McQuade</span> have gone with an enforceable contract
under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law? With
whom would he have had to negotiate? The
voting agreement is okay, but we’re talking about a position with the
company. He would have to negotiate with
the other board members, who hire and fire officers and other top
executives. The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statute provided that the
board would elect officers once a year. <span
class=SpellE>McQuade</span> could have gone to the full board and gotten a
position for a certain number of years as a high executive employee with board
approval. Such a contract will go on to
say: “Employee agrees to serve as an officer and/or a director, if elected,
without any further compensation.” In
other words, his compensation package would be spelled out for this particular
job. That’s as far as he could have gone
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> in 1921. <span
class=GramE>But what about in </span></span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  class=GramE><span>Ohio</span></span></st1:place></st1:State><span
class=GramE><span> in 2004?</span></span><span> What else could he have done, and how, under
R.C. 1701.591? Could he have gotten a
five-year contract as treasurer under .591? What do you have to do to get such an agreement? You need the concurrence of both the
directors and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> the shareholders
(including <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-voting </i>shareholders). You have to meet the technical requirements
of the statute.</span></p>

<p><span>Say
<span class=SpellE>McQuade</span> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>had</i>
entered into a five year contract, the board approved it, and it’s in
writing. Could he then be dismissed <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>with</i> cause? The answer is that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>of course</i> he can. But could
he be dismissed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>without</i> cause? If <span class=SpellE>McQuade</span> had an
agency coupled with an interest and the contract stated that it was
irrevocable, this makes for a tenth exception. <span class=SpellE>McQuade</span> bought stock, though he didn’t buy it
from the corporation. If he had bought
the stock <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>from</i> the corporation, it
would have been an agency coupled with an interest and if there was an
irrevocability clause, it would have been irrevocable. After World War II, statutes in both </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> have modified the common
law rule as to proxies. Very often in a
close corporation there will be a shareholders’ voting agreement and a proxy
given. Is that a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>proxy </i>coupled with an interest under agency law? At common law, it’s not clear, but by statute
in both </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> the answer is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>yes</i>. Furthermore, in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, if it’s in connection with
a valid employment contract, it is coupled with an interest. Keep in mind that the common law rule is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strict</i>, but consider one of the examples
given by R.2d Agency: a company is having financial problems. Smith buys stock from them and at the same
time takes an executive position. He
cannot be dismissed without cause because this is an agency coupled with an interest
and is thus irrevocable. But if the contract
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>waives</i> that protection, the waiver is
valid most of the time.</span></p>

<p><span>Here
we have sweat equity with a secret process meeting a capitalist with a lot of
money. A corporation is formed and the
capitalist is to contribute a lot of money and get 75% of the stock. Sweat equity is to turn over the secret
process and get the remaining 25% of the stock. There is a close corporation agreement between the two of them. It is limited and carefully drafted. It is limited to the lifetime of the two
individuals and it says that sweat equity will be retained as a corporate
officer as long as his work is adequate. The salary specified is reasonable. The company is formed, and after a while, the capitalist uses his 75%
stock interest to take over the board and cause the board to fire sweat
equity. Sweat equity sues for specific
performance. The trial court says that
based on <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McQuade</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Stoneham</i>, the contract violates <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>corporate norms</i>. The Court of Appeals of New York disagrees,
saying that because 100% of the shareholders had signed, the infringement of
the corporate norms were minor, the creditors weren’t hurt, and the employment
arrangement for sweat equity was only so long as he did a good job. They remand to the trial court, where it was
found that sweat equity had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>
turned over the secret process. Sweat
equity is booted out of court for having unclean hands!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
have two brothers with about 46% stock holdings each and 8% to a minority shareholder
who was a high executive employee. The
brothers did some tax planning together and entered into an agreement as to
what would happen after the first brother died. There were provisions as to voting of the stock and there were also
provisions on payments to the widow of the deceased brother. Those payments were limited, creditors weren’t
hurt because of the limits, and in addition, the payments could only be made if
they were income tax deductible. So the
first brother dies and the widow of the second brother sues for specific enforcement. There are three different sets of litigation. There is no close corporation statute in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> at the time of the litigation. This is solely a common law matter. When all is said and done, the result is: (1)
the agreement was for a reasonable length, that is, the agreement was going to
terminate on the death of the widow of the first brother to die, (2) the
purpose was reasonable, (3) the agreement was in a signed writing, (4) nothing
in the agreement hurt creditors because it was so limited, and (5) the court
was impressed with the fact that the widow’s pension was not large and that it
would cease if the amounts proved not to be tax-deductible.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
the difference between this case and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Clark
v. Dodge</i>? The difference is that we had
one non-signing shareholder: the 8% minority holder. The court wants to hold for the widow, and
they hold that the minority shareholder didn’t object and that he wasn’t really
hurt. Therefore, the agreement was
upheld. The litigation was long and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vicious</i>.</span></p>

requirements, but it doesn’t have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>this

this was a mere technical deviation that did not hurt the company or the other shareholder,
and thus that the court would enforce it. The dissent says that a rule is a rule and a requirement is a
requirement, and that the parties should have dotted their <span class=SpellE>t’s</span>
and crossed <span class=GramE>their <span class=SpellE>i</span></span><span

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

v. <span class=SpellE>Dressel</span></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
we get <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>wild!</i> We have a small, public </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> corporation. Under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, the board of directors
is to elect the president annually. Note
that the way to avoid conflict with those requirements is to have a contract
for five or ten years to be a high executive employee and to serve as an
officer or director, if elected, at no additional compensation. Here, there was no contract. The president was elected and was very
popular with a group of minority shareholders. But he got on the outs with the board of directors. Under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statute as well as </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statute, the president
could be removed with or without cause. (This
is found in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> at R.C. 1701.61-.66: the statute
says that it’s not going to affect any contract that he had.) The minority shareholders call a
meeting. All state statutes provide that
if a certain percentage of shareholders get together and sign a call and file
it with the secretary, the board must call a meeting. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> has this statute at R.C.
1701.37-.59. It’s a very populist statute! Be warned: if it’s a public company,
gathering the signatures together will constitute the solicitation of a proxy
under 1701.14. If you only do ten or
fewer, there is an exemption, but otherwise you must file a statement with the
SEC. The controlling case is <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Studebacker</i></span>, from
the Second Circuit in the 1950’s. The
second problem is that the board is going to resist this. How do you react? Under FRCP Rule 65, you file for a TRO. If you prove that you’ve filed the correct
signatures, the court will issue a mandatory injunction forcing the board to
call the meeting.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
were the purposes of the meeting in the call? It was to remove the directors for cause. Under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, there was no common
law right as of that time to remove directors without cause unless the charter
so provided. Most states in the last
fifty years have turned this around. But
it was held that there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> a common
law right to remove directors for cause. Was removing the president for cause something that created the right to
remove the directors for cause? The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> court says this should be
reviewed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>after</i> the meeting. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the courts will consider
this question <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>up front</i>. You can’t use proxies to remove directors for
cause. Proxies are used for all kinds of
purposes by shareholders!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
dissident shareholders wanted to put before all the shareholders assembled at
the meeting a resolution that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>seems</i>
to read like an order for the board to reinstate the deposed, loved
president. The court is shifty and
subtle! They admit that in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the board has the
authority to elect and remove officers. Therefore, under <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McQude</i></span>,
a shareholder resolution ordering the board to reinstate the guy would be
void. If it were an order, the court
would strike it down. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>However</i>, they construe the language of
the resolution as being <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>precatory</i></span>:
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>request</i> of the shareholders
assembled to reinstate the president. The court says that <span class=SpellE>precatory</span> resolutions to
the board as to corporate business are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fair
game</i> even if it would be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unfair</i>
if that resolution were mandatory. Why
is this important? Under SEC Rule 14(a<span
class=GramE>)(</span>8), shareholders are allowed to put in, at company
expense, certain shareholder resolutions. Management hates these!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
many instances, the shareholders cannot put in mandatory resolutions, but in
many of those instances where they can, they can change the language to: “We
respectfully request the board to do such and so” and be able to put it in. Be cautioned that (1) in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, because shareholders have
the power to amend the regulations and articles, there are times shareholders <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> put in mandatory resolutions at
meetings. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>(2) The statute on call of
meetings has been amended recently to increase the percentage required. If it’s a public company, you’ll have to file
an SEC proxy statement to get a certain percentage. (3) In Ohio, R.C. 1701.58, dealing with
removal of directors without cause, has been extensively amended in the last
five years to say that if the board is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>classified</i>
(think of the U.S. Senate: 1/3 elected every two years), you can’t remove
without cause. This was put in by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anti-takeover</i> forces. Most takeover bids in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> deal with getting control
of the board of directors of the target. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> is one of the few states where the shareholders can
amend the articles to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>increase</i> the
number of directors and to fill the vacancies. A contested takeover bid for a public company in Ohio will typically
involve the call of a meeting to increase the board from 9 to 35 (management
has the advantage of cumulative voting in most Ohio companies and will elect
some of the 26 additional directors). The
amendment to R.C. 1701.58 a few years ago is largely meaningless in the context
of a hostile tender offer in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> amendment was patterned
after </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, where the amendment actually means something
because shareholders, acting alone, cannot amend the articles or regulations. Hostile takeovers are hot stuff! We’ve just scratched the surface!</span></p>

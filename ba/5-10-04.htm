<p><span>Shipman’s
office is in 215. There will be one
in-class exam scheduled as scheduled by the Dean’s Office. It will be all <span class=GramE>essay</span>,
5-7 moderately brief problem-type questions. I think he said it will be three hours long. If you don’t cut to the chase by the third
full paragraph, you’re probably never going to cut to the chase. So cut to the chase when you write for a
Shipman exam!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Old
exam questions will be available for our study. There will be a review session coming up soon.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Why are we here?</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a bar subject: agency, partnership, and corporations are a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big</i> bar subject. In a couple of years, we’ll be able to
connect with the bar review people and figure out what’s what.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Agency
is the “step-child” of the curriculum. We’ll be taught enough in here to hook up with the bar review
people. <span class=GramE>“Spinach
before ice cream.”</span> Take your bar
courses! The bar review people start in
the “middle”. The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> bar has been tightened up
in the last eight years. Five years ago,
the median grade was made into the minimum grade. It’s not an impossible bar, but it’s become
more difficult. <span class=GramE>So
take the bar courses so that you’ll “hook up”.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Also,
a lot of lawyers actually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do </i>this
type of work. If you practice family
law, you’ll use this stuff <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>every day</i>. If you do real estate law, franchise law,
international law, tax law and stuff like that you’ll use this material every
day you practice. If you litigate, you’ll
see a lot of litigation in this area.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Finally,
business is very important in the “American scheme of things”. This course is basic literacy for
understanding business in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about disadvantages of the course? It’s
intense! If you fall asleep, you’re
screwed! You have to keep your outline
up-to-date because we’ll cover the equivalent of eight sessions per week. But the advantage is that people are more
relaxed in the summer than general. And
the weather is better! That’s a
plus. Also, the concentrated nature of
the class helps keep your mind on the subject. During the semester, you can get distracted by other courses.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
another disadvantage is that it will be the first course with a heavy emphasis
on statutes and regulations. They are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>taken seriously</i>. We don’t practice philosophy concerning the statutes
and regulations, we <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>master</i> them. Some will love it, some will hate it, but it’s
a fact of life that lawyers must deal with this.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is the first course in law school that is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>heavily</i>
operational. Evidence, Tax, Secured
Transactions, and International Business are also heavily operational. We look at the conceptual end too, but mostly
the operational side. We’ll spend a
modest amount of time on the role of the lawyer in these transactions, which is
important because lawyers can get themselves in a lot of trouble.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So,
prepare reasonably well each day, take good notes, outline once a week, come to
the review sessions, and it will come together in a good way by the end. There are advanced courses beyond this, but
the foundational course is usually the most important.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you must miss a class or two, don’t worry about it, but if it goes beyond that,
check with Shipman or give his secretary a memo. Shipman expects reasonably good attendance.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Another
minus: these classes are long! At </span><st1:time
Minute="40" Hour="12"><span>12:40</span></st1:time><span>, we’ll get a 15 minute
break. We’ll get back at </span><st1:time
Minute="55" Hour="12"><span>12:55</span></st1:time><span> and wrap up at </span><st1:time
Minute="30" Hour="13"><span>1:30</span></st1:time><span>. Nobody can stand 100 minutes of this stuff.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>John Locke</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
begin at the beginning (a very good place to start)…with John Locke. In the 1670’s, he wrote in support of the Whig
view of the world. The Whigs were
opposed to the views of Hobbes, who supported absolute power in the king. Locke’s writing blends economics and political
science. It goes well beyond Aristotle
and Plato, who were very disdainful of commercial and business
undertakings. But by Locke’s time, the
situation had changed both in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Britain</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> and in other places. He arrived at the simplistic but absolutely
true formula that in order to make money, you had to add labor to capital.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The Wealth of Nations</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>About
100 years later, Adam Smith came around with The Wealth of Nations. Smith went beyond Locke and talked about the
need for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>management</i> added to labor
and capital and the need for free markets, which both </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Britain</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> and the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> adopted. As we’ll see tomorrow, the big devotees of
Adam Smith in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> were not the Federalists,
but the <span class=SpellE>Jeffersonians</span>. This surprises a lot of people!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Everybody
classifies associations a different way. This is Shipman’s way, and it’s as good as anything.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Sole proprietorships</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Sole proprietorships</span></i><span> have a long history, and
they are still around today. Joe Jones
runs a small grocery store as a sole proprietor. What does that mean? There is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no</i>
business association there. Joe is
simply running it. His <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>whole estate</i> is liable for all of the
debts of the grocery store. If he wants
to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sell </i>the grocery store, he has to
make out the bills of sale and the deeds and then he’ll have to consider tax
factors. With a sole proprietorship, the
individual Form 1040 of Joe Jones will reflect his income or loss from the
grocery store along with his other income or loss. Where is it reflected? It’s on Schedule C of Form 1040. Joe will be taxed on his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>total</i> income (if he’s single) at the current tax rate, which runs
up to about 36% for federal income tax, and in Ohio it will run up to
6.9%. It’s higher in a few states.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
is that all? No. His income, up to a maximum of about $82,000,
will be subject to a self-employment tax (yuck). That’s part of the Social Security
system. This tax will be about 160% of
what an employee of <span class=GramE>an incorporation</span> would pay. If you’re an employee, you pay about 7-8% on
the first $80,000, and the corporation pays the same amount. It goes into your Social Security
account. If you’re a sole proprietor,
you have to pay both income tax and the substantial self-employment tax. But that’s not all either! There’s a Medicare tax that is unlimited in
amount. Are we finished? No. Joe <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>should</i> be using either a
corporation or an LLC (a limited liability company). The LLC is a “child” of the last twenty years. What is its big advantage? It has all the tax advantages of a general partnership,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> it also has the corporate
advantage of limited liability. No one
who is thinking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>advertently </i>uses a
sole proprietorship or a general partnership. You’ll go for an LLC or a corporation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Another comment on Mr. Jones.</span></span><span> We’re not
finished with him yet. If Joe is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>married</i>, he will most likely file a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>joint return</i> with his wife. At times, they’re better off filing separate
returns, but that is relatively rare. Usually, you’ll save money filing joint returns. Does the wife take a risk by signing the
joint federal income tax return? Family
law and tax law will constantly bubble up in this course, and this is a
family/tax law problem. If the wife
files her <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>own separate return</i>, then
she has no individual liability if her husband’s return is screwed up. If a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>joint</i>
return is filed, generally, the wife will have joint and several liability,
even if the screw-up relates to the husband’s income, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>but </i>there are two or three affirmative “innocent spouse” defenses
that sometimes work and sometimes don’t. We’ll see more about this when we take more tax courses. When you file a joint return, each spouse has
a duty to make sure that the tax return is in order. “You’re in bed with your spouse in more ways
than one…and you can get screwed in more ways than one, as Bubba would say.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
won’t talk about sole proprietorships very much, because a lawyer setting one
of these up is almost malpractice <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se</i>. Usually, if a business is getting set up this
way, the guy is doing it himself.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>For
today, we read the old statute on general partnerships. This is the statute as of 1914. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, we have a version of that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>old</i> statute, and that’s what we will
work with. Toward the end of the year,
when we look at partnerships in detail, we’ll look at the newer statute that is
in effect in about 75% of the states. It’s
called RUPA: the Revised Uniform Partnership Act. Each state has slightly different versions of
the thing, the casebook material has a lot of text on RUPA, and we will
consider it. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>But</i>: if Shipman sets up “a partnership problem in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>” on an exam, and most of
his questions <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are</i> set in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, then we should cite to UPA
1914, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> RUPA. We can discuss what RUPA does, but only by
analogy. That’s the only way that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> courts will currently
consider RUPA. If there’s a close question
under UPA 1914, the courts will go with the way the RUPA does it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>General partnerships</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
the definition: A <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general partnership </i>is
one in which <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> partners are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general </i>partners. The emphasis here is on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>general</i>. Under UPA §§ 1-18,
plus 40, there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>joint and several
liability</i> on the part of all partners for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>tort</i> debts of the general partnership, and there is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>joint</i> liability for all of the partners’
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contract </i>debts. When you read §§ 18 and 40 and put them
together, you will find that you can sue not only the partnership for the
assets it has, but if it doesn’t have enough, you can go after the individual partners
and reach their personal estates. Ouch! That’s called the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>disadvantage of unlimited personal liability</i>. It’s a big disadvantage…how come? No one with any sense advertently forms a general
partnership today. For a lawyer to
recommend it is malpractice <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se</i>. Why? We’ll find at the end of the course that in the last 25 years, the LLC
has arrived and the Ohio LLC statute, O.R.C. § 1705, is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>excellent</i>. The LLC, with
proper drafting, will give the tax advantages of a general partnership with the
limited liability advantage of a corporation. “AC/DC! Going both ways at the
same time and loving it! <span
class=GramE>A business feast!”</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
are we putting partnerships off until the end of the course? There are two tough parts of the course. (1) Securities, which we’ll get to in about
2.5 weeks. (2) Partnerships are
tough. They’re not superficially tough,
but when we go through them in depth, we’ll have headaches. We won’t frontload the course with them. Also, corporations are more logical, and once
you go through the logical corporate setup, you can make the transition to partnerships
fairly easily. Just learning partnerships
on its own without some agency law under our belts will drive us crazy.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
what is the great tax advantage of general partnerships? We will find after the break that corporations
in this country historically have been subject to a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>double tax</i>. It’s been
modified a lot in the last 45 years, but big portions of it still remain. This is because a corporation is considered
as a full-fledged legal entity separate from the shareholders for tax and other
purposes. As such, historically, the corporation
was subject to tax on what it earned, and then, when it paid dividends, the
dividends were fully taxable again to the shareholder recipients. By the end of today, we’ll see that there
have been two ameliorations of that, though to some extent it’s still
true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the
ability of Congress to do this even before the Sixteenth Amendment was
passed. It was said that the government bestows
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>privilege</i> upon people to set up
an entity with limited liability, and thus Congress can levy a tax on that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>privilege</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A general
partnership, because it has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>three strong
non-resemblances to a corporation</i>, is not subject to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>income </i>taxes. The emphasis
is on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>income</i> taxes, because a general
partnership is subject to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>excise </i>taxes,
it must withhold taxes on salaries of employees, it is subject to sales taxes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>but</i> it isn’t subject to income
taxes. How has Congress treated general
partnerships since 1913? They have said
that, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in general</i>, with some
exceptions to follow later, the partnership is considered a non-entity for
income tax purposes. The income and
losses of the partnership <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>flow through</i>
to the individual partners and is taxed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>to
them</i>. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>However</i>, by statute, the partnership must file <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>information</i> returns with the IRS. Those information returns enable the IRS to collect from the partners.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>As
to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>employees</i> of the partnership, they’re
just like corporate employees. The partnership
must pay and withhold Social Security tax. Partners pay taxes just like sole proprietors. Each quarter, they must file a declaration of
estimated taxes for the year and pay one-fourth of it. When they file their final return, they “settle
up”. If they paid too much, they’ll get
a refund, and if they paid too little, they’ll have to write another check to
the IRS. Until 1960, general partnerships
were very popular in the service areas, for example, law, accounting, medicine,
dentistry, and engineering. This is
because there was no double taxation, and state statutes as to law, doctors,
dentists and accountants provided that those professions had to practice as
sole proprietors or general partnerships to expose to the world not only the
assets the partnership owned, but also the personal property of the partners
individually.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Congress
discerned that there were three significant non-corporate attributes of a general
partnership:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span

12.0pt'>of all of the partners for the debts of the partnership in addition to
the partnership itself being liable. This is huge!</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>§§ 18-32 of the UPA 1914 introduce
us to the idea that a general partnership is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>easily dissolved</i>. Dissolution is defined specially in the UPA and it has an odd meaning. It doesn’t mean <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>death</i>. It means a “change in
legal relationship among the partners”. It
says, for example, that death, retirement, or bankruptcy of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> general partner causes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dissolution</i> of the partnership, but not
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>death</i> of the partnership. What it does mean, however, is that the party
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>leaving</i> the partnership by death,
retirement, or bankruptcy is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entitled </i>to
the amount credited to her capital account and, unless the parties have contracted
otherwise, entitled to that amount in fairly short order.<br>
<br>
Compare this to the situation of Jones Retail Store, Inc. It has four siblings working in the store. Upon the death of one of the Jones siblings,
there is no dissolution, meaning that the widow of the dying Jones sibling <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cannot</i> get the fair value of the shares from
the company <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless </i>there is a
specific contractual provision to the contrary. That’s just the opposite from a general partnership because the death,
retirement, bankruptcy, or insanity of one or more shareholders of a corporation
does <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> affect the ongoing life of
the corporation. The corollary to that
is that the same is true even if one or more or all of the shareholders assign
all of their shares to somebody else. Thus,
the corporation is guaranteed by law to have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>perpetual life</i>! Whereas with
the general partnership, death, retirement, bankruptcy or insanity cause
dissolution. The guy who went crazy can
withdraw his whole capital account.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>With a corporation, unless
there are valid reasonable restraints on alienation, any or all shareholders
can sell any or all of their shares to anyone for any reason <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at any time</i>. “Daddy <span class=SpellE>Warbucks</span>
walks again!” Needless to say, even the
closely held corporation with a few shareholders is set up in such a way to
sell its shares to the public if the public wants it. We’ll spend more time on that later: the
IPO. For example, <span class=SpellE>Google</span>
is about to do their IPO. The owners of <span
class=SpellE>Google</span> will be billionaires. They won’t be as rich as Bill Gates, “but
hey, you won’t have to give them soup money.” The general partnership, on the other hand, is set up for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-public ownership</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>These
three differences led Congress to say that a general partnership doesn’t
resemble a corporation very much. When
we get to the LLC, clever drafters at the state level came up with a new animal
from civil law countries like </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Mexico</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>: the LLC, which had limited
liability. The Clinton Administration
was persuaded that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>most </i>unincorporated
business associations, if they “checked the box” on their first return saying
that they wanted to be treated as a general partnership for tax purposes, then
they’ll be treated that way. (Subchapter
K is the subchapter of the internal revenue code that deals with partnerships.)</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We’ll
move right along covering just a part of the law of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>associations</i>.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Not-for-profit associations</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you’ve read <span class=SpellE>Detoqueville</span>, you’re very aware of his
emphasis on “voluntary associations”, or non-profit associations in the private
sector. These organizations <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mediate</i> between the government and the
population at large. Take the church,
for example. <span class=GramE>Or
political parties, or chambers of commerce, or Sunkist.</span> Or you form “The Committee to Fight the Power
Lines”. All of these are different from
General Motors. Their goal is to make
profits for their shareholders. Not-for-profit associations can be incorporated <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>or</i> unincorporated. The
not-for-profit corporation statute in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> is O.R.C. § 1702. We won’t spend a lot of time on it. For more information, get the hornbook by <span
class=SpellE>Oleck</span>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Not-For-Profit
Corporations</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Tomorrow,
we’ll talk about a recent Fifth Circuit case involving two famous political
figures: Karl Rove and Richard Thornburgh (former United States Attorney
General). Most politicians <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>incorporate</i> their campaign committee. That’s because at the end of the day, the committee
may have run up more debts than they are able to pay. If you incorporate, then the candidate can
walk away from the debts at the end. On
the other hand, Thornburgh did not incorporate his campaign committee. He hired Rove, who did a good job for him,
but he lost, and he owed $400,000 or so to Rove. Rove was not a shy fellow, and he personally
sued Thornburgh. In “one of the <span
class=SpellE>damndest</span> opinions I have ever read”, Shipman found that </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law would govern. But there’s a federal statute that says that
the candidate himself won’t be liable for these debts. The Fifth Circuit found that Thornburgh
wouldn’t be liable in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>capacity</i> of
a candidate, but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>would</i> be liable in
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>capacity</i> of an individual. The Circuit also found that there was no
preemption. The court chastised Thornburgh
for not incorporating, and the rest of the opinion was pretty predictable. The Circuit concluded that the committee as a
quasi-entity would be liable, the actual executives of the committee would be liable,
and they held that if the inactive members of such an association ratify or
approve in any way, direct or indirect, what the managers have done, they <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>also</i> are liable. That’s standard American law. If the campaign committee were <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>incorporated</i>, you wouldn’t get to these
levels. But was Thornburgh, the
candidate, himself a member of the committee? They couldn’t find a formal piece of paper that said he was, but they
said it would defy common sense to hold that he wasn’t a member of his own committee. The bottom line is that Thornburgh is out
$400,000, non-tax-deductible! And this
guy was a former Attorney General of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>! “Stupidity runs to all social classes and all
IQ strata. You can find some of the
smartest IQ people in highest positions doing the <span class=SpellE>goddamndest</span>
things that you will ever see.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>They
also lectured Thornburgh on a way out of the dilemma if he was stupid enough
not to incorporate. They said that he
could have used “non-recourse contracts or notes”. This is very important! We’ll run into this three or four times in
the course. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>If</i>, the court held, the contract with Rove had stated that only the
assets of the committee could be reached by Rove, then in a contract case this
provision would have been fully valid and would have sent Rove back to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Austin</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> without his $400,000. So the court gave Thornburgh some lectures on
how to get it right next time. He was an
“unconscious hero” who taught us through his own pain and suffering “how not to
screw up”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
not-for-profits can be incorporated or not, but you should <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>always</i> incorporate them. Most states have good statutes about this. Look at O.R.C. § 1702 or <span class=SpellE>Oleck</span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Not-for-profit
corporations will not have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shareholders</i>,
they will have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>members</i>. The people who run the not-for-profit will be
called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directors </i>or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>trustees</i>. Below them will be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>officers</i>. Beneath them will
be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-officer executives</i>. And below that, you have “the people who
actually do the work”. There will be
creditors in a not-for-profit corporation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
do we care about § 1702? At the end of
§§ 1701 and 1702, they both state the following: “§ 1701 applies to corporations
formed under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other</i> chapters (e.g. §
1702), except to the extent that § 1702 is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inconsistent</i>
with § 1701, in which event you go to § 1702.” Is it always to determine when there is inconsistency? No. Go
to § 1702, and you’ll find the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mirror
image of that</i>. It says: “In
construing this chapter, construe it with § 1701, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>except</i> if § 1701 is inconsistent, in which case use this statute.” The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>specific
trumps the general every time</i>.</span></p>

          >A word about statutes: the first thing you do is read them carefully.
          Use the plain meaning of the text first; that�s where you start.
          <span class="GramE">Most of the time that�s also where you end.</span>
          But, later in the course, we will spend time with fiduciary duties,
          which are largely a product of court decisions. Legislatures, by and
          large, leave the issue up to the courts. Fiduciary duties can take
          strange twists and turns.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Statutes usually have a long list of definitions at the front, and
          R.C. Chapter 1701 is no exception. In the old days, these definitions
          were alphabetical, but about 25 years ago, they gave up, and thus they
          are no longer alphabetical. We need to read these definitions
          carefully, noting that they�re in no particular order.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gearing </i>that the woman, by
          purposefully being absent from the meeting, sort of �dirtied her
          hands� in a way that equity is not available to her. This case ties in
          to the issue of what makes for a valid vote by directors or by
          shareholders. There are four requirements:</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Valid call</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There must be a valid
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">call</i> by a person having the
          authority to call. In
          <span class="GramE"
            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gearing</i></span
          >, for example, the guy on the other side appears to have the power to
          call. By way of explanation, the statutes distinguish between annual
          meetings versus other meetings scheduled by the charter or regulations
          (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">special </i>meetings). In
          general, the people in charge of a company will give notice of general
          or annual meetings. The O.R.C. requires that for shareholders�
          meetings. As to directors� meetings, however, the O.R.C. appears to
          say that the notice for directors of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">either</i> special or general
          meetings need not state the purpose. That is contrary to the common
          law, and if you�re the chairman of the board, you ignore this in
          practice and give decent notice anyway with the purpose.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Valid notice as to time, place, and purpose</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">notice </i>must be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">valid</i> as to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">time</i>,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">place</i>, and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">purpose</i>. The rules are
          slightly different for shareholders as opposed to directors. At common
          law, if it is a regular meeting, in theory, notice need not be given.
          But in practice, you should not rely on that rule, especially if
          you�re a public company. If you�re a public company, you must follow
          SEC rules.<br />
          <br />
          How much lead time do you have to give? Check your charter, bylaws,
          and state statutes and find out how much notice is required and how
          you compute it. Be careful! R.C. 1701.02 says there is a �mailbox
          rule�, more or less.
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">But</i>�Shipman says this is
          probably unconstitutional under
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tulsa Collection</i>, a U.S.
          Supreme Court opinion written by Justice O�Connor. This is part of the
          line of cases defining procedural due process for state action. It�s a
          long line of cases that starts with
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            ><a href="../civpro/mullanevcentralhanoverbanktrustco.html"
              >Mullane</a

          >
          from the 1940s. That case involved the settlement of common trust
          funds. Banks got the New York legislature to pass a statute that
          individual notice didn�t have to be given to
          <span class="SpellE">settlees</span>, but rather than publication in a
          newspaper in Manhattan would be enough. Justice Jackson wrote the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">seminal</i> procedural due
          process opinion of all time, and said that this procedure isn�t valid
          under the Fourteenth Amendment! For known beneficiaries, he said,
          notice must be given by ordinary mail.<br />
          <br />
          In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tulsa Collection</i>, a will
          was admitted to probate in Oklahoma. The Oklahoma statute provided
          that notice must be given within 60 days after publication in an
          Oklahoma newspaper of the death of the decedent and those who didn�t
          meet the deadline were
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">forever barred</i>! The facts
          were that the decedent had a big debt to the hospital for his last
          illness. The executor was very aware of this and gave no actual notice
          to the hospital. The hospital failed to meet the deadline! Thus, the
          executor says: you�re out of luck! Justice O�Connor held that in a
          �garden-variety� case, there is no state action for purposes of the
          Fourteenth Amendment. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">But</i>,
          she says, where there is a sharp, Draconian period, it won�t govern as
          to creditors that the executor
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">knew</i> or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">should have known</i> about. As
          to those people, individual notice by ordinary mail and a decently
          long statute of limitations is required. Therefore, the hospital
          wasn�t cut off from filing their personal claim in the probate
          proceeding.<br />
          <br />
          Another big case just before
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tulsa Collection</i> was a
          mortgage foreclosure in Indiana, where a first mortgage was
          foreclosed. Everyone knew that there was a second mortgage and the
          address of the holder of that second mortgage was known to everyone.
          Justice Marshall said that individual notice by ordinary mail was
          required by the Fourteenth Amendment. If you put those cases together,
          R.C. 1701.02 appears to violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Besides, now
          we have fax machines and the internet, and thus it makes no sense! In
          a close corporation, you would generally know how to reach the
          directors and shareholders by fax or e-mail. If you need to give five
          days advance notice, just fax it! So you wouldn�t follow R.C. 1701.02
          even if it
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">were</i> constitutional.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Check if the quorum requirement is met! Look at the statute,
          regulations, and the charter, and if there is a special agreement
          under R.C. 1701.591, you must look at that too. Those agreements are
          kind of rare, though. If you have four directors and one resigns, then
          the quorum remains at
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">three</i> (a majority of the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">full membership</i>). But a
          quorum need not mean a majority. Maybe it means that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">everyone</i> must be
          there!</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are two big exceptions: (1) Ohio�s statute says: if there is a
          vacancy in the board of directors due to death, resignation, total
          disability, etc., then �unless the articles are to the contrary, the
          remaining directors can fill the vacancy
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">even if</i> the remaining

          represented <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in person </i>or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">by proxy</i>. Proxy means that
          you get permission from another shareholder to vote on their behalf at
          a certain meeting on a certain date. That piece of paper is called the
          proxy. The person who holds it is called the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">proxy agent</i>. For a big
          public company, they will solicit your proxy, as required by federal
          law. You sign the proxy card and they will send you a stamped return
          envelope, you put it in the envelope and return it. Almost all proxies
          are revocable, because it�s an agency that�s seldom coupled with an
          interest. The interest of the proxy agent in voting, standing by
          <span class="GramE">itself,</span> is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> enough to make it an

      <p>
        <span
          >What are the exceptions again? Let�s say Smith is the President and
          CEO of Smith, Inc., which is a corporation. Smith owns 100% of the
          stock. The company runs a mid-sized grocery store. The problem is that
          the corporation is having financial difficulties. Mr. Smith talks to
          Mr. Jones and asks Jones to sign a two-year contract with the
          corporation as
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">general manager</i> (not an
          officer). Part of the deal is that Mr. Jones will lend the company
          $200,000. Mr. Jones�s lawyer says Jones will do this only if Smith
          gives Jones an irrevocable proxy to vote his stock during the two year
          period. Smith agrees and writes out a document as an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">irrevocable proxy</i>. The last
          paragraph says: �This is a proxy coupled with an interest, and it is
          irrevocable for the two year period.� According to the Restatement
          Second, that will be a valid, irrevocable proxy for the two years
          because it�s coupled with an interest.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >New York and Delaware, by statute, go even further, saying that if
          Jones doesn�t lend any money but simply agrees to be general manager
          for two years under a two-year signed contract, that if a proxy is
          given and it is stated to be irrevocable, then it will (by golly!) be
          irrevocable because the statute says so! </span

          formal dissent from the board action!� If you�re absent from a
          meeting, you must get the minutes as fast as possible, and if you

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">formally</i> entering a dissent
          to the board of directors. The majority rule is not only
          counterintuitive, but it also builds up bad relations on the board.
          It�s annoying enough to vote no! But when you turn to the secretary
          and dictate your dissent, it really ticks people off! But there is a
          time not only to vote no, but to make sure you enter your dissent into
          the minutes. The way corporate cultures operate, once directors get
          the agenda for a meeting and they decide they�ll vote no, they tell
          the other directors in advance. This is often enough to kill the
          action.</span

          theory, meaning that each side is highly rational and will vote to

          that it always reflects the real world. So how will the two sides
          likely vote? Take the number of shares times the number of directors
          to be elected. Thus, each side has 400 votes. The statute says that
          you can accumulate and spread among one or more of the four as you
          wish to maximize your situation. The ballot will likely come back with
          200 votes for each of Jones-1, Jones-2, Smith-1, and Smith-2. Let�s
          assume all the requirements for a valid vote have been met and that
          there has been notice given that cumulative voting will be happening.
          The Inspector of Elections issues a certificate of the result. There
          were only four candidates, and therefore a new board will take over!

          a deadlock! No one is elected! There are no three directors with a
          plurality over the fourth! The result is that the Inspector of
          Elections will enter an order than no directors were elected at the
          meeting and that the old board of directors carries over. Don�t forget
          that in the corporate world, when it comes to directors and officers,
          you�re elected to serve for a term plus so much longer, if needed,
          until your successors are duly elected and qualified. (What does
          qualified mean? When someone gets elected to be a director or officer,
          have them send a letter of acceptance.) Cumulative voting prevents

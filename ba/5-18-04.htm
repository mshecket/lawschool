          dealt with the fiduciary duty aspect of the promoter�s liability
          doctrine. Since the promoter took a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">non-negotiable</i> note and
          assigned it to the plaintiff, the plaintiff took over all of the
          disabilities of the assignor and because he couldn�t meet any one of
          the three <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">validating tests</i>,
          he stood in the shoes of the promoter and his claim for secured status
          was denied.</span

        <span
          >What�s the situation? The promoters formed the corporation and each
          of the promoters got stock in the corporation for $5. Soon after that,
          the corporation issues stock to the public and charges the public $15
          per share. It was not alleged that there was any fraud in either sale
          of stock. Furthermore, there is no injury to creditors alleged. Why?
          It�s because the company is receiving money for stock and upon
          liquidation, stockholders take last after creditors
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and</i> no fraud is
          alleged.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Here are four flavors of action. They�re related, but different.
          First, consider legal actions on
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">behalf</i> of the corporation.
          The easiest one is the case of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Frick v. Howard</i>, where a
          company goes insolvent and there is either a voluntary or involuntary
          state court receivership
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">or</i> a trustee in bankruptcy
          (�T/B�) who is appointed in a bankruptcy action in the United States
          Bankruptcy Court under 11 U.S.C. State court receiverships are quite
          complicated, and federal actions are even more so! These are called
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">universal successors</i> to all
          of the assets and causes of action of the corporation. The state court
          receiver or trustee in bankruptcy can do two things: (1)
          <span class="GramE">They</span> can assert any causes of action on
          behalf of the corporation that the corporation has. The benefit of
          these causes of action ultimately goes to the creditors. �It�s a
          salvage operation, and it�s vicious, baby!� (2) The </span
        ><st1:country-region
          ><st1:place><span>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region
        ><span>
          bankruptcy judge or state court receiver has jurisdiction to pass on
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">claims</i>. They must be filed
          correctly and in a timely manner. And the court for any good equitable
          or legal reason can disallow claims or �push them down in the pecking
          order�. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>In
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Frick</i>, the court says that
          if the claim was refilled as an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">unsecured</i> creditor�s claim,
          there might be a chance. But the unsecured creditors sit at the bottom
          of the pecking order.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Next up, we have shareholder derivative actions, governed by Rule
          23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. A shareholder files a
          complaint, served it on the corporation and the actual defendants,
          alleging that the defendants have
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">overreached</i> the corporation
          in some way. The shareholder goes on to allege that the corporation
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">should</i> sue, but it hasn�t
          because the defendants
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">dominate the corporation</i>
          and �they <span class="SpellE">ain�t</span> going to sue themselves�.
          Therefore, the shareholder wants to sue
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">on behalf of the corporation</i
          >.
          <span class="GramE"
            >If the court approves this (after a whole bunch of motions before
            the answer), then the suit is tried.</span
          >
          If the plaintiff gets a judgment, the attorney for the plaintiff moves
          for attorney�s fees and there is notice and opportunity for hearing on
          the attorney�s fees. Then the attorney for the plaintiff takes off the
          top. These actions are driven by plaintiffs� lawyers! What�s left
          after that (and �sometimes it�s a lot, baby�) goes to the corporation
          and the judgment is <span class="SpellE">res</span>
          <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> as to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">all </i>shareholders (not just
          the suing plaintiffs), the corporation, and all defendants. It�s a �<i
            style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >true </i
          ><span class="SpellE">true</span> class action� because no plaintiff
          can opt out. What the judge says is <span class="SpellE">res</span>
          <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> as to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">everybody</i>. This is powerful
          stuff!!! If the defendants win, it�s also
          <span class="SpellE">res</span>
          <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> as to everybody (they walk away
          scot-free). There are two other possibilities: (1) settlement, or (2)
          dismissal. Under Rule 23.1,
          <span class="GramE"
            >these are possible only after the court orders a hearing and
            determines</span
          >
          that it�s to everyone�s benefit to approve the settlement or
          dismissal. Any settlement will contain extensive provisions for the
          attorneys.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>There�s a big case in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place

        ><span>
          dealing with this issue right now. There�s a several billion dollar
          settlement, and the attorneys are asking for hundreds of millions of
          dollars in fees! But some of the members of the class are looking at
          the proposed settlement and are objecting to the proposed attorney�s
          fees! Yikes, they say! They are going to hire more attorneys to be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">professional objectors</i> to
          the fees! They want to reduce the fees from $600 million to $200
          million.

        <span
          >Shipman observes that defendants sometimes love class actions because
          the defendant�s dream is to settle early, offer a good amount to the
          class action lawyer, go before a judge, have a hearing, and have the
          judge approve the settlement, giving you
          <span class="SpellE">res</span>
          <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> for everybody and forever. In
          class actions in most places, however, when there is a notice of a
          class action proceeding, class members can ask to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">opt out</i>. In
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Matsushita</i>, you had a
          friendly tender offer for a movie studio by a Japanese company. It was
          a good cash tender offer at a good price. The family that owned the
          controlling stake in the company didn�t like the fact that it was in
          cash because they would have to pay taxes on it. They went to the
          offeror and asked to have them pay with
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">stock</i> instead of cash. They
          agreed. But the problem was that two SEC rules were violated (14d-10
          and 10b-13)! After the deal closed, a class action in the federal
          district court in </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Los Angeles</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          started up under federal law. But then there was also a parallel
          action out of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Delaware</span></st1:place

        ><span> state court under </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> law! The </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          courts couldn�t hear the SEC issues! The parties settled in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>. The defendants took the settlement from </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> to </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Los Angeles</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          and claimed <span class="SpellE">res</span>
          <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>. �Let my defendants go!� It went
          to the U.S. Supreme Court, which held that as long as the hearing on
          settlement meets the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments, then a
          settlement in a state court can cover both the state action
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and</i> related federal action.
          But it wasn�t all over yet. The case went back to </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Los Angeles</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          and a panel of the Ninth Circuit found that Justice Thomas, writing
          for a 9-0 Court, �didn�t really mean what he said�. �Is that chutzpah
          or is that chutzpah?� There was a rehearing en banc before all the
          Circuit judges. The full court overturned the panel! The upshot of the
          case is that some defendants love class actions because they love
          early settlements. Note, however, that those people who opted out of
          the federal and state actions could proceed on their own. Let�s look
          at two prominent class action lawyers: O�Quinn (from </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Houston</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>) and <span class="SpellE">Chesley</span> (from </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Cincinnati</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span
          >). They have opposite approaches. Grisham�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">King of Torts</i> goes over all
          this.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What if the plaintiff wins but doesn�t get money damages? Can
          attorney�s fees be recovered? You�ll find that if the plaintiff�s
          lawyer shows a definite benefit to the client or the corporation then
          they can get reasonable attorney�s fees. Later in the course we�ll
          cover the doctrine of ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span>. If you
          bring an equity action before the act has taken place (which any one
          shareholder can bring), and if an injunction is awarded after the
          plaintiff wins, then most costs will award attorney�s fees even if no
          money has been awarded.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There can be direct action by shareholders against the corporation or
          its fiduciaries. If there is an ultra
          <span class="SpellE">vires</span> action, the action can be asserted
          derivatively or directly. The lawyer will always choose direct because
          Rule 23.1 is a �plaintiff�s killing field�. Similarly, like an action
          to force declaration of a dividend, can be asserted by either a class
          action of shareholders against a corporation or a single shareholder.
          The plaintiff�s lawyer will make his decision based on what�s likely
          to get better attorney�s fees. That�s just how it is!</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In the Massachusetts
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Old Dominion</i> case, which
          dealt with a few of the promoters, it was said that the public selling
          price determined the value of the shares, and the promoters must pay
          the company the difference between $5 and $15 times the number of
          shares purchased. In the federal
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Old Dominion</i> case, written
          by Holmes, it was said that one of the exceptions to conflict of
          interest regulations applied here because (1) there was no injury to
          creditors, (2) no fraud or information deficiency was alleged, and (3)
          there was consent of all shareholders. That creates a defense to
          conflict of interest? How did the </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Massachusetts</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Old Dominion</i> case
          distinguish Holmes�s opinion? They said that at the time of the
          promotion a public offering was contemplated and that the low price of
          the promoters was not put in the perspective, and so there was no
          unanimous consent of all shareholders.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Rule 10b-5 says that when a promoter buys stock, for the next five
          years, whenever the corporation issues stock to other people, publicly
          or privately, you must disclose that (this is the �five year� rule).
          Thus, today, the promoters in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Old Dominion</i> would have put
          a paragraph in the offering circular that disclosed the stock holdings
          of the promoters. They would have disclosed that the promoters paid $5
          per share even though they were asking $15 per share from the public.
          You must do this or risk violating federal and state securities laws!
          If the promoters had followed the SEC disclosure laws, then there will
          be unanimous shareholder approval, no harm to creditors (because it�s
          beneath the creditors), no informational deficiency, and no fraud. Put
          it all together, and you get one of the exceptions to liability under
          conflict of interest regulation.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Well, if people are aware of SEC disclosure rules, and other those
          rules these cases are irrelevant, why are these cases important? It�s
          all about compensating the promoter and compensating
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">sweat equity</i>. Today, the
          offering circular to the public would fully disclose the $5 price.
          Generally, for tax purposes, if the promoters organize for $5 and then
          you go to the public at $15, within two years of when you do it, the
          IRS will say to the promoters: �You have $10 per share of ordinary
          income! Pay up!� If it�s over two years, the tax cases say that it is
          clear that the promotion was �old and cold�.</span

        <span
          >So what is the lesson of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Old Dominion</i>? We want to
          find the true value of stock as applicable to the marriage,
          business-wise, of sweat-equity and capitalists. (�Not an odd couple.
          They get along well and they can make a lot of money.�) Let�s start a
          new business! We need $1 million. There�s a capitalist who has that
          much cash, but he needs someone to run the company on a day-to-day
          business. Let�s say the capitalist will work 40 hours per week. He�s a
          retired doctor who is no longer practicing medicine. He needs someone
          to put in the 80-hour
          <span class="GramE">weeks who has</span> detailed operating knowledge
          of the business (which the capitalist doesn�t have). Let�s use
          Subchapter S because the projections show that there are going to be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">big losses</i> for three years,
          and then there will hopefully be a turnaround! The capitalist finds
          sweat equity and makes a handshake agreement that the corporation�s
          two directors will enter into a three-year signed, written contract
          for sweat equity with enough money for him to live on. There will be a
          similar contract for the capitalist for less money (because he�ll be
          working less). Part of the sweat equity deal is that the guy gets

          corporation are clearly qualifying non-cash property), and 83 (if you

          value it at its value if it had
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">no </i>restriction on it). In
          this transaction, the transfer of shares must be restricted for two
          years under federal and state securities laws. The restrictions will
          be on the face of the certificates. It will be fully valid if the
          restrictions are on the face in full caps: that�s considered a

          buys 1000 shares at $1 each. There is a restriction on the face of the
          certificate. The sweat equity dude buys 1000 shares at $1000 per
          share. The
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Old Dominion</i> rule says that
          you take the highest price paid and project that value backwards to
          everyone. So our sweat equity has $999,000 income. Each share is worth
          $1000. He paid $1 for it. So we multiply $999 times the number of
          shares, 1000. If the sweat equity person is rich, then it�s no
          problem. They can cut a check. But, for the average person this is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">total disaster</i>. Even for

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">service income</i> to sweat
          equity. Then you look at another Internal Revenue Code section: � 162.
          It�s not quite as bad for sweat equity as it looks. He gets a
          deduction! Bill Gates can use a big deduction! Since he�s working for
          the company full-time, he has this great deduction. But the Internal
          Revenue Service will contend that the sweat equity is promotional
          services for organizing the company, and thus is non-deductible under
          �� 263-66.</span

          several. What about big suppliers? They�ll do the same thing. They�ll
          say that you must have a signed, written joint and several guarantee

          >Here is an anomaly: what�s the tax effect of debt when it goes bad?
          There is an odd set of rules that we�ll look at tomorrow. One of the
          ironies is that often, for a closely-held company, investing in common
          or preferred stock is better than taking a note. Here�s a hypo:
          Daughter runs a non-Sub S company. It�s breaking even and it�s been
          around for 7-8 years. She needs to expand now. She turns to Father and
          wants him to buy 100,000 shares of stock. What considerations go into
          it? First off, look at it from a practical standpoint. Father is a
          retired physics professor with a good pension. He�s well-to-do but not
          wealthy. Suppose that Daughter is his only child and he�s not married
          now. Say he can rake up over $100,000. One of the problems will be
          that Daughter and her co-investors will be more interested in their
          salaries than dividends. That�s understandable! Could Father make out
          well? Sure! The company could do well. It could get bought out by a
          big public company. Does Father want to be a director or an officer?
          No way! He doesn�t want to be liable! What about the downside? On this
          hypo, if he invests and the company goes under, he�ll get an ordinary
          business loss under � 1244, whereas if he
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">lent</i> the money to the
          company and they went under, then � 463-66 would only give him a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">capital</i> loss. � 1244 is a
          sometimes useful <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">oddity</i>. It
          gives a limit for a single person. Lastly, you would tell him that his
          potential for liability is quite low if he doesn�t try to run things,
          and isn�t an employee, officer, or director. This is called �disregard
          of the corporate fiction�. As long as he�s not active, he�s probably
          safe. But should he do it? He should consider his health. If he might
          get sick, he better hold onto his money.</span

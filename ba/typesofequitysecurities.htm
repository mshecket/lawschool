          different <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">classes</i> of
          shares. Each class must have something that makes it different from
          the other classes, and all the shares within one class must have the
          same rights. If there is only one class of shares issued, they may be
          called �common shares�, �capital shares�, or just �shares� or
          �stock�.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Preferred shares</i> have some
          rights that are preferential to common shares, but they are also
          limited. The preferred shares may have the right to a certain amount
          of money before the common shares get any money, but at the same time
          these shares are non-voting. If the company screws up in certain ways,
          though, the preferred shares can get voting power. Preferred shares
          basically are higher in the pecking order in terms of who gets
          dividends or distributions first. Dividends are paid out of earnings
          to shareholders. Distributions, on the other hand, are paid out of
          capital. There are special rules for distributions, but not
          necessarily for dividends. Shareholders have other, non-financial
          rights too.</span

        <span
          >These shares get cumulative dividend rights, which basically means
          that if you don�t pay out dividends to preferred shareholders for a
          few years, you have to sort of make back payments of dividends to them
          before you can make any dividend payments to the common shareholders.
          These shares usually don�t have voting rights except under certain
          special circumstances like when preferred dividends haven�t been paid
          for a certain amount of time. If the corporation dissolves, the
          preferred shareholders will have a shot at the proceeds from selling
          the company�s assets before the common shareholders get it.</span

        <span
          >Preferred shares can be made redeemable by the corporation, meaning
          the corporation can buy back the shares at a fixed price and the
          shareholder must accept. The redemption price is typically made higher
          than the specified amount of money the preferred shareholder is
          entitled to if the corporation dissolves. Preferred shares can
          sometimes be made convertible into regular old common shares at the
          option of the shareholder. The conversion ratio is set such that it�s
          not worthwhile to convert the preferred shares unless the common
          shares appreciate in value quite a lot.</span

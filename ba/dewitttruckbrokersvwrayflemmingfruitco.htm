        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Flemming�s company worked as a middleman between farmers and
          purchasers of fruit. Flemming paid the plaintiff trucking company to
          transport fruit. Flemming assured the trucking company that he would
          guarantee to pay them back even if his corporation didn�t. Flemming
          didn�t pay them in time, and the trucking company sued Flemming
          personally. Flemming tried to argue that he wasn�t personally liable,
          but instead only the corporation was liable. The trucking company, on
          the other hand, argued that they should be able to �pierce the
          corporate veil� so they could make Flemming personally liable. The
          district court found for the plaintiffs and Flemming appealed.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the district court correctly find that it was appropriate to
          �pierce the corporate veil� and make Flemming liable for the debts of
          his corporation?</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          When a person owns basically all the stock in a corporation, plus some
          other factors are present such as a lack of corporate formalities,
          undercapitalization and non-payment of dividends, or if the
          corporation is more or less a fa�ade for an individual, the
          corporation may be disregarded for the purposes of liability and the
          dominant stockholder may be held liable.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          Flemming owned most of the stock. He never had a shareholder meeting,
          and he was the only real director. No one except Flemming ever got
          paid by the corporation. Flemming kept withdrawing whatever money the
          corporation had for his personal use. The corporation basically had no
          capital of its own. Given all this, plus Flemming�s personal assurance
          to the plaintiff creditor, the appellate court has no problem
          upholding the district court�s findings of fact.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The district court is upheld and Flemming is held personally liable
          for the debt.</span

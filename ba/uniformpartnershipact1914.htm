        <span
          >The need for uniform laws on partnerships as more and more interstate
          businesses sprouted up. These businesses not only did business in
          multiple states, but also had owners in multiple states. The
          commissioners also wanted to eliminate much of the uncertainty and
          theoretical inconsistency in the cases from different states. Finally,
          the committee wanted to provide authoritative guidance on how
          partnerships were to lawfully run their affairs, and how to properly
          end the partnership when the time comes.</span

          The law of agency is still good, so check your Restatement. (4) When
          you interpret these statutes, do it in a way so that they�ll be

      <p>
        <span
          >� 25 � A partner co-owns the specific partnership property as a
          tenant in partnership. Each partner can possess partnership property
          for partnership use only. But with the consent of all the other
          partners, any one partner can use partnership property for other
          purposes. (I�m imagining if the partnership owned a beachfront condo
          for entertaining clients, but one of the partners wanted to use it in
          the <span class="SpellE">offseason</span> for personal use. They could
          if all the partners agreed to let them.) Individual partners can�t
          assign their interest in the ownership of specific partnership
          property. You can�t attach or execute a partner�s right in specific
          property. You can only attach property as to the partnership as a
          whole. When a partner dies, the right to the specific partnership
          property is divided up among the surviving partners. The partner�s
          right in specific partnership property isn�t subject to various
          personal encumbrances.</span

          the right to receive profits, not the right to participate in
          management of the partnership. If the partnership dissolves, the
          assignee can then get an account of the partnership and whatever their

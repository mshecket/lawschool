<p><span>The
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> case in the 1880’s against Rockefeller and his
trusts were the source of the term “antitrust”. There are several federal antitrust statutes (such as the Sherman
Antitrust Act), and in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> we have the Valentine Act. Tomorrow, we’ll cover ultra vires and read
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Litwin </i>case. In that case, we’ll find that what the
officers and directors did was contrary to the bank’s charter. The plaintiffs’ shareholder derivative action
had two counts: (1) negligence and (2) ultra vires. The plaintiffs claimed that since what the
officers and directors did was ultra vires, they had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>liability without fault</i> (i.e. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strict
liability</i>). The court said that the plaintiffs
had it wrong. They said that in the corporation
area if what an officer or director does is ultra vires, it’s not strict
liability, but rather <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>evidence of negligence</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
did the plaintiff make the argument that he did? In the trust area, if you’re a trustee or an
executor or administrator of an estate, and you do something ultra vires, the
trust rule generally <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> that of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>absolute liability without fault</i>. That rule is related to a rule on conflicts
of interest. Unless a trust instrument
provides otherwise, a trustee who sells stock to the trust which later goes
down in value has absolute liability. Fault need not be shown. In the corporate
world, if (1) a conflict of interest is fully and fairly disclosed up front,
(2) there’s no injury to creditors and (3) what the director or officer did was
reasonable then there is a defense. It
can be hard to show those three things.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
is there a difference between the corporate arena and the law of trust? The law of trust and executors and
administrators is designed to deal with the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>conservation
of capital</i>, and the law of business associations deals with the same
thing. However, the law of business
associations is more entrepreneurial in that it also takes into consideration
reasonable risk taking and growth of capital. We’ll see this again in Wills, Trusts, and Estates. The ultra vires stuff is important. What is the lawyer’s role? What are their possible liabilities?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
a major corporate transaction, the third party dealing with the corporation
will usually ask his counsel <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> the
lawyer for the corporation whether the contract has been <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>duly and validly adopted </i>by the corporation and is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>binding </i>on the corporation in accordance
with the terms of the contract. This
includes, if needed, the approval of the board of directors, and, if needed,
the approval of shareholders, but most transactions, even if fairly large, don’t
require board and/or shareholder approval. The officers of the company can do a lot by themselves. We will see more on the authority of
officers. The lawyer will have to draw
up a memo saying whether <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shareholder
approval </i>is needed, whether it has been <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>obtained</i>,
if the shareholders are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entitled to
appraisal rights</i>, whether you need the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>approval
of the board of directors</i>, whether there has been a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>validly called meeting</i>, whether <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>papers
have been circulated</i>, whether you have the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>right vote</i>, and finally whether the officers <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>have the authority </i>to do what they’re purported to do.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
attorney for the corporation may want to strike the word “duly” and leave “validly”. The two terms are not synonyms! If they were synonymous, they wouldn’t both
be used. “Validly” means that “the holy
water may not have been sprinkled on right, but it’s still a valid transaction.” When you add “duly”, it means that it’s been
performed “in a way that would please a grand hall monitor, superintendent of
an authoritarian school; square corners have been turned and everything has
been done right.” You have to get the
right papers at closing! You can have
big headaches in court in the future, even if you win!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the last 15 years, the Silverado accords have become a big deal. Some lawyers had a retreat and talked about
how opinions ought to be worded. If you’re
asked to give an opinion subject to the Silverado accords, don’t sign it right
away! Double check the definitions! They’re “wacky!” Careful lawyers will add reservations related
to environmental laws, RICO, equity orders, and doctrines of good faith and
commercial reasonableness. They will
also add a section dealing with fraudulent conveyance statutes. “They are murder!” Sometimes you can’t get around this stuff,
though. To limit costs, sometimes the
other side will accept an opinion of the corporate counsel if, to the best of
their knowledge (not having audited or anything like that), “X, Y, and Z are
true”. Then there will be a paragraph
that describes when the firm is on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>notice</i>
of certain facts. The point is that this
is tough stuff. In opinions, you’ll
always have to consider ultra vires.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Some
big limiting factors on corporate power are loan agreements, mortgages, notes,
and other instruments that you’ve signed with creditors. The other side will ask for an opinion saying
that these old agreements don’t run against the new one. So ultra vires is a big deal! Pay attention to it! It’s very important in practice!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Organizing the company</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
naming of corporations and LLCs is getting sticky! It’s mostly a matter of state law, but not
entirely. There are two or three things
you can do. In most states, you can pay
$10 or $15 to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reserve a name</i> for
30-60 days. Shipman says this is
wise! It makes sure that no one else has
a name similar to what you’re reserving. What if you’re a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> company and you want to
come in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> such that in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, your name doesn’t
conflict, but in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> it does? Let’s say your name in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> is “XYZ Inc.” We look at </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>assumed name statute</i>. You
get an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overstamp</i>. You basically say: “We are actually XYZ, Inc.,
a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Pennsylvania</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> corporation. But in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, we’re <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>doing business as </i>Smith, Inc.” If you think you’ll do business in several states, reserve the name
quickly because names are important. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, if a general partnership
owns land, then unless the names of all the partners are in the firm name, the partnership
must file an assumed name certificate, which is enforced when you go to sell
land: if you haven’t done it, you can’t sell!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Trademarks,
service marks, and trade dress overlap with local statutes somewhat. There is also the Lanham Act that allows many
of these suits to be brought in federal court. These statutes are distant relatives of the patent and copyright statutes. They’re sort of types of intellectual
property statutes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
all states, when you authorize the issuance of stock, you must describe it as
either common or preferred stock and you must give the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>par value</i> for the stock. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, by a recent amendment, you
can name the initial directors in the articles of incorporation. It used to be the case that there was an incorporators
meeting, and essentially things got complicated. So the new, simpler method is better. Also, in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, you’ll have to have a shareholders’
meeting early on because only the shareholders can adopt the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>permanent regulation</i>s.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Regulations and bylaws</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
we call regulations in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> are called bylaws
everywhere else, including </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the shareholders must
adopt the permanent regulations with a couple of minor exceptions found in the statute. That’s populist. At the other extreme, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Indiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> requires the directors to
propose and the shareholders to vote upon any proposal to amend the bylaws. That means shareholders acting by themselves
cannot amend the bylaws! Well, what’s in
the middle? </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, which is very
complicated. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Either</i> the directors or shareholders may, at a meeting properly
called with proper notice, adopt or amend bylaw provisions. However, the board of directors can’t tinker
with what the shareholders have done.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and two other states, the shareholders,
acting alone, can also amend the articles of incorporation! That’s virtually unheard outside of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and a couple of other
states. That’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>very </i>populist. Shipman
thinks it’s right. We’re also one of the
few states where shareholders, acting alone, can vote to dissolve the corporation. We’re only one or two or three states where
that’s true.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
a lot of work in advance that goes into forming a corporation. There are tax factors, licensing, zoning,
permits, bank account forms, insurance, and all kinds of other things. “The biggie not covered yet in the casebook
is compliance with </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and federal securities
laws.” We’ll get to that soon.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Lastly,
all states have provisions concerning <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>foreign
corporation</i> (meaning out-of-state) qualifying to do business in that state,
e.g. R.C. Chapter 1703. Why do we have
these? (1) They’re a big aid to the tax
authorities to know who to tax. (2) One
of the requirements of these statutes is to designate a registered agent for
service of process. Let’s say a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> corporation has its main
offices in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York City</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. If it’s subject to Chapter 1703, they must
file a consent to service of process. They
will often name a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>corporation service
company</i>, such as CT Corp. They must
also have a registered office in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. CT Corp. can provide that for them too.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
do people resist this so much? The
consent to service of process statutes don’t stop with torts in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, but govern torts
worldwide! If you’re a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> corporation with your main
office in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and you’re qualified to do business
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> but also do business in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, you can be sued in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>! But how do these statutes fare under the Dormant
Commerce Clause? The U.S. Supreme Court
has held that if there is some kind of business operation, like an office or
store or property or mine in the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, then that breaks the chain
of interstate commerce enough for </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to regulate the business. If the corporation simply mails things into </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, then even though </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> courts would have jurisdiction
over that company in a products liability case, the Dormant Commerce Clause
precludes Chapter 1703 from applying.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Bendix</span></i><span> was a case regarding Chapter
1703 and also a separate <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tolling </i>statute
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. That statute
says if a defendant in an action has been out of the state, then in computing
whether the statute of limitations has run, you “carve out” the period of absence
and don’t count that. For example, a plaintiff’s
medical malpractice usually has a 12 month statute of limitations. If the guy comes in to see you 12 months and
two weeks after the event, but the doctor was out of the state for three weeks
during that period, then the statute of limitations hasn’t tolled! You’re still timely! Wherever you’re taking advantage of a tolling
statute, the plaintiff must plead a good prima facie case for tolling or else
they’ll get booted out on summary judgment!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So Bendix
was an </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> corporation that delivered equipment to an </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> vendee and installed it in
the vendee’s plant. Chapter 1703 exempts
that from having to qualify to do business in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Four years and two months later, a fraud suit
against Bendix was started in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> courts. (Remember that delivering and installing
machinery constitutes minimum contacts if there’s a long-arm statute!) Also remember that the plaintiff’s complaint
must clearly plead why he is within the statute of limitations. The vendee said that based on the absence statute,
the company could have qualified to do business in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, but they <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>didn’t</i> qualify to do business in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and thus they’re absent
from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>! But Justice
Kennedy held that the statute was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>discriminatory
</i>against interstate commerce, and the tolling statute was knocked down. With the tolling statute knocked down, the
general </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> four-year fraud statute of limitations booted the
vendee out of court! The question is:
why the heck did they wait that long? There’s malpractice somewhere. So
unless you can find a compelling state interest to justify the restriction on interstate
commerce, the statute goes down as unconstitutional!</span></p>

<p><b><span>Pre-incorporation contracts –
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a href="stanleyjhownassocincvboss.htm">Stanley
J. How &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Boss</a></i></span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
involved here? Check out the signature
lines! Ed Boss signs for a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> corporation that hasn’t
been formed yet! The corporation is to
be the obligor. But the corporation <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>isn’t formed</i> and there’s a suit by the
architect against the promoter. This
case represents the majority view in American law. It’s even more the majority view under
English law. How come? It’s an axiom of agency law that if there is
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-existent principal</i> and the
agent knows it, and the agent signs on behalf of the non-existent principal,
then the agent is absolutely liable. Does this seem harsh? Courts want
someone liable on the contract. They don’t
want legal “airballs” out there. Is
there American authority to the contrary? Yes, in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Quaker Hill</i> case
in the notes, the vendor <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>twisted the
promoter’s arm</i>, and the promoter signed the way that Boss did. They found that the usual rule was not fair
under those facts. But that’s a minority
rule.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
happens if the corporation is formed? If
the corporation is formed and you have a highly formal document, namely, a
3-way novation agreement, then it will clearly be valid. A novation is a recognized “animal” of contract
law. But things usually aren’t that
simple!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McArthur</i> case talks about
ratification and adoption, which are agency terms both in tort and in contract. In torts, we learn that even if there is no
authorization up front and even if respondeat superior doesn’t apply, if the principal
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ratifies</i> the tort afterwards, then
you may sue the actual tortfeasor <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
the principal. For example, if you’re a
bus company superintendent and a driver comes in saying: “I socked this dude on
the bus to teach him a lesson because he was annoying me”, and then the
superintendent says: “I woulda hit him three times”, then that is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied ratification</i>, and the company
will be liable. Ratification can be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
does this come up in the context of pre-incorporation contracts? In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McArthur</i>,
we’re in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> in the 1880’s. First off, the promoter and employee orally agree on a 14 month employee
contract. On April 2, the corporation is
formed and the board of directors meets. They have knowledge of the oral contract of employment made by the
promoter in January. They approve! Then, on July 2, the employee is dismissed
without cause. The employee sues for damages
against the corporation. It’s not an
action for specific performance! It’s a
legal action.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
wrong here? In the old days, and the new
days in some states, partial performance doesn’t take a contract outside of the
statute of frauds. At the time, there
was no strong partial performance doctrine! The employee says that this was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ratified</i>
by the board of directors, and therefore the corporation is bound. The corporation gives two defenses: (1) under
British law and many American states, if the principal was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not in existence </i>when the agent made the contract, then there can
be no ratification because the ratification relates back to the original event,
and there was no corporation in existence on that date! Besides, if you relate it back to that date,
you’re in violation of the statute of frauds! So this seems like a good argument. But what the court held was that there is a separate of related doctrine
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>adoption</i>, and that the board could
not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ratify </i>on April 2, but it <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could</i> “hop over one compartment” and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>adopt</i>, which doesn’t relate back to
January 2. When we put the day at April
2, there are 11 months to go, and there is no statute of frauds problem. The doctrine of restitution would apply to
any corporation that is formed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about the lawyer who does the work of bringing a corporation into
existence? Does the lawyer have a right
to get paid when the corporation is born? The cases are split. Let’s say
Peter Promoter walks into your office with his wife, Paula. They want to promote a company and it will
take a lot of complicated and detailed work. Can a lawyer represent both of them? You have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dual clients</i>. Under Canons 5, 4, and 9 of the Ohio Code of
Professional Responsibility, you must warn them (1) of the potential conflicts
between them, (2) that there is no strict attorney-client privilege and that
what one tells you can be discovered by the other, and (3) that there would be
advantages to each one having their separate attorney. If, knowing this, they still want you to
represent them, that’s fine, with a major caveat: on every major matter, you
would have to stop and explain how the major matter is favorable and
unfavorable to each client. It’s a same
thing when a married couple comes in and wants you to craft both their
wills. This can get hairy!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
a widely used hypo from CLE symposia: H &amp; W come in and want you to draft
both of their wills. The ordinary will
is fully revocable until the person dies and/or goes crazy (AKA “lose mental
capacity”). You draft the wills, and
married couples will usually leave to each other. Three months later, W calls, saying that she
wants a new will drafted leaving everything to her lover. So the first question is whether you can do
that. Of course you can’t! What else do you have to do? At a bare minimum, you must phone the husband
and tell him, at minimum, that you can no longer represent him vis-à-vis the
will, that you’re no longer representing the wife, and that he should
immediately go to a new lawyer to make a new will revoking the old one. You also have to tell the wife that you can
no longer represent her at all. Representing joint clients can get sticky! Some say you have to tell H about the
lover. Shipman supposes they’ll get the
message when you tell them to go get a new lawyer and a new will. What if the husband says, “Why are you
telling me this?” You want to make sure
that nobody gets killed. Later, we’ll
talk about quasi-clients in the corporate area: they’re not quite joint
clients, but you incur the same duties. There are also third-party non-clients who are in privity of contract
with you, for example: if you represent a corporation selling Greenacre to a
third-party, and that party wants your opinion that the contract is cool, and
you address the opinion to that party, that is a third-party non-client who is
in privity with you. You can be liable
in negligence on the opinion to him!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
a hypo we were supposed to think about: Mrs. Smith wants to buy some land for a
corporation that hasn’t been formed yet. She doesn’t want the land for herself, but only for the corporation. Can she assure that the land is available if
she forms the corporation? She’s not
sure if she can get loan from her husband and parents. We’ll represent Smith and the corporation but
not anybody else because the conflicts are too strong. From <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="stanleyjhownassocincvboss.htm">Stanley J. How</a></i>, we find that a contract
between the corporation to be formed and the owner would leave her holding the
bag if the corporation <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>isn’t</i>
formed. The thing to do is to pay the
guy to have an option running a few weeks. The option states that it may be assigned to a corporation to be
formed. If the formation of the corporation
goes ahead, she assigns the option to the corporation for the cost of the
option. If the corporation doesn’t get
formed, she’s only out a few hundred dollars for the cost of the option.</span></p>

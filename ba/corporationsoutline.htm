<b>Not-for-profit corporations</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Not-for-profit corporations will not have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shareholders</i>, they will have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>members</i>. The people who run the not-for-profit will be called <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directors </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>trustees</i>. Below them will be
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>officers</i>. Beneath them will be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>non-officer executives</i>. And
below that, you have “the people who actually do the work”. There will be creditors in a not-for-profit
corporation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At the end of §§ 1701 and 1702, they both state the
following: “§ 1701 applies to corporations formed under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>other</i> chapters (e.g. § 1702), except to the extent that § 1702 is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inconsistent</i> with § 1701, in which event
you go to § 1702.” Is it always to
determine when there is inconsistency? No. Go to § 1702, and you’ll find
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mirror image of that</i>. It says: “In construing this chapter,
construe it with § 1701, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>except</i> if §
1701 is inconsistent, in which case use this statute.” The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>specific
trumps the general every time</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The NYSE is organized as a <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
not-for-profit corporation. All
not-for-profit corporations have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>members</i>
who elect <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directors</i> or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>trustees</i>. They don’t have shareholders, but they do
have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>creditors</i>. There are two big subdivisions of
not-for-profit corporations: (1)
Charitable, religious, educational and corporations for the prevention of
cruelty to animals – The most favored not-for-profits are those that meet
Internal Revenue Code § 501(c)(3). To
gain this status, you must file papers with the IRS in advance to convince them
that you’re charitable. One requirement
is that no insider can have an undue right to the income or assets of the
foundation. In practice, that means that
the promoter can be a trustee, director, or president and can collect a
reasonable salary and benefits, including a reasonable salary plan. Some people who run charitable corporations
get good money! If you are a charitable
organization, you’re governed by ordinary state corporation law and also the
law of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charitable trusts</i>. If you’re a § 1702 charitable corporation,
you’ll be governed by both § 1702 and § 1701 (to the extent that it’s not
inconsistent), and also by the law of charitable trusts. If you’re going to start a charitable
organization, though, do it under § 1702. If you get into a dispute over trust law, you’ll have to go to a
treatise. Under § 503(c)(3), you’re
exempt from federal income taxation. You’re also exempt from most federal excise taxes. You can also get an exemption from real
property taxes! But that’s not the end
of the financial feast! Under IRC § 170,
within certain percentage limits, donors making donations to you get a federal
income tax deduction. (2) Non-charitable
not-for-profits – § 503(c)(6) describes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>business
leagues</i>, which provide <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i> tax
breaks, but not nearly as many as if you are a § 501(c)(3).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc76297492"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Business (or for-profit) corporations</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, these
are governed primarily by § 1701. The
promoter wants a vehicle that he can (1) raise money with (to entice inactive
investors to put their money in), (2) can control (the promoter wants to
control the board of directors because it will determine who the officers and
highly paid employees are and who gets the fringe benefits), and (3) if things
go to hell he can minimize his liability (subject to qualified exceptions for
disregard of the corporate fiction; but the inactive investor seldom gets
reached). Who can be tapped (that is,
who will be liable) if things go wrong? What about deadlock?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297493"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The corporate family tree</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Investors </i>are
people who invest money in the corporation. “Money to a corporation is like blood to humans: without it, you
die.” <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Creditors </i>(e.g. owners of company bonds) take first upon <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dissolution</i>. Dissolution has a different context in a
corporate situation than in a partnership situation: it means <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>termination of legal existence</i>. Creditors take first, and if there’s anything
left, then the equity investors take what’s left.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>All investors other than creditors are called <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equity investors</i>, for example, owners of
common or preferred stock. Upon
dissolution, a preferred stock owner takes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>after</i>
creditors but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>before</i> common
stock. We will study a little bit about
options on equity in this course, primarily options on common stock. Options are used primarily in the context of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>executive stock options</i>, which we’ll
study closely. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>But</i>, the term has a broader application. A <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>warrant</i>
is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>long-term </i>option that is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>transferable</i>. For a few companies in this country, there
are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perpetual warrants</i> out there that
are occasionally traded on the stock exchange. Executive stock options are nearly always <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>non-transferable</i>, with one exception. If you die, your beneficiaries get the option
and usually will have the opportunity to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exercise</i>
the option if they want to.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Voting</i>
stockholders elect the directors. There
are also non-voting classes of stock in most states, including both <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directors</i>
have several jobs. The most important
one is the hiring and firing of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>officers</i>. Officers are very high-level management
employees with a formal legal title: “executive vice president” or
whatever. The other roles of the
directors are to pass major transactions, to monitor the officers, and to set
long-range plans and policies. The
directors are advised by lawyers, CPAs, management consultants, and investment
bankers.</p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc76297494"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Securities</b></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Corporate securities determine, among other things, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>who controls</i> (that is, who elects
directors), which in turn controls <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>who
gets the good jobs</i> (since the directors choose the officers), and also what
cash flow will go to the shareholders. The most junior equity (usually common stock) captures the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>upside</i>. It is invariably the common stock that elects directors. Sometimes you’ll see voting preferred stock,
but not all that often, so we’ll call common stock the most junior.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If a company sells its assets and is liquidated and it’s
paying off its security holders, creditors take first, preferred stockholders
take second, and common stockholders take third. Those most junior stockholders will get <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nothing</i> unless the creditors and common
stockholders are satisfied in whole. On
the other hand, the holder of a fully secured mortgage note (the most senior
debt) is the most protected when the downside comes. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The unsecured creditors, that is, the
creditors with no lien, often take nothing or close to nothing in bankruptcy
because the secured creditors may have placed first mortgages on almost
everything.</p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p>The first version of R.C. Chapter 1707 was passed in 1913. The first state statute was in <st1:State><st1:place>Kansas</st1:place></st1:State>
in 1912. The Kansas Secretary of State
that the farmers were being sold “so many pieces of the blue sky”. This is why we call state securities statutes
“Blue Sky” statutes. There is a CCH
“Blue Sky” Reporter. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The state statutes
provide for registration of securities at R.C. 1707.09, which in effect says
that unless exempt, every person must first register every security before you
offer it for sale in that state. The
exemptions in the Ohio Act are found in R.C. 1707.02 and .03. In the Securities Act of 1933 you’ll find the
same stuff in § 3, 4, and 5. Just before
World War I, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state “Blue
Sky” statutes. So R.C. Chapter 1707 has
a “don’t breathe” clause, and then exemptions like .02(E).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A security listed on any major stock exchange or listed on
the national market system of NASDAQ is exempt from registration by
everybody. But there is no comparable
thing in the federal statutes. If GM
makes a public offering, they will have to register just like a startup
company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>But that’s not the end of the
story. A big public company like GM can
use a shorter registration form and, in fact, their offering will go through
faster than an IPO because the SEC is very aware of GM and its reputation for
high solvency. Broker-dealers must
register under R.C. 1707.14. Court cases
have held that if you have more than an incidentally small number of
transactions, you’re <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in the business</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In R.C. 1707.13, there is a substantive fairness
provision. If the commissioner can find
that the securities are to be sold on grossly unfair terms, he can stop
it. There is no similar provision
federally. But if you try to register
federally and it’s a real screwjob, then the SEC will delay you forever. In R.C. 1707.29, .44 and .45 are criminal
provisions. .44 reads like a regular
high-scienter criminal statute. But .29
says that if you claim that you don’t have scienter because you didn’t have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knowledge</i> but if a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>reasonable investigation</i> would have produced such knowledge, then
you are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>presumed</i> to have known what
you would have learned from a reasonable investigation. In other words, ordinary negligence is the
mens rea! R.C. 1707.38-.45 deals with civil
liability.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The first federal statute was the Securities Act of
1933. This deals with public offerings
by companies and their <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>affiliates</i>. That usually includes directors, high
officers, and anyone who is a controlling person. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 deals
more with broker-dealers, stock exchanges, the trading markets and the
NASD. Just what is the NASD? It’s a Delaware-chartered not-for-profit
company subject to heavy SEC oversight which governs the “over-the-counter”
(that is, not on a stock exchange) markets. The NASD runs <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quotation systems</i>. There is a national market system which is
automated. There are also <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other</i> automated systems, the most
prominent being the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bulletin board</i>. The smaller public companies in <st1:place>Central
 Ohio</st1:place> are found on the bulletin board. They also have the “sheets”, that used to be
mimeographed, but now they’re more electronic. Excluding mutual funds, there are only 14,000 public companies. There are 8,000 mutual funds. That’s out of several million business associations
in the country. How did the NYSE come
about? They started out under a tree,
then they got a building.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The first question with regard to any federal securities act
is whether it is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>security</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Smith v. Gross</i> –
Here was an entrepreneur selling earthworms. Earlier cases had held that if you buy cattle from an entrepreneur and
he keeps and feeds them for you, then that is an investment contract. But if you take care of your own cattle they
are not securities. Smith brought a suit
under § 12(a)(1) under the Securities Act of 1933 for rescission. That statute says that if you should have
registered but didn’t, the investor can rescind and get his money back. Of course, the investor will only rescind
when the stock goes down! So we have a
suit against the vendor of the earthworms. There was clearly a public offering here and Regulation D was not
complied with. There was no registration
statement. But, of course, if there is
no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>security</i>, then there is no
recovery under the Securities Act of 1933. They said that the cattle cases aren’t applicable. The court held that the only market for
earthworms was the entrepreneur buying them back when they grew up, but that’s
still an investment contract and therefore there could be a rescission.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Securities and
Exchange Comm’n v. Ralston Purina Co. </i>– If an issuer makes a private
offering, it will be exempt. This is
called statutory § 4(2). It can apply to
any kind of company. There is no dollar
limit on statutory § 4(2). You also
don’t need to file notice with the SEC in order to perfect the exemption. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
the statute is .03(Q), and you do have to file to perfect the exemption. If you meet either statutory 4(2) or .03(Q),
you can pay the fee and do it. There is
a tricky statute in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> that is .03(O),
which doesn’t require filing. So you
define what the offering is, which involves “come to rest” and
“integration”. In this case, neither
party was arguing with the other over these two issues. This case involved no charge of fraud or
unfairness.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The company was a very prosperous NYSE company in <st1:City><st1:place>St.
  Louis</st1:place></st1:City> that generally had stock of increasing value
from 1941 on. They could have filed a
short form with the SEC, but they didn’t. The S-8 is limited to public companies and its employee stock options. That wasn’t used. What remedy does the SEC seek? They only want an injunction forcing the
company to file. This is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>a criminal proceeding. The company picked out employees who they
thought were up and coming, and they offered stock in the company to them. The people who were picked out ranged from
the deck foreman to the President and CEO with a lot inbetween. It was a broad group of people. In the 1930’s, the SEC general counsel had
issued his opinion that once you define what the offering is, if the number is
25 or fewer, there will nearly always be an exemption from registration. If the number is 26 or greater, it will not
be a private offering. The Supreme Court
looked at the legislative history and found a congressional statement saying
that generally speaking, if you make a public offering to employees it’s like a
public offering to anyone.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Court could have gone either of two ways: (1) it could
have accepted the SEC rule of thumb, saying that the company was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>way</i> over the 25 number, and thus there
was no private officer. (2) It could
have said that the SEC could have its own rule of thumb, but that’s not binding
on the courts. The latter is what they
actually said. The test for determining
whether it’s public or not is the “needs to be served” test. If the people <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>need</i> the protections of a registration statement (which will
contain a prospectus) then whether it is to few or many offerees, it’s a public
officer. Justice Clark tried to get more
specific, saying that if the offering were limited to people who could “fend
for themselves” and all of those people have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>access </i>(emphasis on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>access</i>)
to information that a registration statement would provide, then it is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-public</i> regardless of the numbers
involved. In other words, in this particular
case, had the offering been limited to the ten top officers in <st1:City><st1:place>St.
  Louis</st1:place></st1:City>, it would have been fine because those ten
people can “fend for themselves” and they had access to the information that a
statement could provide.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Wall Street law firms interpreted the case as saying
that we can go further if Chrysler wants to sell its 5 year notes to the 150
biggest banks in the country, they put together a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>private placement memorandum </i>containing the essential financial,
accounting, and narrative statements and they hold a meeting giving top
representatives from those banks access to management to ask questions, then
even though there are 150 offerees then it’s private. That’s the only good news from this case.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Justice Clark’s last point was that the burden of pleading
and proving an exemption is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>totally</i>
upon the proponent of the exemption. That’s also true in R.C. 1707.38-.45. Later Fifth Circuit cases made it clear that the proponent of the
exemption had to come into court with the list of the exact names of every
offeree and further proof that nobody else was approached and show that each of
those met the “needs to be served” test. Those Fifth Circuit cases were <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>awful</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ralton Purina</i>
established, among other things, that with all exemptions the burden of
pleading and proof in every detailed respect falls upon the claimant of the
exemption. R.C. 1707.38-.45 establishes
the same thing in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. Both federally and in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
the fact that you’re exempt from registration doesn’t exempt you from <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>express</i> civil liabilities. For example, R.C. 1707.38-.45 apply equally as to registered
transactions as they do to exempt transactions.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>State law is often more demanding than federal law. For example, R.C. 1707.29 and .44-.45, in a
criminal case, make a defendant far more vulnerable than in a federal criminal
prosecution. The major case on the
subject is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>State v. Warner</i> out of the
Ohio Supreme Court from the 1980’s. The
court held that R.C. 1707.29 means what it says: the mens rea element in a
criminal prosecution under R.C. 1707.29 is simply <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ordinary negligence</i>. Federally, the mens rea element is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>willfulness</i>,
which has been construed as a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very high
burden</i> on the federal government.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How much does federal law preempt state law? The short answer is some but not much. In the 1990’s, there were three big federal
statutes. First, in 1996, there was
NSMIA, or the National Securities Markets Improvements Act. This Act has several preemptive
provisions. As to investment advisors,
the federal government takes over primary regulation of the big ones and the
states take over primary regulation of the little ones. As a result, in the 1990’s, <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
passed an investment advisors act that covers financial planners. NSMIA also says that if a company is listed
on a major exchange or on the national market system of the NASD, no state can
require registration of the issuance of securities by that company. It reads just like R.C. 1707.02(E) in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. Before this federal Act, several states like <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>
did not exempt nationally-listed corporations from registration. Only the state of incorporation can deal with
alleged securities and fiduciary duty violations. As to mutual funds, certain things were
reserved to the SEC, while the states can do certain other things. We’ll later discuss the provision dealing
with Rule 506.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In 1998, an act was passed that says with respect to certain
fraud and other suits they will become subject to the 1995 federal act (which
was very pro-defendant). If they are in
state court, they are to be removed to federal court where the defendant
advantages of the 1995 Act apply. There
is a big exception, though. In an action
for breach of fiduciary duty under the law of the state of incorporation, the
1998 Act doesn’t apply, and if the plaintiff’s lawyer is careful in drafting,
you can avoid the 1995 Act. In <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>CTS</i> from the U.S. Supreme Court in the
1980’s, the Court said that regulation of tender offers by the states must be
reasonable and limited and if they are not reasonable and limited then they
will be preempted.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So there is some federal preemption but not a heck of a
lot. Common law remedies are not
displaced by federal or state securities laws and are the best more often than
you think!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Under the federal securities
laws, a securities broker must avoid recommending unsuitable securities to
purchasers. There is a remedy under Rule
10(b)(5). Under 10(b)(5), it is only if
the customer proves that the recommendation was made with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>scienter</i>. That’s
hardcore. In a big <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
case, a NYSE member broker-dealer recommended some investments to a customer,
and they went south. The customer said
that given his precarious financial position, they should not have recommended
a speculative security. If he had sued
under 10(b)(5), it would have had to go to federal court because the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 says that all actions under the Act must be in federal
court (which is different from the other federal securities statutes).</p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p>The plaintiff argued that Olde &amp; Co. is a member of the
NYSE and that one of the rules of the NYSE says that every member must “know
thy customer”. The primary purpose of
the rule is to protect the member firm. If a customer doesn’t buy up after he buys, the member firm is
responsible to the party on the other side of the transaction. The court held that under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
common law this created a statutory tort for a negligent failure to observe
suitability, and the plaintiff won! Shipman says that the plaintiff’s attorneys were very smart.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Cases like this will usually go to arbitration. Usually, broker-dealers will force customers
to sign arbitration clauses up front, and usually the broker-dealer insists on
arbitration. We don’t know why they
didn’t do so here! In arbitration,
suitability claims under 10(b)(5) require scienter, at least in theory. But in practice, arbitrators will often give
recovery for mere <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>negligence</i> on the
part of the broker-dealer firm regarding suitability. On the other hand, studies of all massive
arbitration system, like the securities system, indicate that arbitrators tend
not to give lavish or large awards. They
cut down on the amount. They’re more
liberal in giving the plaintiff <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>something</i>,
but the dollar amounts are smaller.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>Some examples of
exemptions</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Around 93% of all transactions are exempt. Let’s go over some of the important
ones. § 4(1) says that if you’re not an
issuer or an underwriter or an affiliate of the company, stock which you
purchase through the organized trading markets will be exempt. For example, I’m contacted by Johnson in <st1:City><st1:place>Dayton</st1:place></st1:City>
who is a physician. Three months ago, he
bought GM stock, registered in his own name, through the NYSE. He is not a director or officer of GM. Neither is his wife or any other
relative. He doesn’t meet the 10% rule,
which is the third way you can be an affiliate. If you add up the GM stock all of his family owns, it’s still well under
10% of the shares outstanding. Insofar
as the Securities Act of 1933 is concerned, he has a § 4(1) exemption. Insofar as <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law is concerned, R.C. 1707.02(E) exempts him. To sell the stock, he will have to sell it through a broker, but he had
to have a brokerage account in order to buy the stock in the first place.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you are an affiliate as defined in Rule 405, you must
construe § 4(1) with § 2(11), which gets tricky. 2(11) defines “underwriter” in terms of a
person taking with a view to distribution. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>United States v. Wolfson</i>
out of the Second Circuit, the court held that in a criminal case the last
sentence of § 2(11) applies not only to the first sentence of § 2(11) but also
to § 4(1), meaning that an affiliate owning stock can sell only in one of only
three ways: (1) The company files a registration statement for him. This happens only once in 10,000 times because
it’s very expensive. (2) As to public
companies, Rule 144 provides a limited, specified exemption that is widely
used. (3) He can make a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-distribution</i>. Look at 2(11)’s first sentence, and you’ll
find the word “distribution”. The SEC
concedes that if an affiliate makes a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-distribution</i>,
4(1) applies to him.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>An affiliate can sell under Rule 144 on the stock exchange
(but there’s a lot of paperwork). He
will get market price for his stock on the exchange. He can legally make a non-distribution in
theory? The SEC says that the term
“distribution” in § 2(11) equals “non-public offering” in § 4(2) as defined by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ralston Purina</i>. He could sell the stock to a big mutual fund
with a legend saying that the taker is buying for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>investment</i> and not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>distribution</i>. The taker cannot sell for one year. If there is full and fair disclosure to the
mutual fund up-front, that would be perfectly legal. However, he won’t do that because he’ll have
to sell at a 15-40% discount. So he’ll
go to the internal general counsel to get the paperwork going to sell and he’ll
sell under Rule 144 at the full market price. So to construe § 4(1) you must construe it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>with</i> § 2(11), <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>United States
v. Wolfson</i>, and Rule 144.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This accounts for the fact that in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, many major investors elect <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> to sit on the board of a company
that they own a lot of stock in. If they
sit on the board of the company, they will be subject to the restrictions of
Rule 144 and Rule 10(b)(5). On the other
hand, let’s say a rich guy in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
wants to buy 4.5% of GM. He can go to
his bank and the bank can purchase in “street name”, and as long as he stays
under 5%, he doesn’t even have to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>surface</i>
under 13(d). He will prefer to remain
anonymous because if that is his only connection to GM and his family owns no
GM stock and he acquired the stock over one year ago on the NYSE, then he can
sell it at any time! If, on the other
hand, he’s on the board, he has all the Rule 144 limits plus, if there is material,
undisclosed and unfavorable information about the company, 10(b)(5) absolutely
precludes him from selling. In <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>,
the big companies all have the big investors on their board. But in this country, a lot of the people who
are big investors prefer to stay off the board. As long as they’re under 10% including family holdings and as long as
they don’t seek out or get inside info, they can sell when they want to and
they can buy when they want to.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Another person that cannot use § 4(1) is someone who has
purchased stock in an exemption and sells before it has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>come to rest</i>. That is why
under Regulation D securities sold under that exemption must be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>legended</i>. In the public trading markets, delivery to
your broker of a legended security is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per
se</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bad delivery</i>! Therefore, if you buy in a 506 offering and
get legended securities, then even if the company is a public company you’ll be
unable to sell the securities until you get the company to issue you a
“squeaky-clean” certificate.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Can a person be both an affiliate and also not meet the
“come to rest” period? Yes. What’s the “come to rest” period? At common law, it is two years. Under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>United
States v. Sherwood</i> out of the Southern District of New York in the 1950’s,
under Rule 144 for a public company the period is cut to one year. Public companies are treated better under the
securities laws in about eight ways.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297495"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Rule 504</b></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The SEC introduction to Regulation D talks about “come to
rest” and integration. Rule 504 is the
“mom and pop” exemption. This exemption
cannot be used by a public company or investment company. There is a dollar limit of $1,000,000. Under all of Regulation D, there can be no <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general advertising</i>. The same is true under § 4(2). If you’re an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
entrepreneur and you’re getting in the car and dropping in on 80 bankers that
you don’t know, that would be construed as general advertising. But if you hire an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
company as your general agent and they deal with these banks all the time and
they send out a fax to them, then it’s okay.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Is Rule 504 a 4(2) rule? That is, is it adopted under 4(2)? No, it’s adopted under § 3(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 which gives
the commission power to adopt exemptions for (1) private offerings and (2)
limited public offerings below a certain number of dollars (currently $5-$7.5
million). Rule 504 is broader in the
sense that it can cover limited public offerings just as R.C. 1707.03(O) can.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about 3(a)(11)? Generally don’t use the 85% rules in Rule 147. 85% of the assets must be in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. 85% of the revenue and profit have to be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>from</i> <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. Only 1 out of 50 times will you meet
that. If you’re organizing a company in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
with its principal place of business in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
but half the business will be done in <st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>. In that case, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>don’t use 3(a)(11)</i>. Also,
like 4(2), 3(a)(11) counts offerees not purchasers, and if there is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>single rotten offeree</i>, either 4(2) or
3(a)(11) is lost forever. This is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Draconian</i>! It’s a financial trap and snare and
sinkhole! Rules 504 and 506 concentrate,
in the main, on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purchasers</i>, who you
can more easily keep account of. Under
504, there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no limit</i> on the
purchasers because it is a limited public offering rule. In 506, there is a limit on purchasers, but
that limit is pretty liberal. But under
Regulation D, there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no general
advertising</i>. That is true in all of
the rules under Regulation D. That’s a
trap!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So Rule 504 is the “mom ‘n’ pop” exception. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
you’ll use R.C. 1707.03(O). Whenever you
can use .03(O) instead of .03(Q), do so, because (O) is easier to satisfy. § 1707.03(O) is limited to equity securities
of a corporation or a limited liability company. What’s an equity security? It’s a stock, warrant, or debt convertible
into stock. What is the counterpart in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
to pure debt? Look for the .02
regulations in a section dealing with commercial paper. There are two sets of .02 regulations. The first one, about 30 years old, says that
despite the wording of the section, it is limited to debt sold to insiders/affiliates. But in the 1990’s, the commissioner expanded
.02, saying that if something is a pure debt security and if it would meet
.03(O) if it were an equity security then it will meet <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>that particular regulation</i>. Another set of <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
regulations that are crucial are the regulations under .03(V). There are some “nice” exemptions there,
including one for certain <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>employee stock
purchase plans</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>employee stock
options</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Federally, Rules 701-703T of the Securities Act of 1933
provide a similar exemption for non-public companies up to a certain dollar
limit. The rules under 701-703T say that
you need not integrate what you sell under these rules with Regulation D. Regulation D makes the same statement. Integration makes your hair go gray in this
area! Why is it restricted to non-public
companies? For non-public companies, the
SEC has a short form, the S-8, for employee stock purchase plans and
options. It’s an easy form to use. Later on we’ll see that employee stock
options and purchase plans are a lot more valuable for public companies than
for private companies. Beginning 25
years ago, executives could make tens of millions of dollars through these
plans. In the 1990’s, this expanded to
up to $1 billion. Jack Welch has a net
worth of around half a billion dollars. So corporate executives can pull a lot of money!</p>

from the one it uses to advise as to the suitability of the investment.</p>

504 has no limit on the number of purchasers because it is a 3(b) rule, that
is, it covers limited public offerings as well as private offerings. But Rule 506 is a 4(2) rule, and the SEC <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does</i> have a limit on number of
purchasers. This is after integration
and “come to rest” are applied. The
number of purchasers in an offering, so defined, may not exceed 35. If you sell 1,000 shares to Mr. Jones and
1,000 shares to his wife, Ms. Smith, that counts as two purchasers. It’s not tenancy in common or joint tenancy
with right of survivorship. The rule
tells us that we use the old view of marriage! The two are one even if the stock is separately titled and separately
paid for by each spouse! The counting
rule is quite liberal. But that’s not
all! What else does the commission have
to help? Each accredited investor counts
as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>zero</i> investors! In other words, you could have 80 accredited
investors plus 20 other people.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This counting rule ties in to 3(c)(1) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, which was the fifth federal securities statute
passed. If you’re an investment company,
there is an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extra strong burdensome level
of registration</i>. The commission was
aiming at mutual funds. However, the
definition of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>investment company</i> is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>much broader</i>. Lawyers are concerned about <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inadvertently</i> becoming an investment
company. But if you’re a bona fide
commercial bank, a bona fide insurance company, a pension or profit-sharing
trust for employees, or a bona fide charitable trust, then you’re exempt. There is also an exemption for a company that
invests in real estate mortgage notes. In Ohio, you may have to file as a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bond
investment company</i>. The big
exemption from this Act is 3(c)(1). This
section says that if a company has fewer than 100 holders and it’s not
presently making a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>public </i>offering,
then it’s exempt. Therefore, if you set
up a partnership that has mainly financial instruments in it, and there are
only 80 partners then if you’re not presently making a public offering, you’ll
be exempt. This directly ties in with
Rule 506 because a 506 offering is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>a
public offering even if there are 70 accredited investors buying.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you have purchasers who are not accredited investors, you
work through Rules 501-503 and find that, for a big offering, you will have to
put together a private placement memorandum that contains <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>just about</i> what a prospectus would contain for a public offering.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
situation? For an offering exempt <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>either</i> under § 4(2) or under Rule 506,
you can get an exemption for the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
portion if you make timely filing and a $100 fee. Each filing is only good for 60 days. If you go for the whole year, you’ll have to
make seven different filings. In the
real world, many exemptions are lost because they’re not careful in getting the
filing there on time. Make sure you have
a stamped copy before the final due date that you can put in your file. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
R.C. 1707.39 and .391 will allow you, in limited circumstances, to file <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>late</i>. <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State> has an even more
advanced scheme. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Federally and generally
under state law, if you miss the deadline you’re dead, and you get strict
liability and malpractice.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What if the private offering crosses state lines? You must make the filings in all states on
time. If it’s an ongoing offering,
you’ll have to make several different filings during the year. If it’s really important that a form be filed
on time, send someone there in person.</p>

<p>As of 1994 and 1995, the high-tech companies in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>,
<st1:place><st1:City>Seattle</st1:City>, <st1:State>Texas</st1:State></st1:place>
and <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State> were using Rule
506 heavily. They were finding that the
various states were questioning their disclosure and were trying to impose
substantive fairness tests. The big
problem was that the suggestions of the various states were <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contradictory</i>; you couldn’t please everyone. So there is a lot of political
dispersion. As a reaction, a part of
NSMIA provides as follows: this applies only as to Rule 506 offerings, and not
to § 4(2). Rule 506 is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>much</i> safer than § 4(2)! Rule 504 is safer still! In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
always use .03(O) in preference to .03(Q) because it is a lot simpler. NSMIA says that states can continue to
require (1) notice filing, (2) a filing fee, (3) application of broker-dealer
rules, (4) application of fraud law, and (5) application of criminal law. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>But </i>the
states shall not, as a matter of routine, question the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>disclosure</i> in a Rule 506 transaction or use their anti-fraud powers
to impose substantive fairness tests. This has worked, and though Shipman is in favor of state regulation, he
thought state variation had gotten out of hand. Another part of NSMIA dealt with broker-dealer rules. It said that a federally registered
broker-dealer can continue to be forced to register under state law. There can be filing fees. Criminal, fraud and injunctive provisions can
be used. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>But</i> in applying selling practice and other rules, such as net
capital, the states can only enforce the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>federal</i>
rules. But can federal courts enforce <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
broker-dealer rules? The Ohio Supreme
Court has held that federal and state regulation must work together closely in
this area.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cockerham v. Cockerham
</i>– The husband had a lot of land before he got married. He married, acquired more land, and under <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>
law what he acquired was community property. The wife went to town and started a dress shop as sole proprietor and
also found another love interest. The
dress shop is going to hell financially. Under <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State> law, Mr.
Cockerham’s community land would have been liable to Mrs. Cockerham’s dress
store debts. But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

able to keep it. So the creditors get to
Mr. Cockerham. He should have said:
“She’s an independent entity. She’s not
my agent. She’s not my partner.” But of course, this macho guy said: “Don’t
worry if her debts aren’t paid off by her! If they aren’t paid off by her, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I’ll</i>

farms, that is, the land that he owned when he got married, <i

was available to the wife’s creditors. Mrs. Cockerham is charged for wasting community property by supporting
her lover. In 1971, the husband got
custody of the kids! His big mistake
financially was “popping off”. He should
have given the “NOW” speech: “I’m not half of anything. She’s not my agent, and she’s not my
partner.” Then he should have turned

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Tax consequences of different forms of
corporations</b></a><b></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>From 1913-1960, the almost invariable rule where you had a
corporation was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>double taxation</i>,
meaning: (1) the corporation itself is subject to tax, and (2) when the income
is paid over (the dividend), they are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>again
</i>subject to tax, and (3) when the corporation dissolves and distributes its
assets to shareholders, there is a tax at the corporate level on the difference
between the fair market value of assets and what the company paid for them <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> there is a further tax at the
shareholder level on the difference between what the shareholder paid for the
stock and the value that he received.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The first exception came in 1942 for mutual funds. In the late 1950’s and early 1960’s, a
similar deal was put in for Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs. It’s an odd statute. It says that if you’re a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>trust</i> taxable as a corporation and you make the election, it is
similar to mutual funds. If you pay out
a certain percent of your income each year (something like 95%), then as to
what is paid out, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i> aren’t taxed on
it; only the recipient shareholders are taxed on it. REITs haven’t had as great a run as mutual
funds. Shipman speculates that the
promoters have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>benefited themselves</i>
more than shareholders.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297500"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Subchapters C and S</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At the same time, a huge amendment to the Internal Revenue
Code, Subchapter C came into being. This
is the general subchapter governing corporations. All the rules in this section are double and
triple taxation! If you meet the
requirements and make the election properly, you are governed mainly by
Subchapter S. But where Subchapter S
doesn’t deal with an issue, you go back to Subchapter C. Sub S is a bit different than the mutual fund
situation. How many companies can
elect? It must be a <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> corporation. It can have no more than a certain number of
shareholders (75 as of the last edition of the book). No shareholder can be a partnership,
corporation, or ordinary trust. There
are limits on the extent to which non-resident aliens can own stock in the Sub
S company.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Making and keeping this election is complicated! It requires a lawyer because what you have to
have is a shareholders’ agreement under O.R.C. § 1701.591 to restrict the
transfers of shares and require election of consent by everybody who gets the
shares. The board of directors files the
consent with the Internal Revenue Service, but they have to have consents from
all shareholders. It’s a two-level
proposition. If you’re only dealing with
one or two shareholders, it’s pretty simple, but if you’re dealing with 45,
it’s going to get complicated.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If the election is made, the situation is about 70% like
that of a general partnership. Tax
lawyers describe this as “flow-through taxation”. That means that the corporation files a
return, but it’s an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>information return </i>as
to income taxes. As to taxes other than
income taxes, it’s fully subject, just like GM: excise taxes, sales taxes, real
estate taxes, corporate franchise taxes and so on. But they file a return, and then at the end
of the year they inform each shareholder of his or her share of the net income
or net loss for the year and the shareholders include it in their income just
like in a partnership (in a way). If the
company <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>keeps</i> all the income, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>it’s still taxable to the shareholders
currently</i>. That’s one of the reasons
why you must have a § 1701.591 agreement. You want to require, say, half of earnings to be paid out because the
shareholders have to pay state, city, and federal income taxes.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Suppose the company makes $1 million in year one, has one
shareholder, and pays nothing out. The
company pays no tax, but the shareholder is subject to tax on $1 million,
absent a R.C. 1701.591 agreement. If the
shareholder is Bill Gates, it’s no biggie since Gates is worth $50
billion. But for most people, it’s a big
deal! Suppose that in year two, that
money is paid out. That’s called <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>previously taxed income</i>. If the company broke even in year two but
gave a $1 million check to the guy, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>he
wouldn’t pay any tax on that</i>, because it would be previously taxed
income. Most states now allow this, but <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
did not until about 20 years ago.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc76297501"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>LLCs and Subchapter K</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let us compare Sub S to the new kid on the block from Sub
K-land: the LLC! First of all, you can
have an LLC if you “check the box”. You
can have an LLC with Sub K treatment even if a corporation, a trust, a partnership
or a non-resident alien is a member of the LLC! Furthermore, the numbers can exceed the 75 specified shareholders in Sub
S. There is an upper limit, and it comes
in a “back-handed” way. Under <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>current tax law</i>, no new Sub K entity can
have securities traded on a public market. We will discover that two sections of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, §§ 15(d) and 12(g)(1), will cause (1) an entity that makes a registered
public offering under the Act of 1933(?) or (2) any entity with 500 or more
holders to file public periodic reports with the SEC. With those reports, under Rule 15c2-11 of the
1934 Act, a public market <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> be made
by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> broker-dealer in the country
on that stock. In addition, under §§
12(a) and (b) of the 1934 Act, if you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>voluntarily</i>
list any security on a national securities exchange there is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se</i> a public market in that
security. Therefore, as a practical
matter, you have to work with a securities lawyer and avoid these four sections
of the Act. It’s a back-handed
limitation. Grandfathered in are a few
old limited partnerships from the 1980s that are listed on a couple of
exchanges: these are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>master limited
partnerships</i>. They were cut off a
few years ago, but there are a few hanging around.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>LLCs have another use: they are widely used for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mineral interests </i>held by entrepreneurs,
for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>real estate</i> held by a real estate
investor, and for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intellectual property</i>. They are widely used for two reasons: (1)
Wealthy people will often leave property in trust to a bank to manage for their
family. The big banks and trust
companies want investment property given to them to manage in trust to be in
corporate form or LLC form in order to minimize their potential liability. If the LLC goes bankrupt, they’re unlikely to
get stuck. (2) Very often you’ll have
two or more entrepreneurs come together, each contributing some assets. After a few years, each one often wants to
pull their own contribution out and go their own way. If you have a corporation, even a Sub S
corporation, there will be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tax </i>on
“phantom income” at the corporation level, measured by the difference between
the cost of the assets and the current fair market value. If you’re in a Sub K situation, however, very
often the split will be tax free to the LLC <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
tax free to the member taking back what he contributed. He’ll simply take over the LLC’s basis and
move forward.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>caution</i>: don’t
ever put publicly traded securities in a Sub K entity. There’s a tax trap there! There are three better ways to do this: (1)
With publicly traded securities, put it in a revocable trust. If you do it right, contributions to the
trust and the unraveling of it will be tax free. (2) Another option is a managing agency
account with a big bank. As the name implies,
there’s no trust, there’s no entity, although the stock will be in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>name</i> of the bank, it is a simple
managing agency account and there is no consequence in setting it up, and you
have the right to revoke it at any time and they will register the stock in
your name and return it to you. (3)
Finally, the third way to go is a street name account at a big brokerage
house. They call it this because they’ll
hold the stock in the name of their own “nominees” (some of their senior
executives). That makes trading a lot
easier. If you need it back at any time,
they’ll deliver the securities to you.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hishon v. King &amp;
Spalding</i> – A single female associate was passed over for partnership, so
she sued, alleging that it was because of her gender. If that proved true, usually that creates a
right of action under Title VII. The
argument was made by the defendants that: (1) partners are not employees (which
is generally true). There’s no
withholding of their earnings. They
usually are not covered by workers' compensation. (2) A partnership is an “intimate choice” of
business associates and thus it would be improper to apply this civil rights
law.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Court ruled that the first proposition is correct, but
the second proposition is not. If you
hire associates, holding out some possibility of partnership, it is
discrimination against employees (associates of a general partnership law firm
are employees) to discriminate. A
12(b)(6) motion was reversed. Even if
the plaintiff thought she could win, would she really want to keep working
there? The case was settled for a pretty
big money award. Note that the equal
employment statutes (and other civil rights statutes) provide that if you
prevail in your suit, you can get reasonable attorney’s fees.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Up to quite recently, professionals in all states were
prohibited from incorporating. The state
legislatures and courts thought that they should stick with the general
partnership or else their personal liability would extend to their personal assets
as well as the firm’s assets. Around
1960, law firms saw that their colleagues in the general counsel’s offices of
corporations were getting good tax breaks on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>fringe benefits</i>: for example, pension plans and health
insurance. The law firms wanted <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>relief</i> and went in two directions: (1)
they went to Congress, and Congress passed the Jenkins-Keogh Act, also known as
Pension Plans for the Self-Employed. Jenkins-Keogh is not as liberal as pension plans for corporation employees. So this is only partial relief. (2) They went to state legislatures, and most
state legislatures, if not all, authorized <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>professional
corporations</i>, a special professional corporation statute. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
it was passed in about 1960 and it is in Title XVII. It’s an odd statute that you apply in
conjunction with § 1701.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, many
doctors and dentists immediately hopped on the professional corporation
bandwagon. Many are still there
today. CPAs could not because the code
of ethics of the AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants)
prohibited incorporation. This business
form was available to lawyers too. But
there was a big “hiccup” along the way! The Ohio Supreme Court ruled that (1) the legislature could not
legislate concerning the governance of lawyers in this way, (2) only a Supreme
Court rule could allow it, and (3) they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>would</i>
allow it, but only if there was a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charter
provision</i>, saying that each shareholder of a professional corporation of a
legal nature had the same liability as a general partner of a general
partnership.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This statute, even as to doctors, has a clause in it that
the shareholders have the same liability as general partners of a general
partnership. So what has happened in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
in the interim? In around 1995, the Ohio
Supreme Court issued new rules, saying that lawyers can go into an LLC, a §
1701 corporation, the old professional corporation, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and</i> that the old provision about shareholders having the same
liability as general partners of a partnership was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>abolished</i>. Different states
are at different stages on this right now, and it works differently for each
profession. You must look at each
profession. The <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>

liberalism ideals, moreso than state court judges.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What’s the problem with the 15? There were four shareholder officers and
directors. For state workers'
compensation purposes, they were treated as employees, and that would also be
the case in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. For unemployment compensation purposes, both
federal and state, they were treated as common law employees. If you excluded these four or five people,
there weren’t 15 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>employees</i>, and the
company moved at summary judgment for exclusion from the statute. That issue, in the Second Circuit, had been
resolved against the shareholder/employees. They held that if you choose the corporate form, the fact that you’re a
shareholder, and even a majority shareholder and a director doesn’t affect the
fact that if you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>work</i> full-time for
the company, then you are an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>employee</i>. Out west, one of the courts held just the
opposite: it’s a small, intimate, professional corporation. The shareholders who are also officers and
who work full-time for the company are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>
employees. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
this case would go against the doctors.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Stevens, for the majority, says that he will remand the case
so that the Court of Appeals can apply his opinion. He says that he might agree with the
corporation <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as to </i>shareholders who
work for the company and who have such <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>large</i>
stock holdings that they cannot be fired. It’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cannot be fired test</i>! If a single doctor incorporated, and he was
the sole director, the president, and the sole medical employee, then no one
could fire him. The Second Circuit, or <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
in that situation would say that this guy is still an employee. Now change the facts: three doctors own a
third and each one is on the board of directors. Note: any two of them could fire the third. So, applying the Stevens test, they can all
be fired!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Stevens goes over the status of the Restatement Second of
Agency under federal law. When agency
issues com up in the context of federal statutes, the Court has made it clear
that they will go to Restatement Second of Agency and apply it. Why? You get national uniformity. Stevens discusses the 12-14 items you look at to determine if a person
is a servant-agent, and he says that will apply. The truly important thing is usually the
person’s time allocation, place allocation, and minute-by-minute conduct subject
to legal power by a third person, then there is a servant-agent relationship.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the Graham memo, we saw in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Cargill</i> case an expansion of this doctrine for liability
purposes. If X has the same <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>de facto</i> power over Y, then Y is a
servant-agent even if X isn’t the direct supervisor of Y. Agency is a conduit for liability. In a recent Ohio Supreme Court case on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>control</i> (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>de facto </i>or legal), we had a client power company that wanted a
building built. There was a general
contractor and a subcontractor. Usually,
if someone like the electric company hires a general contractor and doesn’t go
too far in the general supervision of that contractor, then if there is
negligence by the general contractor or by a subcontractor, then the client
electric company won’t be liable. The
one exception will be negligence in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>selecting</i>
the contractor: you commit negligent selection when you pick a contractor
that’s always getting people killed. All
construction contracts call for progress payments: pay as you go. At the end, you’ll have about 15% outstanding,
which will be paid three or four months later after a very detailed <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>final</i> inspection of the building as
competed.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here, the building company directed how the electric wiring
on the construction site was to be handled. They weren’t an electric company, but they thought they knew
everything! “Electrocuted doesn’t
necessarily mean killed.” So a guy was
electrocuted and seriously injured. He
had a workers' compensation claim through his boss, the subcontractor. But money was scarce in that household. So the guy sued the client electric
company. The Ohio Supreme Court said: if
you’re the client on a construction project and you take <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>excessive control</i>, you have turned the people under you into your <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>servant-agents</i>. Both in contract and in tort, you’ll be
liable. Too much is too much, and too
little will get you in trouble too.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pinter Construction
Company v. Frisby </i>– This case concerns the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>statutory employer</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>doctrine</i>
for workers' compensation purposes. It
involved a construction contract, which in turn involved a subcontract. The subcontract did not mention workers'
compensation. The subcontractor had no
workers' compensation because they didn’t pay the premium! A worker was injured on the subcontractor’s
job. The subcontractor has no workers'
compensation, which is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>illegal</i>, but <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>it happens a lot</i>. The Utah Supreme Court held that the general
contractor, at minimum, should have required, in the contract, that the
subcontractor to get workers' compensation and pay the premiums. When the general didn’t do so, the general
became the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>de facto</i> employer of the
guy who was injured, and thus the guy would get workers' compensation through
the general contractor.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>Both workers' compensation and respondeat
superior involve <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>scope of employment</i>
determinations. Over the last hundred
years, scope of employment has expanded to protect workers: there can be scope
of employment even if there is a violation of the work rules of the employer.<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two statutory exceptions to workers' compensation:
(1) If you’re under chemical influence on the job, you can’t recover. (2) If you intentionally injure yourself, you
can’t recover. One of the questions
we’ll cover later is the issue of a truck driver who decides to commit suicide
by driving his truck into a bigger truck on the highway. This is an analogy to “suicide by cop”. Clearly, there is no workers' compensation
because he left a suicide note that was given to the cops. But what about respondeat superior? Does it go that far? Shipman doubts it very much. In the review session, we’ll say that no one
can go to the widow and say that it’s alright and that he’ll be covered because
it would ratify coverage <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>after the fact</i>. You must keep everyone’s mouth shut in order
to avoid respondeat superior!</p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297504"><b

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>What’s the game that the insurance companies play? Just after the insured the formal, written,
signed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>claim </i>with the company (which
is a prerequisite, along with immediate notification of the insurance company
when something happens). Right after the
claim is filed, the insurance companies have on their computer <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reservation of rights letters</i>. The insured has informed the insurer and has
filed your claim. Then you get a reservation
of rights letter. They tell you that
they have your claim and they say that they will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>defend you</i>. The main reason
people get liability insurance is to defend against B.S. lawsuits. The other thing that you want from insurance
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>coverage</i>. Some cases really do have merit!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At this point, you should go hire a good plaintiff’s lawyer
who will send to the insurance company the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zoppo</i>
letter. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Zoppo</i> is an Ohio Supreme Court case from the 1990’s on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bad faith by the insurance company</i>. If there’s bad faith by the insurance
company, they are liable, and if it’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>serious
enough</i>, as in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zoppo</i>, punitive
damages will flow. Remember, in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
this is one of three or four states where you get attorney’s fees along with
your punitive damages. When a doctor is sued,
if he’s satisfied with the lawyer that the insurance company provides for him,
Shipman says he should still hire a good lawyer to look over the shoulder of
the insurance company’s lawyer, “just to let them know that they’re not dealing
with a rube.” <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Zoppo</i> letter will remind the insurance company of its fiduciary
duties. An insurance contract is one of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>utmost good faith</i> (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>uberrima fides</i>).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Usually, nothing will come of the reservation of rights
letter. So why do they send it? By statute and common law, if they don’t send
the letter and then defend you, they are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>estopped</i>
from affirming the exclusions or lack of coverage later. About one time in ten after the reservation
of rights letter, the insurance company will file a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>declaratory judgment action</i> separate from the one in which you’re
being sued. In most cases, the judge in
the first suit will get this judgment over to a colleague on the <st1:Street><st1:address>Common
  Pleas Court</st1:address></st1:Street>. Why is this done? In the old
days, if the insurance investigator could wriggle out of the insured any
admission that led to an exclusion, then it’s tough crap for the insured! A Texas Supreme Court case from around 1960,
and an <st1:State><st1:place>Arizona</st1:place></st1:State> case from the
1970’s changed the world. They said that
the lawyer employed by the insurance company to represent the insured owned <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>high fiduciary duties </i>to the
insured. And if it’s through
confidential attorney-client conversation that the attorney learns of the
exclusion, the attorney must resign, or keep going but not say anything to the
insurance company. In a really testy
case, the insurance company will hire two lawyers: one to represent the
insured, and one to represent the interests of the insurance company.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So we had a declaratory judgment action in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perl</i>. In the 1950’s, it was hornbook law that if there was no coverage, then
there was automatically no duty to defend. Since then, it has evolved more toward the rule in the first <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perl</i> case, referred to in the second
one, which is that the mere <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>presence</i>
of allegations that would take things out of the policy will not cause the duty
to defend to go away, even if, at the end of the day, there is no coverage.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, we
have a broad declaratory judgment statute. These actions are broad. The
insured will go to a lawyer, who will handle it. Under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
case law, if the insured wins the declaratory judgment action, the court <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may </i>(emphasis on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>may</i>) award <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable
attorney’s fees</i> for the declaratory judgment action. It’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>broader</i>
than insurance, but it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>applies</i> to
insurance.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perl v. </i><st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>St. Paul</i></st1:place></st1:City><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Fire &amp; Marine</i> – Any attorney has
the duty of care, the duty of loyalty, and the duty to communicate up-front all
material facts. Here, the second and
third were violated because the insurance adjuster used to work for the Perl
firm, and the attorney didn’t run that fact by his client. He should have explained it and gotten her
consent. Clear up the conflicts of
interest up front, because they can kill you! It’s a contingent fee contract with a high contingent fee for
settlement, 40%. The client wasn’t
complaining about that. The client
wasn’t complaining about the negotiations with the insurance company. She got $50,000 and $30,000 after the
contingent fee was paid. But of course,
to use modern terminology, “she felt used and abused”, and that generates
lawsuits.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So the client sues. What are the causes of action? (1) negligence, (2) fiduciary duty, (3) fraud, and (4) a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se</i> rule in Minnesota and three or
four other states: any agent who misbehaves <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>significantly</i>
toward the principal during the employment must <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>refund </i>the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>whole amount paid</i>,
even if the work was good and there were no actual damages. The latter is called a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>prophylactic </i>rule. It’s
designed to prevent harm and strike fear into agents so that they’ll do right
by their principals.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Minnesota and the lower court agreed
that there was no cause of action alleged in common law negligence or common
law fraud because for any tort, you must plead and prove an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual legal injury</i>, that is, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>damages</i>. Consider the general fiduciary duty claim: you must plead and prove some
actual legal injury. If you’re seeking
an injunction up-front, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>probable</i>
damages are enough. Next, we came to the
fraud exclusion. The court held that
there are two types of fraud: (1) actual legal fraud with scienter, and (2) <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>constructive </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>equitable</i> fraud between the fiduciary and the beneficiary of the
relationship. Thus, they held that the
second type of fraud, which is basically <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unfairness</i>,
does not trigger the fraud exclusion. So
the fraud doesn’t apply. Does the
coverage clause cover the refund of fees? They said yes. They follow the
maxim that insurance policies are construed, when reasonable to do so, to
benefit the insured. The coverages are
interpreted <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>broadly</i>, and the
executions are construed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>narrowly</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about the public policy arguments? As to the firm itself, its ability to refund
is based entirely on respondeat superior. The firm did not tell Perl to do what he did, and they didn’t ratify
what he did. But, coverage of Perl, the
actor, is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>against public policy</i>. When an insurance company covers both
principal and agent, principal cannot recover from the agent when the principal
has to pay off to a third party. But,
the court says, the result here is $20,000 to the plaintiff, to be paid by the
insurance company on behalf of the firm. How do we equalize with Perl? The
answer is that when the insurance company pays off on behalf of the law firm to
the plaintiff, they’re subrogated to her rights. Also, they are subrogated to the rights of
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>firm</i> against Mr. Perl. Therefore, the insurance company will cut a
check to the plaintiff and then, on remand, the trial court is going to enter a
judgment against Mr. Perl <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>personally </i>for
$20,000.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Was all this litigation worth it to the plaintiff? Not objectively. Two trips to the Minnesota Supreme Court
could take years and tens of thousands of dollars. Money is always among the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>top three </i>reasons that people sue, but
it is seldom #1, according to Shipman. The client was pissed off! She
wanted the court to find that Perl was a bad S.O.B. The moral of the story is to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>keep your clients happy</i>. Watch how a doctor practices: they are very
cagey about that. They are always asking
how you feel about things, asking you to telephone between visits, and telling
you that you can call at home.</p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297505"><b

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>State corporation statutes are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>enabling</i> statutes, designed to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>encourage
investment</i>. The third part of the
triangle is entrepreneurs and managers. Other heavily regulatory state statutes like antitrust, securities,
environmental, and equal employment remain applicable. The state decided early on that corporations
should be subject to the heavy regulatory statutes. But you won’t find those in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>state</i> statutes. Nearly all corporate statutes in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> are at the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>state level</i>, with a few exceptions. Through antitrust, tax statutes, employment statutes, environmental
statutes and many others, Congress heavily regulates.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>To form a corporation, you must fill out what are called
“Articles of Incorporation”, signed by one or more <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>incorporator</i>. You take that
to the Secretary of State’s office, pay a filing fee, and the process is
started. In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
that same document is known as a “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Certificate</i>
of Incorporation”. The generic name for
both is “charter”. In about half the
states, including some big ones like <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>, some version of the
Revised Model Business Corporation Act is in effect. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
or <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>, the Revised MBCA
doesn’t govern. So we’ll study these
three sets of statutes. The first MBCA
was put out in 1946. The revised version
came out in the 1990’s. The general
Shipman rule is that unless there is a very good reason otherwise, incorporate
locally. The corporate charter is a
public document. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
only, the rules of a corporation are called the “regulations”. Everywhere else, including <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
the rules are called the corporate “bylaws”. These are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> a matter of
public record, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless</i> you’re a public
company, in which case the bylaws will be on file with the SEC in <st1:State><st1:place>Washington</st1:place></st1:State>. Bylaws can be subpoenaed in litigation,
though.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The general American rule is that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>internal affairs </i>of a corporation are governed by the law of the
state of incorporation. “Internal
affairs” denotes the relationship between shareholders, creditors, the
corporation itself, the officers, directors, and the promoters. If you’re incorporated in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
but you set up a store in <st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>
and hire workers in <st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>, the
<st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State> workers' compensation
statute will apply. Furthermore, if you
make money in <st1:place><st1:City>Kentucky</st1:City>, <st1:State>Kentucky</st1:State></st1:place>
will tax you on what you make. If one of
your <st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State> drivers “runs over
a baby in <st1:City><st1:place>Lexington</st1:place></st1:City>”, then <st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>
law will govern too. But if there’s a
dispute between shareholders and the corporation over the election of
directors, then <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> law will
nearly always govern. You can find this
in Restatement Second of Conflicts of Laws, which actually indicates that there
are a few exceptions to this. In
practice, we can say that the courts are not quite as consistent as the
Restatement indicates.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zahn v. Transamerica</i>
– Here are the three big holdings of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Transamerica</i>: (1) Controlling shareholders have very high
fiduciary duty to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> the
corporation and to minority shareholders. Anybody who litigates knows that if you’re representing a plaintiff and
you can prove a high fiduciary duty on the part of the defendants, you’re a
long way toward home. (2) This holding
is more by the district court than the Court of Appeals. The district judge reminded the Court of
Appeals (“ever so delicately”) that even if there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>total </i>conflict of interest in the corporate arena, and even if it
is severe, if the fiduciary can show <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overall
reasonableness </i>as to disclosure up front and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>overall reasonableness</i> on the merits, and no harm to creditors,
then the transaction will stand. In this
particular case, there was no injury to creditors because all the creditors
were paid off. There was a failure in
disclosure here that led to the 1:1 instead of 2:1 splitting of tobacco
inventory. (3) Disclosure was also
violated in this case under SEC § 10(b) and rule 10b-5.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The court read the charter: the label preferred stock (Class
A) could be called by the corporation at a certain rate. The Class B shares were a lot more
complicated. Is the declaration and
payment of dividends <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mandatory</i>? In this case, the answer was no. How do we know this? The dividends were “when, as, and if
declared”, and this was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-mandatory</i>
language. Can you have mandatory
preferred stock as to dividends, though? Generally, you can’t because the board of the directors and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only</i> the board determines whether
dividends are paid (with certain exceptions to be developed later). One exception is that when you have a
closely-held corporation where all the shareholders have signed a § 1701.591
agreement and the creditors aren’t hurt by the agreement, then that agreement
can provide for mandatory dividends.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Is the dividend cumulative? That is, if, in a given year, the directors don’t declare dividends on
preferred stock, do the directors <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ultimately</i>
have to pay it? The footnotes of this
case say that the drafter made sure it was cumulative by saying: “if they don’t
declare in a year, they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shall accumulate</i>”
and “if any dividends <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>have</i> been
passed, the common stockholders can’t get a penny until any accumulated
dividends are paid”. Is a preferred
stock <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>participating</i>? Today, you seldom see participating preferred
stock. But this Class B stock <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is </i>participating. Once the board pays the annual dividend on
the Class B, the rest of what’s left is split between the Class B and the
common stock. Class B gets two bites at
the apple! How do you make a preferred <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-participating</i>? You use the phrase “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and no more</i>” after the words “dividend of $X, when, as, and if
declared by the board of directors”.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Is the stock callable? To make a stock callable, it requires special language. The language is here: the stock can be called
at par plus accrued unpaid dividends. A
call provision is always for the benefit of the most <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>junior</i> security, that is, common stock, because it puts a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cap</i> on what the more <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>senior</i> security can take. Is the stock convertible? This takes special language too. Class B in this case could go into the common
stock, but only 1:1, and they give up their accrued, undeclared dividends. Does the preferred stock have a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>put</i>? A put is an option whereby the holder of the option can <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>force someone else</i> to buy at a
stipulated price or under a stipulated formula (like fair market value, for
example).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Court of Appeals held that because all of the directors
of Axton-Fisher were officers or directors of Transamerica, there was an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overarching</i> conflict of interest, and
the board of Axton-Fisher could not call the preferred stock. The district judge says to the Court of
Appeals that they got it all wrong. The
district judge says that the overriding rule of law is that even if there is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>complete </i>conflict of interest, if the
fiduciary shows overall fairness as to disclosure up front and on the merits,
and creditors are not injured, then there is always a complete defense in the
corporate world against conflict of interest transactions (but in the trust
world, this isn’t necessarily true).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Then the district judge says that the call provision is for
the benefit of the common stock, and the conversion provision is for the
benefit of the holders. T<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hen</i>, this judge looks at Rule 10b-5 and
says that to compute damages, let’s assume the board of Axton-Fisher did it
right, in which case they would have called the Class B. However, if under Rule 10b-5 they should have
informed the Class B holders of what was going on. The Class B, having been informed of that,
all would have converted. Therefore, the
judge says to the B holders that they should get 1:1, not 2:1. Shipman says that this is right! The terms of securities, including debt
securities, are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>everything</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you have about the same disclosure duty under state law
that you would have under 10b-5, and the disclosure duty under state law is on
a fiduciary basis, then you plead the matter today under state law rather than
under Rule 10b-5. How come? (1) 10b-5 always requires scienter. Under state law, if there is a heavy
fiduciary duty, mere negligence, without any scienter at all, may well
suffice. It’s easier to prove negligence
than fraud in either federal or state court. (2) In the 1990’s, there were three federal statutes that cut way back
on 10b-5 class actions. More on these
statutes later in the course. These statutes
are “plaintiff killing fields”. If you
can avoid them, do so. They apply to
class actions for fraud. Therefore, if
you go under state law theories that don’t require fraud to be proved, then you
avoid them. (3) In the last 25 years,
about half of the federal judges have become more anti-plaintiff in the
corporate area to some degree. At the
state level, it’s a more even playing field. Even with class action suits, often you stick with the simpler state law
theories rather than going to <st1:State><st1:place>Washington</st1:place></st1:State>
or to the federal courthouse. This is
very pragmatic but true. This case is
very important! Master this case!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Frick v. Howard</i> –
This case deals with the fiduciary duty aspect of the promoter’s liability
doctrine. Since the promoter took a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-negotiable</i> note and assigned it to
the plaintiff, the plaintiff took over all of the disabilities of the assignor
and because he couldn’t meet any one of the three <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>validating tests</i>, he stood in the shoes of the promoter and his
claim for secured status was denied.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In this case, the promoter is a lawyer who thinks that the
town needs a motel. He buys land for
about $200,000. He probably disclosed
that he would transfer the land to a corporation that would run the hotel. Today, he would have to negotiate with the S
&amp; L because usually it would put a “due upon sale” clause in the first
mortgage note, and unless they consent to the transaction, they could
accelerate the note and cause it to come due. This is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> a consumer
transaction. There are no federal consumer
statutes involved. Everyone is a
business, not a consumer. The lawyer ups
the value, in his own mind, to $310,000. The lawyer takes back roughly a $110,000 second mortgage <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>note</i>, plus a second mortgage. In a mortgage, there are always <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>two instruments</i>. There is a note, which is the in personam
promise to pay of the maker, and there is the second mortage, which is a real
property interest that you record at the courthouse giving you the right to
foreclose if the principal and interest payments aren’t made. The two instruments are “tied together like
Mary and her little lamb”.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A note is a two-party debt instrument. There is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>maker </i>of the note, who signs at the bottom, and the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>payee</i>. A note is to be distinguished from a bill of exchange which is a
three-party debt instrument. With that
instrument, there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>maker</i>, a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>drawee</i>, and a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>payee</i>. The drawee is the
bank, the payee is the person who you write in, and the maker is the
signer. A note is two-party. There are all kinds of bills of exchange, but
we won’t get into them and we’ll stick with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>notes</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This is a rank real estate promotion, meaning that it is a
very heavily leveraged real estate corporation. This is the opposite end of the world from the highly secure Exxon! A big danger for highly leveraged companies
is that they will go insolvent. How do
the courts deal with insolvent corporations? They do it in two ways: (1) The
insolvent person can file a voluntary state court receivership or it can be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>involuntary</i> by creditors forcing the
insolvent into the state court receivership. (2) The insolvent person, at the front end, has the option of going
under the Federal Bankruptcy Code of 1978, found at 11 U.S.C., and they can file
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>voluntary</i> petition of
bankruptcy. Also, initially the
creditors could have filed an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>involuntary</i>
petition in bankruptcy, and a third possibility is that once a state court
receivership is filed, the creditors can force it to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
a unit <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>of</i> the U.S. District Court
with its own clerk and its own judges. It is reviewed by the U.S. District Court, and a district court judge
can take charge of a proceeding at the beginning if they’d like.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The creditor sign and file, on time, formal claims asking
for a “piece of the pie”. It’s the same
way in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
district court.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The $110,000 note, which was originally payable to the
promoter (the lawyer), who was the 100% shareholder, had been <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>assigned</i> by him to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had filed a secured claim in
the state court receivership. He says:
“I have a good $110,000 face amount claim, plus interest, as a secured creditor
in this proceeding!” The court, acting <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sua sponte</i>, started this proceeding to
determine whether this guy had a valid claim.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So what does the court hold? First, a note, if it is worded as “pay to X or pay to the order of X”
will usually be a negotiable instrument under Uniform Commercial Code Article
III. But this note lacked this
language. It simply said: “pay to
X”. The lawyer assigned it to his buddy
for lots of cash. The court holds
that: (1) The note is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>a negotiable instrument under
Article III of the Uniform Commercial Code. If it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were</i>, the holder of that
note could be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>holder in due course</i> and
have greater rights than his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>transferor</i>
had. It’s kind of like the Recording
Acts in Property. But since the words of
negotiability were missing, it was a simple, straightforward assignment and the
lawyer’s buddy stepped into the shoes of the lawyer. That is, every infirmity that the lawyer
suffered under, the buddy will also suffer under. (2) Just what kind of infirmities was the
lawyer under? The lawyer was a promoter,
and he owed very high fiduciary duties to the corporation and to the other shareholder.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When he sells property to the corporation, in order for that
to stand up, he must do one of two things: (1) he must prove <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overall fairness</i> of disclosure and the
substantive price and that creditors aren’t injured. Did the assignee of the promoter prove that
as to the promoter? No. (2) The promoter can only put people on the
board of directors who are independent, outside directors who are not beholden
to him. If they approve, it will be
tested under the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Business Judgment Rule</i>,
a rule of deference. That is, if they
approve it, it will stand <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless</i> the
other party shows fraud, arbitrary action, ultra vires (beyond the powers),
illegality, waste (meaning recklessness) and then the biggies: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gross</i> negligence in procedure, or gross
negligence on the merits. The last two
are usually the easiest to prove. Did
the lawyer’s assignee meet the Business Judgment Rule? No, because there wasn’t an independent Board
of Directors. (3) If all shareholders
and all present and future creditors consent after full and fair disclosure up
front, that would be another “out”. Did
the buddy qualify for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> of these
three “outs”? No! So the infirmities of the lawyer carry over
to him!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When you endorse an instrument to transfer, you have
secondary liability unless you write after that endorsement “without
recourse”. The lawyer didn’t want that
secondary liability! There are also
certain warranties under Article III whether it would be applicable or
not. The lawyer probably wrote “W/R and
without warranties”. What the lawyer did
here was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very dangerous</i>. The lawyer probably had a duty to tell the
purchaser that this was a non-negotiable note, subject to all the promoter’s
claims. Careful lawyers, when drafting a
non-negotiable note, will include the caption: “Non-negotiable note”. Why? There’s a case in the last thirty years that says that a lawyer who
wasn’t thinking about it but created a non-negotiable note was liable to a
remote purchaser who didn’t know it was a non-negotiable note. Are non-negotiable notes something you should
use at times? Sure they are! If you’re a manufacturer buying 300,000 parts
from someone, then if you give your non-negotiable note and the parts are defective,
then if they guy sues you on the note, you can set-off. It would be the same as if the guy sold the
note to a bank. But if you make the note
negotiable, then the note can be sold to a third party, like a bank. When the bank sues you on the note, you can’t
set-off the defective parts. Shipman
says that this is all a matter of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bargaining
power</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are also tax aspects to the formation of a corporation
or the issuance of new securities. Though this is not primarily a tax course, you must know how to spot tax
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>issues</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old Dominion</i>
cases<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>– What’s the situation? The promoters formed the corporation and each
of the promoters got stock in the corporation for $5. Soon after that, the corporation issues stock
to the public and charges the public $15 per share. It was not alleged that there was any fraud
in either sale of stock. Furthermore,
there is no injury to creditors alleged. Why? It’s because the company is
receiving money for stock and upon liquidation, stockholders take last after
creditors <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> no fraud is alleged.<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297507"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Four flavors of action</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here are four flavors of action. They’re related, but different. First, consider legal actions on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>behalf</i> of the corporation. The easiest one is the case of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Frick v. Howard</i>, where a company goes
insolvent and there is either a voluntary or involuntary state court
receivership <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>or</i> a trustee in
bankruptcy (“T/B”) who is appointed in a bankruptcy action in the United States
Bankruptcy Court under 11 U.S.C. State
court receiverships are quite complicated, and federal actions are even more
so! These are called <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>universal successors</i> to all of the
assets and causes of action of the corporation. The state court receiver or trustee in bankruptcy can do two things: (1)
they can assert any causes of action on behalf of the corporation that the corporation
has. The benefit of these causes of
action ultimately goes to the creditors. (2) The <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
bankruptcy judge or state court receiver has jurisdiction to pass on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>claims</i>. They must be filed correctly and in a timely manner. And the court for any good equitable or legal
reason can disallow claims or “push them down in the pecking order”. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Frick</i>,
the court says that if the claim was refilled as an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>unsecured</i> creditor’s claim, there might be a chance. But the unsecured creditors sit at the bottom
of the pecking order.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Next up, we have shareholder derivative actions, governed by
Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. A shareholder files a complaint, served it on
the corporation and the actual defendants, alleging that the defendants have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overreached</i> the corporation in some
way. The shareholder goes on to allege
that the corporation <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>should</i> sue, but
it hasn’t because the defendants <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dominate
the corporation</i> and they won’t sue themselves. Therefore, the shareholder wants to sue <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on behalf of the corporation</i>. If the court approves this (after a whole
bunch of motions before the answer), then the suit is tried. If the plaintiff gets a judgment, the
attorney for the plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees and there is notice and
opportunity for hearing on the attorney’s fees. Then the attorney for the plaintiff takes off the top. These actions are driven by plaintiffs’
lawyers! What’s left after that goes to
the corporation and the judgment is res judicata as to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all </i>shareholders (not just the suing plaintiffs), the corporation,
and all defendants. It’s a “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>true </i>true class action” because no
plaintiff can opt out. What the judge
says is res judicata as to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>everybody</i>. This is powerful stuff!!! If the defendants win, it’s also res judicata
as to everybody (they walk away scot-free). There are two other possibilities: (1) settlement, or (2)
dismissal. Under Rule 23.1, these are
possible only after the court orders a hearing and determines that it’s to
everyone’s benefit to approve the settlement or dismissal. Any settlement will contain extensive
provisions for the attorneys.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Matsushita</i>, you
had a friendly tender offer for a movie studio by a Japanese company. It was a good cash tender offer at a good
price. The family that owned the
controlling stake in the company didn’t like the fact that it was in cash
because they would have to pay taxes on it. They went to the offeror and asked to have them pay with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stock</i> instead of cash. They agreed. But the problem was that two SEC rules were violated (14d-10 and
10b-13)! After the deal closed, a class
action in the federal district court in <st1:City><st1:place>Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:City>
started up under federal law. But then
there was also a parallel action out of <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
state court under <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law! The <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
courts couldn’t hear the SEC issues! The
parties settled in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>. The defendants took the settlement from <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
to <st1:City><st1:place>Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:City> and claimed res
judicata. “Let my defendants go!” It went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which held
that as long as the hearing on settlement meets the Fourteenth and Fifth
Amendments, then a settlement in a state court can cover both the state action <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> related federal action. But it wasn’t all over yet. The case went back to <st1:City><st1:place>Los
  Angeles</st1:place></st1:City> and a panel of the Ninth Circuit found that
Justice Thomas, writing for a 9-0 Court, “didn’t really mean what he
said”. There was a rehearing en banc
before all the Circuit judges and the full court overturned the panel! The upshot of the case is that some
defendants love class actions because they love early settlements. Note, however, that those people who opted
out of the federal and state actions could proceed on their own.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There can be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>direct
action </i>by shareholders against the corporation or its fiduciaries. If there is an ultra vires action, the action
can be asserted derivatively or directly. The lawyer will always choose direct because Rule 23.1 is a “plaintiff’s
killing field”. Similarly, like an
action to force declaration of a dividend, can be asserted by either a class
action of shareholders against a corporation or a single shareholder. The plaintiff’s lawyer will make his decision
based on what’s likely to get better attorney’s fees. That’s just how it is!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the Massachusetts <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old
Dominion</i> case, which dealt with a few of the promoters, it was said that the
public selling price determined the value of the shares, and the promoters must
pay the company the difference between $5 and $15 times the number of shares
purchased. In the federal <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old Dominion</i> case, written by Holmes, it
was said that one of the exceptions to conflict of interest regulations applied
here because (1) there was no injury to creditors, (2) no fraud or information
deficiency was alleged, and (3) there was consent of all shareholders. That creates a defense to conflict of
interest? How did the <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old Dominion</i> case distinguish
Holmes’s opinion? They said that at the
time of the promotion a public offering was contemplated and that the low price
of the promoters was not put in the perspective, and so there was no unanimous
consent of all shareholders.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Rule 10b-5 says that when a promoter buys stock, for the
next five years, whenever the corporation issues stock to other people,
publicly or privately, you must disclose that (this is the “five year”
rule). Thus, today, the promoters in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old Dominion</i> would have put a paragraph
in the offering circular that disclosed the stock holdings of the
promoters. They would have disclosed
that the promoters paid $5 per share even though they were asking $15 per share
from the public. You must do this or
risk violating federal and state securities laws! If the promoters had followed the SEC
disclosure laws, then there will be unanimous shareholder approval, no harm to
creditors (because it’s beneath the creditors), no informational deficiency,
and no fraud. Put it all together, and
you get one of the exceptions to liability under conflict of interest
regulation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Well, if people are aware of SEC disclosure rules, and other
those rules these cases are irrelevant, why are these cases important? It’s all about compensating the promoter and
compensating <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sweat equity</i>. Today, the offering circular to the public
would fully disclose the $5 price. Generally, for tax purposes, if the promoters organize for $5 and then
you go to the public at $15, within two years of when you do it, the IRS will
say to the promoters: “You have $10 per share of ordinary income! Pay up!” If it’s over two years, the tax cases say that it is clear that the
promotion was “old and cold”.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297508"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Sweat equity and capital</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So what is the lesson of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old
Dominion</i>? We want to find the true
value of stock as applicable to the marriage, business-wise, of sweat-equity
and capitalists. Let’s start a new
business! We need $1 million. There’s a capitalist who has that much cash,
but he needs someone to run the company on a day-to-day business. Let’s say the capitalist will work 40 hours
per week. He’s a retired doctor who is
no longer practicing medicine. He needs
someone to put in the 80-hour weeks who has detailed operating knowledge of the
business (which the capitalist doesn’t have). Let’s use Subchapter S because the projections show that there are going
to be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big losses</i> for three years, and
then there will hopefully be a turnaround! The capitalist finds sweat equity and makes a handshake agreement that
the corporation’s two directors will enter into a three-year signed, written
contract for sweat equity with enough money for him to live on. There will be a similar contract for the
capitalist for less money (because he’ll be working less). Part of the sweat equity deal is that the guy
gets <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>half the upside</i>, that is, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>half</i> the common stock.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here’s how <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> to
do the deal right. The Internal Revenue
Code sections needed here are §§ 1032, 351, 61 (gross income includes income
from all sources and including non-cash assets as well as cash; shares of stock
of a corporation are clearly qualifying non-cash property), and 83 (if you
receive non-cash property and its transferability is restricted, you value it
at its value if it had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no </i>restriction
on it). In this transaction, the
transfer of shares must be restricted for two years under federal and state
securities laws. The restrictions will
be on the face of the certificates. It
will be fully valid if the restrictions are on the face in full caps: that’s
considered a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i> restraint on
alienation. Complying with the
securities laws is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What happens if a lawyer has sweat equity? There’s a $1 par stock. He buys 1000 shares at $1 each. There is a restriction on the face of the
certificate. The sweat equity dude buys
1000 shares at $1000 per share. The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old Dominion</i> rule says that you take the
highest price paid and project that value backwards to everyone. So our sweat equity has $999,000 income. Each share is worth $1000. He paid $1 for it. So we multiply $999 times the number of
shares, 1000. If the sweat equity person
is rich, then it’s no problem. They can
cut a check. But, for the average person
this is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>total disaster</i>. Even for Bill Gates, we wouldn’t be
thrilled. It will be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>service income</i> to sweat equity. Then you look at another Internal Revenue
Code section: § 162. It’s not quite as
bad for sweat equity as it looks. He gets
a deduction! Bill Gates can use a big
deduction! Since he’s working for the
company full-time, he has this great deduction. But the Internal Revenue Service will contend that the sweat equity is
promotional services for organizing the company, and thus is non-deductible
under §§ 263-66.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Sub S rules out any different classes of stock except one
category of common stock. But it has
some good rules! The debt/equity
distinction will give us headaches. But
what’s the beauty of Sub S? The
regulations have a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>straight debt
exception</i>. To be straight debt, it
must call for definite payment of principal and interest at definite
times. In that case, regardless of the
debt/equity ratio, for Sub S purposes, they will leave you alone. The regulations even say that you can use, in
certain cases, contractually subordinated debt. But you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can’t</i> use an income
bond. What’s that? It’s interest payable only if earned. That’s not allowed!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let’s say the capitalist buys 1000 shares of common stock at
$1 per share in cash. Then the
capitalist has half the upside. The
business requires $1 million to get off the ground. There’s a $999,000 straight debt note. But what’s wrong? The straight debt note will have to carry an
interest rate of 10-16% per year to be believable because it’s such a risky
note! However, that does not violate the
usury laws of any state, though there are some statutory limits in <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>. There is also a Federal Act that bans
“extortionary” interest rates. Plus,
this isn’t a consumer transaction.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Dunn &amp; Bradstreet reporting service is the service
for small business. To get listed there,
you must submit accounting statements, including a balance sheet which will
reveal just what is going on. The note
to an affiliate (that is, <a name="OLE_LINK1">someone who is controlling the
company or under common control of some other company</a>) will be listed. You want suppliers to sell to you on
credit. You want 30, 60 or 90 day
credit! It’s the same way with a lessor. But will this fly? At that extreme a level, it will not. You’ll have big problems. So how do you deal with it? When you go to get a bank loan, they will
require <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contractual subordination</i> of
the capitalist’s $999,000 to the bank. This will be explained more later. It really means <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>assignment</i>. Will that kill you under straight debt? Probably not, but the lessor will be
hesitant. Suppose the lessor says:
“subordinate that baby to all creditors!” The tax lawyer would say that at that point, you’ve violated straight
debt. If the company gets sued by
creditors, they’ll go after the capitalist! So they want everything to be joint and several. What about big suppliers? They’ll do the same thing. They’ll say that you must have a signed,
written joint and several guarantee individually from both the sweat equity guy
and the capitalist guy.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about cash flow problems? If the capitalist wants to avoid an
individual guarantee, he’ll have to switch his note to $990,000 of preferred
stock and give up the Sub S election. There
are “inbetween” ways to do this too. You
could split between the note and the stock. The sweat equity-capitalist problem is easier solved in an LLC than in
the corporate form.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about Internal Revenue Code § 1244? Shipman mentioned §§ 461-466, which were
added by Reagan in the 1980’s to discourage tax shelters. They say: “Even if you’re Sub S, which has a
flow-through, if you don’t work full-time for the company, you can’t use
flow-through losses as they arrive. You
can stack them up and use them when you sell the stock.” Full-time is 40 hours per week. If you’re a full-time lawyer or banker and
only work on your Sub S a few hours a week, you won’t get your flow-through
like in the old days.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here is an anomaly: what’s the tax effect of debt when it
goes bad? There is an odd set of rules
that we’ll look at tomorrow. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>One of the
ironies is that often, for a closely-held company, investing in common or
preferred stock is better than taking a note. Here’s a hypo: Daughter runs a non-Sub S company. It’s breaking even and it’s been around for
7-8 years. She needs to expand now. She turns to Father and wants him to buy
100,000 shares of stock. What
considerations go into it? First off,
look at it from a practical standpoint. Father is a retired physics professor with a good pension. He’s well-to-do but not wealthy. Suppose that Daughter is his only child and
he’s not married now. Say he can rake up
over $100,000. One of the problems will
be that Daughter and her co-investors will be more interested in their salaries
than dividends. That’s
understandable! Could Father make out
well? Sure! The company could do well. It could get bought out by a big public
company. Does Father want to be a
director or an officer? No way! He doesn’t want to be liable! What about the downside? On this hypo, if he invests and the company
goes under, he’ll get an ordinary business loss under § 1244, whereas if he <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lent</i> the money to the company and they
went under, then § 463-66 would only give him a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>capital</i> loss. § 1244 is a
sometimes useful <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>oddity</i>. It gives a limit for a single person. Lastly, you would tell him that his potential
for liability is quite low if he doesn’t try to run things, and isn’t an
employee, officer, or director. This is
called “disregard of the corporate fiction”. As long as he’s not active, he’s probably safe. But should he do it? He should consider his health. If he might get sick, he better hold onto his
money.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297509"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Executive stock options</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the 1970’s, executive stock option plans became very
popular. They are governed by §§ 83, 61,
and 162 of the Internal Revenue Code. §
83 tells you the results of a non-transferable stock option plan. When you advise a client about options, ask
for a plan! The plan can only be adopted
by the board of directors. No one else
is allowed to do it! And if you’re a public
company, you must follow SEC rules, including the proxy rules at § 14 and under
§ 16 (about which more later). § 162 of
the Internal Revenue Code contains a major subsection on executive stock
options for public companies. The first
thing to look for under the plan is the vesting period: the “use them or lose
them” provision. The point of options is
to tie employees to the company in some sense: a kind of consideration. There are exceptions, though: options can
vest even if someone is no longer an employee if the person dies or is
seriously injured and can no longer work.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a federal statute from three years
ago, says that public companies can’t lend money to insiders. If the employee is independently wealthy, he can
exercise his $1 million option. But for
the average person, this will be a problem. But the bigger problem comes from the tax standpoint. Other than § 83, the grant of a
non-transferable stock option to an executive usually creates no income at that
time. But if the employee wants to
exercise the option, he’s going to get taxable income, in this case to the tune
of $6,000,000! That is, 100,000 times
$70 minus $10. But the good news is that
subject to certain limits in § 162 (which gives a deduction for only <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i> salaries), the company gets a
deduction in the same amount and in the same time that the individual realizes
that income! This can make it so that a
company doesn’t have to pay any income taxes!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Since it’s a public company, the employee can use Rule 144
under the Securities Act to sell within the volume limits of that Rule. If it’s a big company, this Rule will pose
pretty much no problem. But if it’s a small
company with just a few hundred shareholders, it will be a big issue! The way out is to go to a big securities firm
and coordinate with the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inside</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>outside</i> legal counsel of the company and
with the CEO. Remember the Bernie Ebbers
story! He fired one of his top
executives for not telling him when he was going to exercise his options!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The brokerage house will lend the employee some money to
exercise the option, sell enough of the stock to pay back the loan plus taxes
(state, city, federal, Medicare, Medicaid and all that), and give him the
rest. He will have to get the company to
sign off on this because the option plan will have a provision about tax
withholding. The company must withhold
taxes on the gross income (federal, state, city, and the employee’s Medicare
tax). The company, the brokerage house,
and the employee will enter into a contract. The brokerage house will get its fee, then remit the withholding that
the company must then send to the tax authorities. The fee will be very high!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What if this is a private company and there’s no public
market for the stock? Once in a while,
the company will have enough money to buy the employee’s option out for what
it’s worth, after withholding taxes. The
employee pays taxes and the company gets the deductions. So options work well for public companies,
but for private companies that will stay private they are a bad idea. If the employee is rich enough to exercise
the option, they will, but that’s rare. But there’s yet another case! Private companies often want to go public. Say a private company goes public after six
years and they sell several billion dollars’ worth of stock in an IPO. After the IPO, the underwriter will restrict
the sale of the stock for nine months. The employee will have to clear the sale with the boss, too.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>With options and convertibles, you need to be concerned
about dilution of the common stock. If
there are $5 billion in outstanding convertible debentures and you can convert
10 shares for each 100 debentures, and your stock is selling for $60, the stock
will get really diluted when the debenture holders convert!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Lastly, in terms of accounting, companies may, if they wish,
may value the option upon its issue and treat it as an expense when issued for
accounting purposes. This is done by
lots of the country’s big companies! In
the future, all companies may be required to value their options when they are
granted and take an expense deduction on their income statement. The FASB (faz-bee, or the Financial
Accounting Standards Board) is a not-for-profit organization that sets GAAPs
(generally accepted accounting principles). FASB must be consistent with what the SEC says. But the SEC generally defers to the FASB when
setting GAAPs. Occasionally, the SEC
will step in, and “once in a blue moon” Congress will step in and alter the
rules.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Herbert G. Hatt </i>–
A woman who owned a company married a younger man and let him buy planes and
stuff. Then their marriage went
downhill. What starts off fairly
harmonious, given a death or resignation or two, becomes awful. This is a frequent exam question. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In this case, the parties signed a prenuptial
agreement. Let’s cover the law of
prenuptial agreements and in particular the law in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
after 1980.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>All states require a writing. <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and many other states require that the parties have separate and independent
lawyers. There must be mutual full
disclosure. The contract must be fair
when made. This was added by the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gross v. Gross</i> decision in the Ohio
Supreme Court. For subsistence alimony
(which is only awarded when a marriage goes on a long time), it must be fair <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>when performed</i>.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In this case and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wilderman</i>,
we see that if you’re a Sub C corporation, the Internal Revenue Service is
always bugging you on the issue of reasonableness of salaries. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wilderman</i>,
the Internal Revenue Service found that what the husband was getting was
unreasonable. Thus, they disallowed many
of the deductions. For a public company,
the same rule applies <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in theory</i>. In practice, however, it doesn’t so apply
because public companies hire <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>compensation
consultants</i> who have access to the earnings of corporate executives. Also, the federal income tax statutes
regulate, and if you meet those technical requirements, you’re
capitalized. Most public companies have
a majority of their directors as outside, independent directors. The Internal Revenue Service, as a practical
matter, usually doesn’t challenge the independence of directors of public
companies. For private companies, there
is constant friction of § 162(a), and that’s a big reason they go with Sub S or
a limited liability company. If you’re
an LLC or Sub S, the issue of excessive compensation doesn’t arise because
there is a flow-through.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wilderman v. Wilderman</i>
– This is a two shareholder corporation. The husband worked for the father when the father ran the company. When the husband married the wife, the father
turned in his stock certificate and two stock certificates were issued to the
husband and wife. There were two
directors: he and she. The marriage and
business went well for some time. The
husband was a good worker and a fine businessman. The salary scale was set at the company by
the fact that the husband was doing most of the work. He made himself the President and CEO, and
made his wife the “inside person”, doing the books and records. As long as the marriage goes well, it’s not a
big deal, but the marriage goes sour. It’s a deadlock! The board of
directors had two members, and they disagreed! Could there be an election of a new board of directors by the
shareholders? No, because the stock was
split 50-50! It’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>classic</i> deadlock situation!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What facts were on the husband’s side? There’s a corporate rule that officers are
elected for a term: one year and “for so much longer as is needed until a
replacement or successor is elected”. Therefore, they both remained directors and he remained the CEO. What’s the other big piece of paper in any
business transaction? It’s the bank
signature card! Shipman thinks that the
bank signature cards said that either person could write checks on behalf of
the corporation. Shipman thinks that the
wife wrote her own check to herself at the old, low scale, and then the husband
declared as CEO that he was worth a lot more than when the board of directors
had last passed on it!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He started
paying himself a lot more! Under <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law, the wife could go and get a custodian appointed and she could also bring a
shareholder derivative action.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, there
is no statutory provision for a custodian. We do have, however, case law that is favorable to the wife if this were
an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> corporation: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i>, which is “a case of
almost constitutional dimensions”. It
holds that if there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>true close
corporation</i> then (1) the fiduciary duties between the parties are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intense</i>, (2) the courts will give relief
promptly and (3) the suit can be brought either as a derivative action, or
bypassing Rule 23.1, which is good for plaintiffs.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So here are the holdings of the present case: (1) Only the
board of directors can set the salary for officers and top executive
employees. (2) If there is a deadlock,
the president (with check signing authority) can continue to pay himself under
the last pay scale approved by the board, including any bonuses.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dodge v. Ford Motor
Co.</i> – This case holds that (1) with regard to a close corporation, any
shareholder can sue the corporation and the directors directly to force a
declaration of dividends. This doesn’t
have to be a derivative action. The
court ruled that there existed a cause of action and if you can show gross
negligence then you can get the court to force the company to grant
dividends. But the court is reluctant to
draft these sorts of orders. (2) The
action of the directors in not declaring dividends is under the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deference rule of business judgment</i>. If the defendants can show business judgment,
the plaintiff must show one of these things: (1) arbitrariness, (2) ultra
vires, (3) illegality, (4) waste, (5) bad faith, (6) gross negligence in
procedure or (7) gross negligence on the merits. The last two are the biggies!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, there
is also <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>In re Estate of Byrum</i>, an
estate tax case. It came after
1970. It was written by Justice
Powell. This case involved both the
federal estate tax and <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> law
in regard to dividends. What’s the
federal estate tax? There are two
important federal taxes: the federal tax on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gifts</i>,
tied to a related tax on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>estates</i>. The estate tax can run up to 55%, and the
gift tax can run high too. There are
exceptions, though: transfers between spouses are exempted from both taxes. (About nine states have these taxes, too, and
many states have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inheritance</i> taxes,
which are similar to estate taxes. <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>,
on the other hand, has neither. They
want to encourage old, wealthy people to move there! But they tax all kinds of weird stuff other
than income and wealth!) This is a big
deal for tax planning for the wealthy. Note that the exemptions are up to about $1.3 million. Most people don’t have to worry. Recently, the exemption was only
$600,000. Technically, the estate tax is
begin phased out. The gift tax will
stay, “or else the income tax will be gutted”.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So what’s the situation in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Byrum</i>? This guy owned a lot
of the stock of a close corporation. He
gave away some to children, but kept 60% for himself so he could run the
company. According to the Internal
Revenue Code, if you transfer property with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>retained
major powers </i>over that property, then at your death, the property is in
your estate even though you transferred it to your kids. The government argued that since the old man
was going to set the dividend policy on the companies he maintained a major
power over the transferred minority shares. Justice Powell went through <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law and found statements that there was a heavy fiduciary duty of majority
shareholders in all matters, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>including
dividends</i>. Thus, because the
fiduciary duty was so strong, the old man had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i> retained a major power over the stock that was transferred to
the kids. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i> would agree with Justice Powell. This is very relevant stuff!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about a public company? Can you get a court order for a dividend there? In theory yes, but in practice, “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>forget it, baby!</i>” But the situation with a public company isn’t
as bad if there are no dividends. For
example, Microsoft pays no dividends, but their shares are highly liquid. But with a close corporation, your shares are
not very alienable and not very liquid!</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>– This deals with the deductibility of
interest. It’s governed by §§ 162 and
163 of the Internal Revenue Code. § 163
sets forth this test: (1) There are a lot of technical rules in § 163 that must
be mastered. First: you can’t make a
public issue of debt securities payable to the bearer. There must be a name on it! Outside the English-speaking world, that’s
done to screw the tax authorities! But
here, you can’t screw around with the tax authorities. If you issue debt to the public, you can’t
make it payable to the bearer. There
must be a name on there so the Internal Revenue Service can trace just who got
the interest. But this doesn’t apply to
private issuances of debt. (2) Most
public issuances of debt have to be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>registered</i>. It’s sort of like the previous rule: there
must be a bond registry maintained by the company. (3) The debt must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>classic debt in form</i>. There
must be definitely amounts of principal and interest required to be paid at
specified times, even if there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no
income! </i>The debt must <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>de facto equity</i>. With
closely held, Sub C corporations, as in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Slappey
Drive</i>, the shareholders who were also creditors did not force the company
to pay interest and principal on time. The court held that this is sloppy, and the company shouldn’t be allowed
the interest deduction.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In practice, if a public company meets the first two
qualifications, the court won’t go to the de facto equity test. How else can you deal with this? You can avoid it completely by electing Sub
S. A Sub S corporation is a
flow-through. As long as the debt is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>straight debt in form</i>, no sweat. The other way to avoid the problem is with an
LLC, governed by Sub K, and thus it’s flow-through and you don’t get into the
de facto equity or unreasonable salary problems (with an exception to be
mentioned tomorrow). But one of the big
selling points of a Sub S or LLC is that you avoid the unreasonable salaries
and de facto equity tests. If you’re Sub
C these days, you can still have problems with those areas! Watch out for the Internal Revenue Service
agents!</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pepper v. Litton</i> –
Here we have a closely held corporation. The owner had not taken his salary out. A creditor sues. Then all of the
sudden, the owner puts a lien on the assets of his company. The outside creditors went into state court
and challenged this on the ground of common law fraud with scienter. The <st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>
courts said that these were valid claims that he should have paid off as he
earned them, but they were valid nonetheless. The creditor filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. The major shareholder timely filed a secured
claim and showed the <st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>
court action to back it up.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Justice Douglas holds that bankruptcy courts are always <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>courts of equity</i>. Furthermore, a claim can be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equitably</i> subordinated if there are
strong equitable grounds for doing so. The
outside creditor in this case <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>did</i>
show such strong equitable grounds. Even
though there was purportedly a preclusion issue from the <st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>
court decision, <st1:place>Douglas</st1:place> held that the bankruptcy courts
recognize claim and issue preclusion, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>but</i>
because bankruptcy proceedings are unique and policy-oriented, then the
bankruptcy courts can deviate from normal preclusion jurisprudence if there’s a
really good reason. This was a case
where it was okay to deviate! Therefore,
they pushed the secured claim of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>insider
</i>below all creditors, including unsecured creditors who were <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>outsiders</i>. This is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equitable
subordination</i>: you push a claim down one or more levels on the pecking
order. Any court of equity has the power
to do this! A state court receiver has
the same power.</p>

<p>The result is a bit different than the result in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pepper</i>. Say you have a mid-sized public company that needs to raise more
money. They have already borrowed a lot
of money from a big insurance company and the loan agreement requires the
insurance company’s consent to any <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>new</i>
debt. The public company goes to the
insurance company, and the insurance company says that they may issue new debts
to outsiders, but only if it is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contractually
subordinated </i>to the insurance company.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The mid-sized public company will issue debentures
(unsecured debt) to the public, with the following clause: “This debt is
contractually subordinated to the debt of Insurance Company. In any insolvency
or bankruptcy proceeding, we authorize Insurance Company to file a claim on
their own behalf for their own debt and to file, as our agent, a claim for this
subordinated debt. If the total of those
claims yields Insurance Company less than the face amount of the debt to
Insurance Company plus interest, then Insurance Company keeps everything. If the total of the two claims filed by
Insurance Company yields more than the principal and interest of Insurance
Company’s debt, then the excess will be returned to us. These paragraphs create an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agency</i> and we hereby declare that the
agency is irrevocable as an agency coupled with an interest.”</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Contractual subordination is, in effect, an assignment
coupled with an agency coupled with an interest declared to be
irrevocable. Why that wording? The typical agency power is revocable even if
the revocation would cause the party revoking to be liable in damages (which is
counter-intuitive but correct). The big
exception is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>an agency coupled with an
interest</i>. You can’t make an agency
coupled with an interest merely by stating that it’s coupled with an
interest. The Restatement Second of
Agency says that the agent’s interest in performing services for a principal
doesn’t make it an agency coupled with an interest. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>But</i>,
if the agent advances substantial money or property, and the parties state
that, then the agency is irrevocable. In
our example above, the drafter “gilds the lily” to show intent.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Subordinated debt is widespread. If the subordination goes only to payment of
principal, it won’t screw up the tax deduction of a corporate payor. But if interest payments are also
subordinated, you’re dead. If the
subordination goes to all creditors and not just institutional lenders, then I think
you’re dead too.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you’re advising a controlling shareholder or a relative
of a controlling shareholder, you must tell them that in an insolvency
proceeding you’ll probably get equitably subordinated. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
O.R.C. §§ 1336.56-59 constitute the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraudulent
preference</i> statute. We also have a
form of the UFTA (Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act). Insiders and relatives and affiliates of
insiders will usually get <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pushed down</i>. Sarbanes-Oxley says that as to a public
company, if there is “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>misconduct</i>” by
an officer or director of a public company concerning the company, bonus and incentive
plan payments during the period of the misconduct can be recaptured by the
company. The law also says that if you
get a judgment against you for securities fraud, state homestead statutes will
not exempt your homestead. They’re
aiming at <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State> and <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>,
where you may have a lot of acres plus a home of any value. In <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>,
you have an urban homestead that no one can touch. Sarbanes-Oxley says that if you have
securities fraud with a public company, the <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>,
<st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>, and other homestead statutes
go away and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you lose</i> your homestead.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Insiders have other problems. The first two cases talk about the corporate
veil. The corporate veil can be
disregarded for fraud and some other reasons. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>DeWitt</i>, Flemming made the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cockerham</i> mistake! He did the “macho” thing and promised to
stand by his corporation. He said, “If
the corporation doesn’t pay you, I will.”</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Debaun</i>, it is
held that majority shareholders owe duties to the corporation. The bank sold their majority stake to a
madman! The judge allows the derivative
action because he wanted the money to be put into the company so that the
creditor would get paid. The attorney
for the minority shareholders could get a reasonable attorney’s fee. The controlling shareholders owe <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>heavy duties</i>. For starters, remember <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Pepper</i>. Even if they lend
money to the company, if it goes bankrupt, they’re probably going to get pushed
down the pile.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297512"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Bearer instruments</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In English speaking countries, there is no such thing as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bearer stock certificates</i>. Such certificates can be used by the bearer
for all debts, public and private, and there is no record of who has them at
any one time. You can find these
instruments in civil law countries. Both
stock certificates and bonds are typically issued in bearer form. If you have a bearer bond from a big company
in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>, for
example, that pays interest twice a year, how do you get the interest? Shipman has been told that you make sure you
don’t lose the bearer bond! You take it
to a designated bank twice a year, and they’ll stamp the back of your bond and
give you cash. Voting with bearer stock
is a similar process. You take the
certificate to a certain bank before the shareholder meeting, you get a ballot,
and you cast a vote. They make a
checkmark on the back of the certificate saying that the vote for the current
meeting has already been cast.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The state statutes all require that stock certificates be in
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>registered form</i>, in other words, the
exact opposite of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bearer</i> form. The company maintains books known as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stock transfer books</i>. Sometimes this is delegated to an independent
bank known as the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>transfer agent</i>. The board of directors will set a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>record date</i> for all shareholders’
meetings. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>holders of record </i>as of the record date <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>vote</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about dividend payments on stock? There are three big dates. There’s a declaration date when the board
declares them. Under <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
law, if it’s a cash dividend, the declaration creates a debt and the company
can’t back out unless the resolution itself states otherwise (and that’s very
rare). The date that the board meets to
declare a dividend is the declaration date. The second date is the actual <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>payment
date</i>. They will also select a date
between the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>declaration</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>payment date</i> when the dividend will be
payable to holders of record. The choice
of the dates and the spacing is governed by NASD, NYSE, AMEX, and SEC
rules. Under Rule 10b, it’s a fraud not
to comply with the rules of the NASD and the exchanges if you are a public
company. Once you notify the NASD and
exchanges of the dividend, they will set a date by which the stock will become
ex dividend, that is, a date by which a person purchasing it doesn’t get a
dividend. How are dividends paid in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>? They will be mailed out on the record date.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The governing law concerning the transfer of stock
certificates and registered debt is found in three places: Uniform Commercial
Code Articles 1, 8, and 9; ORC § 1707.04-.37 (sprinkled throughout), and the
rules of NASD, NYSE, and AMEX. Most of
the time, the former two sources will agree completely. Once in a while, though, there may be some
slack between the two. It usually
doesn’t cause a problem, but it does every once in a while.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Article 8 classifies stock in corporations as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>investment securities</i>. Nearly all courts will say that close
corporation stock, even though it’s not publicly traded, is of a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>type</i> that is publicly traded, and thus
they will apply Articles 8, 9 and 1 in full. A very small number of cases will deviate from this approach. What’s important about investment
securities? The big deal is that it’s
just like the Record Acts! A <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bona fide purchaser</i> is someone who gives
consideration, acts in good faith, and who is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i> on notice of an adverse claim.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let’s say bank B lends Mr. Smith $100,000 on Mr. Smith’s GE
stock certificates. Smith takes the
certificates to bank B and endorses them <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in
blank</i>, meaning, he doesn’t say who he’s endorsing to. The bank will put on a signature guarantee,
in case they have to foreclose on the pledge and sell the stock. The NYSE rules require a guarantee of
signature from an NYSE member firm or a bank. The loan officer is negligent and puts the certificates in his
briefcase. On the way home, he loses the
briefcase! A thief finds the briefcase
and the stock certificate endorsed in blank. The thief takes the certificates to his stock broker and the stock
broker has no reason to doubt his word that he bought the certificates from
Smith. The broker sells the certificates
through NYSE. The purchaser has 100%
title to those certificates. How does
bank B change its operations after this event? They will have Smith sign a separate piece of paper: a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stock power</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>assignment</i>. They will keep
the two documents separate at all times.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>State statutes protect the company in paying dividends. They may rely upon their books of record
unless they have actual knowledge to the contrary. But there are two exceptions to this rule:
(1) upon final dissolution, to get your money from the company, you must
present your actual certificate, which they will stamp “cancelled”, and keep
it. (2) If it’s a series of payments in
partial liquidation, you’ll have to present your certificate several
times. This is certainly cumbersome, but
the Internal Revenue Service loves it because they can trace who gets what in
dividends and interest. Some companies
have gone to a wholly electronic dividend payment system, but these are the
small minority. Most use the old paper
method.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Public offerings of debt over one year in duration have to
be in registered form to get the Internal Revenue Code § 163 interest
deduction. The Internal Revenue Service
pushed for this! But there are two
exceptions: (1) if it’s a non-public issue of debt, for example, the debt of a
close corporation, then you don’t need to comply. (2) If it’s less than one year, even if it’s
public, you don’t need to comply.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Salgo v. Matthews </i>–
This case involved an insolvent insurance company in <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>. The Federal Bankruptcy Code does not apply to
insolvent insurance companies. The
insurance departments have the power to go into state court and get
receiverships and that’s the way insolvent insurance companies are
handled. What happened here? It was a proxy fight! A big block of stock was held by an insolvent
insurance corporation. On the books of
the company where the proxy fight was taking place, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>of record</i>, all that was indicated was that the insolvent insurance
company was the holder of record. But
that wasn’t the whole story! The <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>
trial court, which is the court that appointed the receiver, had this issue
come before it and it issued an order as to how the shares in the company where
the proxy fight was taking place would be voting. The issue was whether the <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>
court’s order was valid, and whether it had to be recognized by the company
having the proxy fight. Yes! You could go “a little bit behind the
record”.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>State statutes literally require the appointment of an
important officer called the Inspector of Elections for each shareholders’
meeting. This person is important
because if there is a close or disputed item, the inspector will conduct an
administrative hearing, take evidence from lawyers for both sides, and then
will issue his certificate. He’ll
basically say, “Jones won” or “Smith won” and give his reasoning. In most states, that report is accepted in
the courts prima facie. There is a
presumption that they are correct. If
it’s a close corporation and you don’t anticipate any dispute, they’ll usually
pick one of the corporate officers and name him Inspector of Elections. If there is likely to be a dispute, they’ll
hire one of the Big Four accounting firms. If you have issues that you want to work out up front (before the
meeting) in court, in many states the only way to do so is through declaratory
judgment. If you went for a mandatory
injunction, they may say that you’re invading the responsibility of the
Inspector of Elections. But if you ask
for declaratory judgment, there may not be a problem.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ling and Co. v.
Trinity Sav. and Loan Ass’n.</i> – On the back of the stock certificate in
small print was a notice that transfer of a big block of stock probably would
require prior approval of the NYSE. The
person pledging the stock didn’t make his loan payment and the S &amp; L wanted
to foreclose and sell the stock. But
what’s the problem? The rules of the
NYSE <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>did</i> somewhat prohibit the
transfer, and those rules were not unreasonable restraints on alienation on a
common law basis. The court holds that a
straightforward interpretation of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code says
that generally speaking, restrictions on transfer must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>conspicuously </i>put on the face of the certificate (e.g. full caps or
a different color with big type). Neither one was done here! The
Uniform Commercial Code goes on to say that if it’s a bona fide mortgagee or
purchaser for value without notice of this, that person will take free of the
restriction. The court held that since
the notice hadn’t been placed conspicuously on the face of the certificate, the
trial court should determine whether the S &amp; L had actual knowledge of the
restriction at the time that they made the loan.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The second issue was whether the restriction was valid under
the Texas Corporation Code. Shipman
claims that they strained a bit, but they found that the restriction was not
unreasonable under common law, and thus it would meet the <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>
standard. The <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
standard is that unreasonable restraints on alienation are not valid, but the
case law shows that some strict restraints will be allowed, especially given a
good reason.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In these two cases, the stock certificates have been <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>genuine</i>. But forgery exists, and it’s a problem! About a dozen years ago in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
a very rich lady went to #6 bank and presented what she claimed was a
negotiable certificate of deposit from #1 bank. It had the lady’s name on it and it was for several billion dollars <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> She wanted to pledge the instrument in return
for a loan of a few billion dollars. #1
bank was very solvent. #6 made the loan,
she went through the money really fast, and they had gotten her to endorse the
certificate of deposit in blank. #6
wanted to cash the certificate at #1. #1
said that it was a forgery! The
government of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
met and bailed out #6. How could this be
avoided? If you’re worried about
forgeries and you have a negotiable instrument, the bank will want to go to
security title. #6 bank would have told
the lady to endorse it in blank. Then
they would say that as soon as they transfer the certificate to their own name
they would write her a loan check for $2 billion. Had #6 followed this procedure, #1 would have
noted the forgery and would have told #6 that she was trying to con them.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But debtors will fight security title! That’s how mortgages came up in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>! If you wanted a loan from a rich dude, then
you had to give the dude title to your land. If the dude failed to give back your deed when you paid the dude back,
you would go to the court of equity and force the dude to return the deed. Note that the parol evidence rule today still
recognizes the problem in that one of the exceptions to the rule is that if
something appears to be an absolute conveyance is actually a mortgage, then
parol evidence can be introduced to show it’s so.</p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297514"><b

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>In re Radom &amp;
Neidorff, Inc.</i> – This case talks about dissolution, which has two
“flavors”: (1) voluntary and (2) involuntary. Voluntary dissolution is governed by § 1701.86-.91, where the
shareholders vote to dissolve the corporation. That vote will give the directors authority to sell the assets and
.86-.91 will direct the directors (at their own peril!) to pay or make adequate
provision for all creditors. Then the
directors will distribute the cash left over to the shareholders. Once in a great while, it will be an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in-kind­ </i>dissolution of the
corporation. If there’s only one
shareholder, and they only own Greenacre, then the corporation can distribute
Greenacre to the sole shareholder. That’s rare, because under the Internal Revenue Code §§ 331-338, if it’s
a Sub C company, there will be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>double
tax</i>: one at the corporate level and one at the shareholder level. That’s why companies often use an LLC. The tax problems can be overcome if the sale
is set up solely for the stock of another company: the whole thing can be
tax-free!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Involuntary dissolution comes in two “sub-flavors” at common
law: a court can enter an order of dissolution when it finds (1) fraud, (2)
oppression (in a close corporation), or (3) deadlock (by statute). You’ll find these statutes in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
at § 1701.86-.91. They read very much
like the <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> statute in the
present case. So we’re looking at a
particular way of involuntarily dissolving a corporation. Here’s an important legal point: all
dissolution orders by courts are on the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equity
side</i> of the docket (as opposed to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>law
side</i>).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What are the facts of the case? We had a <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
statute that on its face was broad in the categories of deadlock and
oppression. There were two directors:
the sister and the brother who actually ran things. Was the sister an employee of the
company? She was not. Her husband had been a 50% shareholder with
her brother and when her husband died, he left his stock to her. Her husband had been an employee, but she
isn’t. The company is solvent. It’s making plenty of money because the
brother is a good businessman. This is
sort of the opposite of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hatt</i>
case. The brother and sister don’t get
along! There’s a deadlock! The board can’t do anything because a
majority can never be mustered! There’s
also a deadlock at the shareholders’ level. If there is a deadlock at the shareholders’ level, the directors stay in
place until their replacements are elected and take office. This is different from the political
arena! If the board deadlocks, the
president keeps their ongoing powers! Recall <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wilderman</i>!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At one time, the directors had agreed on the management of
the company and the brother was making money for the company. Shipman thinks that the bank signature card
for the company required the signatures of both the brother <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> the sister. Usually, only one <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>or</i> the other’s signature is needed. This is different than the case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wilderman</i>. The brother and sister are suing each
other! The sister won’t sign his salary
checks! <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But he had a very simple remedy:
he could have sued under Rule 65 for a temporary injunction. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
you would add <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i> to
that. He made a buyout offer to her, but
it was ridiculously low, even laughable. His lawyer then moves under the <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
statute for an order of dissolution. Both levels held that the statute says courts “may” enter an order of
dissolution, not “must”. Why would they
entertain the notion?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The person seeking equity must do equity. If the person seeking equity has unclean
hands and the other person doesn’t, then you don’t get your relief. If both people have unclean hands, then you
consider their “comparative rectitude”. Equity orders are heavy stuff!</p>

<p>Deadlocks are fairly common in closely-held corporations. It’s not uncommon to see these kinds of
disputes arise, and they’re pretty difficult. What’s the lawyer’s duty in this kind of case? The <st1:City><st1:place>ABA</st1:place></st1:City>
says that if there is dissention within the “corporate family”, you take orders
from the majority bloc of the board of directors. But here, we go a level beyond that. The board of directors is split and
fighting. The <st1:City><st1:place>ABA</st1:place></st1:City>
says that you can’t represent <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gearing v. Kelly </i>–
Here we have two families that come together to start a corporation. Let’s say that each has 100 shares out of 200
shares outstanding total. The company
they form has no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cumulative voting</i>,
it has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>straight voting</i>. Straight voting means that if you own 100
shares and there are four directors all elected annually (that is, the board is
not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>classified</i> – divided into two or
three classes where some are elected each year and others are elected in
alternate years), and they haven’t opted to have cumulative voting in the
charter, then for each of the four spots, you can cast 100 votes. To put it another way, you cannot <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>accumulate</i> more than 100 votes and
spread them as you wish.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
the rule is that if the charter is silent, then it’s straight voting, but if
the charter has a cumulative voting clause then cumulative voting will be
allowed. Cumulative voting is not
consistent with regular political voting in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United

and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
proportional representation is frowned upon. Instead, it’s “first around the post”, and the person who gets the
plurality wins. There were three
presidential candidates in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
in 1992. <st1:City><st1:place>Clinton</st1:place></st1:City>
got way less than 50%. The first around
the post was <st1:City><st1:place>Clinton</st1:place></st1:City>, and thus he
got all of <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>’s electoral
votes. <st1:State><st1:place>Nebraska</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>Maine</st1:place></st1:State> are the only states
with a proportional system. In many
parliamentary systems proportional representation is encouraged, and some of
them even use cumulative voting.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The essence of cumulative voting is that you take the number
of directors to be elected, multiply it by the number of shares you own, take
the product and you can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>distribute it</i>
as you wish. In good times, the company
gave each of the two families two directors. They went into the annual meeting and agreed to cast a joint ballot of
the two shareholders, giving each side two directors. But one of the directors from one side
resigns due to disputes that have arisen. The <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> statute at
that time said that the board of directors, in the case of a death or
resignation, could elect a successor unless the articles of incorporation
stated otherwise. But there was no
special quorum dispensation and no special dispensation on number of votes
needed (<st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> has a different
statutory scheme and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gearing</i> problem
can arise more easily here than in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let’s say Jones director #2 resigns. Smith #1, the chairman of the board, can call
a special meeting of the directors. All
statutes and all bylaws and all charters will give him that power. He gives proper notice of the time, place,
and purpose of the meeting, namely, to elect a successor to Jones #2. If you have a four person board of directors,
the ordinary quorum requirement will be three, a majority. If one director resigns or dies, the ordinary
quorum requirement <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>remains the same</i>:
a majority of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>full</i> board of
directors. So Jones #1 boycotts the
meeting at which Smith #1 and Smith #2 elect Smith #3 to the board of
directors. Jones #1 brings an election
review proceeding. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
you would go to the county prosecutor to get them to bring a quo warranto
action. The judge will appoint the other
side’s lawyer to present their side.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What’s quo warranto? It’s half civil and half criminal! It translates to: “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>By what right</i>
do you hold an alleged office?” Jones #1
says that if she showed up, the Smiths would have screwed her over by
appointing Smith #3. She claims that the
only way she could keep the balance from shifting was to boycott the vote. It’s an appealing argument, but what does the
court hold? They say that Jones #1 was
bad because she purposely didn’t show! Thus, they don’t give her any relief. How do you avoid the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gearing</i>
problem with two different classes of stock (class “J” and class “S”)? How do you handle death, resignation, or
disability under the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statutes? Stick with situations where
there is an even number of directors.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A word about statutes: the first thing you do is read them
carefully. Use the plain meaning of the
text first; that’s where you start. Most
of the time that’s also where you end. But, later in the course, we will spend time with fiduciary duties,
which are largely a product of court decisions. Legislatures, by and large, leave the issue up to the courts. Fiduciary duties can take strange twists and
turns.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Statutes usually have a long list of definitions at the
front, and R.C. Chapter 1701 is no exception. In the old days, these definitions were alphabetical, but about 25 years
ago, they gave up, and thus they are no longer alphabetical. We need to read these definitions carefully,
noting that they’re in no particular order.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Also, note that the statutes in our little books are about
15 months out of date. Make sure you
check the law reporter for something that is totally up to date.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297517"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Requirements for a valid vote</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It was held in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gearing
</i>that the woman, by purposefully being absent from the meeting, sort of
“dirtied her hands” in a way that equity is not available to her. This case ties in to the issue of what makes
for a valid vote by directors or by shareholders. There are four requirements:</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc76297518"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Valid call</b></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There must be a valid <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>call</i>
by a person having the authority to call. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gearing</i>, for example, the
guy on the other side appears to have the power to call. By way of explanation, the statutes
distinguish between annual meetings versus other meetings scheduled by the
charter or regulations (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>special </i>meetings). In general, the people in charge of a company
will give notice of general or annual meetings. The O.R.C. requires that for shareholders’ meetings. As to directors’ meetings, however, the
O.R.C. appears to say that the notice for directors of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>either</i> special or general meetings need not state the purpose. That is contrary to the common law, and if
you’re the chairman of the board, you ignore this in practice and give decent
notice anyway with the purpose.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc76297519"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Valid notice as to time, place, and purpose</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>notice </i>must be
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>valid</i> as to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>time</i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>place</i>, and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purpose</i>. The rules are slightly different for shareholders as opposed to
directors. At common law, if it is a
regular meeting, in theory, notice need not be given. But in practice, you should not rely on that
rule, especially if you’re a public company. If you’re a public company, you must follow SEC rules.<br>
<br>
How much lead time do you have to give? Check your charter, bylaws, and state statutes and find out how much
notice is required and how you compute it. Be careful! R.C. 1701.02 says
there is a “mailbox rule”, more or less. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>But</i>…Shipman says this is
probably unconstitutional under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tulsa
Collection</i>, a U.S. Supreme Court opinion written by Justice O’Connor. This is part of the line of cases defining
procedural due process for state action. It’s a long line of cases that starts with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Mullane</i> from the 1940s. That
case involved the settlement of common trust funds. Banks got the <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
legislature to pass a statute that individual notice didn’t have to be given to
settlees, but rather than publication in a newspaper in <st1:City><st1:place>Manhattan</st1:place></st1:City>
would be enough. Justice Jackson wrote the
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>seminal</i> procedural due process
opinion of all time, and said that this procedure isn’t valid under the
Fourteenth Amendment! For known
beneficiaries, he said, notice must be given by ordinary mail.<br>
<br>
In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tulsa Collection</i>, a will was
admitted to probate in <st1:State><st1:place>Oklahoma</st1:place></st1:State>. The <st1:State><st1:place>Oklahoma</st1:place></st1:State>
statute provided that notice must be given within 60 days after publication in
an <st1:State><st1:place>Oklahoma</st1:place></st1:State> newspaper of the
death of the decedent and those who didn’t meet the deadline were <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>forever barred</i>! The facts were that the decedent had a big
debt to the hospital for his last illness. The executor was very aware of this and gave no actual notice to the
hospital. The hospital failed to meet
the deadline! Thus, the executor says:
you’re out of luck! Justice O’Connor
held that in a “garden-variety” case, there is no state action for purposes of
the Fourteenth Amendment. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>But</i>, she says, where there is a sharp,
Draconian period, it won’t govern as to creditors that the executor <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knew</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>should have known</i> about (because it ain’t “garden-variety”!). As to those people, individual notice by
ordinary mail and a decently long statute of limitations is required. Therefore, the hospital wasn’t cut off from
filing their personal claim in the probate proceeding.<br>
<br>
Another big case just before <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tulsa Collection</i>
was a mortgage foreclosure in <st1:State><st1:place>Indiana</st1:place></st1:State>,
where a first mortgage was foreclosed. Everyone knew that there was a second mortgage and the address of the
holder of that second mortgage was known to everyone. Justice Marshall said that individual notice
by ordinary mail was required by the Fourteenth Amendment. If you put those cases together, R.C. 1701.02
appears to violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Besides, now we have fax machines and the internet, and thus it makes no
sense! In a close corporation, you would
generally know how to reach the directors and shareholders by fax or
e-mail. If you need to give five days
advance notice, just fax it! So you
wouldn’t follow R.C. 1701.02 even if it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were</i>
constitutional.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Isn’t this a little tedious? No, you need to be tedious to get the job done! To get everything right, you better double
check the requirements. It’s not simple!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc76297520"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Quorum requirement</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Check if the quorum requirement is met! Look at the statute, regulations, and the charter,
and if there is a special agreement under R.C. 1701.591, you must look at that
too. Those agreements are kind of rare,
though. If you have four directors and
one resigns, then the quorum remains at <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>three</i>
(a majority of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>full membership</i>). But a quorum need not mean a majority. Maybe it means that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>everyone</i> must be there!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two big exceptions: (1) Ohio’s statute says: if
there is a vacancy in the board of directors due to death, resignation, total
disability, etc., then “unless the articles are to the contrary, the remaining
directors can fill the vacancy <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>even if</i>
the remaining directors are less than a quorum”. This makes the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Gearing </i>problem worse in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
than it was in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>! (2) What quorum of shareholders is needed to
elect directors? It’s tricky! In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
by statute, one-third or more of the outstanding shares must be represented <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in person </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>by proxy</i>. Proxy means that
you get permission from another shareholder to vote on their behalf at a
certain meeting on a certain date. That
piece of paper is called the proxy. The
person who holds it is called the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>proxy
agent</i>. For a big public company,
they will solicit your proxy, as required by federal law. You sign the proxy card and they will send
you a stamped return envelope, you put it in the envelope and return it. Almost all proxies are revocable, because
it’s an agency that’s seldom coupled with an interest. The interest of the proxy agent in voting,
standing by itself, is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> enough to
make it an agency coupled with an interest.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Consider the situation under the Model Business Corporation
Act. If you have a four person board and
one person dies, then three is a quorum. If you have the three living directors show up and you have a 2-1 vote,
you have good action. One yes and two
abstentions under the common law is not good action. But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cullen
v. Milligan</i> held that if you’re present and abstain from a vote on
dividends, it counts as a yes.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What are the exceptions again? Let’s say Smith is the President and CEO of Smith,
Inc., which is a corporation. Smith owns
100% of the stock. The company runs a
mid-sized grocery store. The problem is
that the corporation is having financial difficulties. Mr. Smith talks to Mr. Jones and asks Jones
to sign a two-year contract with the corporation as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>general manager</i> (not an officer). Part of the deal is that Mr. Jones will lend the company $200,000. Mr. Jones’s lawyer says Jones will do this
only if Smith gives Jones an irrevocable proxy to vote his stock during the two
year period. Smith agrees and writes out
a document as an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>irrevocable proxy</i>. The last paragraph says: “This is a proxy
coupled with an interest, and it is irrevocable for the two year period.” According to the Restatement Second, that
will be a valid, irrevocable proxy for the two years because it’s coupled with
an interest.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>New York and Delaware, by statute, go even further, saying
that if Jones doesn’t lend any money but simply agrees to be general manager
for two years under a two-year signed contract, that if a proxy is given and it
is stated to be irrevocable, then it will (by golly!) be irrevocable because
the statute says so! <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
doesn’t have a comparable provision. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
you would go under the common law or R.C. 1701.591.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, when
it comes to election of directors, the statute itself imposes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no quorum requirement whatsoever</i>. Thus, in theory, if a company had 1 million
outstanding shares and Mr. Jones, owner of one share, was the only guy who
showed up to a duly called meeting to elect directors, then unless the charter
or regulations provide otherwise, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mr.
Jones is a valid quorum</i>! This seems
like a shock, but this is true of presidential elections too! If only 10% of the people voted, the election
would be just as valid as if 40% of people voted!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc76297521"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Valid vote</b></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In all states, once there is a valid quorum at the
shareholders meeting, the vote requirement is simple. You need a plurality. It’s the English/U.S. “first around the post”
political scheme. It’s non-proportional
representation!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Shareholders can vote by proxy, but directors cannot. They vote only if they show up at a
meeting. But there are two
exceptions. <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> statutes say that if you
have a valid telephonic hookup on which all directors can speak to each other,
then the vote taken telephonically will be binding. The statutes also provide a handy tool:
action can be taken without a meeting <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i>
you have all directors or shareholders sign a document whereby they assent to a
certain action! The signatures need not
be on the same document if you send out counterparts to everybody and they sign
and return them by fax or mail. You can
collect up the piece of paper and collectively it will be enough. You can even have a joint meeting of
shareholders and directors!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
there’s a statute that sets out the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>consent
procedure</i>. If Smith owns 51% of
Smith, Inc., which can be a public or private company, then Smith, without a
meeting, can file a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>consent</i> which
will be just as valid as if a meeting took place. Shipman considers this <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>barbaric!</i> But there are two
cautions: if it’s a public company, then under § 14(c) of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, you have to send of notice to all shareholders. Once the action is taken, the statutes
generally require that minority shareholders be advised. We only have this procedure in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
in a couple of specialized sections. One
of them is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>waiver of preemptive rights</i>
under R.C. 1701.15.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Suppose the articles provide for four directors, three of
whom are present. The fourth has
died. The remaining directors haven’t
elected a replacement yet, and the articles of incorporation preclude that
procedure. The three directors show up. That’s a quorum, unless the articles require
more. Let’s say valid notice has been
given. If the vote on a resolution is
3-0, then unless the articles or regulations provide otherwise, that’s a valid
board action! What if the board votes
2-1? It’s tricky! If the regulations or the charter require a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>majority</i> of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>four</i>, then 2-1 doesn’t cut it. In many states, that will be valid action, and that’s why in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gearing</i> the lady didn’t show up. What if there’s one vote for and two
abstentions? There’s a quorum. Do we match the one against the one voting,
or do we match it against the three who aren’t voting? Generally, this will not constitute board
action. There is some material in the
Revised Model Act that goes the other way.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cullen v. Milligan</i>
is an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> case involving R.C.
1701.95, which says that for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purposes of
liability </i>on dividends, a director who is present and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>does not vote no</i> will be deemed to have voted <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>yes</i>. The only way to avoid
liability under R.C. 1701.95 is to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vote</i>. The question in the case was whether the
statute applies to issues <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other than</i>
dividends, and the answer was no, it doesn’t. In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State> and most
United States jurisdictions, directors are far more “under the gun” than in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. The common law rule, codified by statutes in
most states, says that in order to avoid liability as a director on an issue,
if you’re present you must (1) affirmatively vote <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>no</i> and then (2) turn to the corporate secretary and say “Please
enter in the corporate minutes my formal dissent from the board action!” If you’re absent from a meeting, you must get
the minutes as fast as possible, and if you disagree with what the board did,
you must register your dissent by registered mail to the corporate secretary.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What’s the big deal? The majority rule is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very
counterintuitive</i> to laymen and a lot of lawyers. If you’re a director of a <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation and they’re doing something foolish, you need to vote no and also
make sure it’s reflected in the minutes that you dissent. The <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
rule isn’t so demanding, because if you turn to the secretary and say “I vote
no”, then you don’t have to take the second step of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>formally</i> entering a dissent to the board of directors. The majority rule is not only
counterintuitive, but it also builds up bad relations on the board. It’s annoying enough to vote no! But when you turn to the secretary and
dictate your dissent, it really ticks people off! But there is a time not only to vote no, but
to make sure you enter your dissent into the minutes. The way corporate cultures operate, once directors
get the agenda for a meeting and they decide they’ll vote no, they tell the
other directors in advance. This is
often enough to kill the action.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>As to shareholder votes, in Delaware, the general rule is
that, unless the articles provide otherwise, when shareholders act on matters <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other than</i> election of directors, for
the shareholder vote to be valid, over 50% of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all outstanding shares</i> must be voted affirmatively. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
the rule is stricter: if the articles and regulations are silent, then for a
lot of actions (like merger) the requirement goes up to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>two-thirds</i>. If you are a
public company, you will hire a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>proxy-soliciting
firm</i> such as D.H. King Co. If the
meeting has been validly called and valid notice has been given then if a
majority of those <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>present</i> vote <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>yes</i>, then you’re okay. You see how abstentions can screw things up.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you have an even number of directors, cumulative voting
will generally prevent a deadlock in the election of directors. If there are an odd number of directors, it
usually will not help. For more
information, look at Aranov &amp; Einhorn’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Proxy
Contests</i>. It’s old, but good.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here is the math. First, you can’t form a company in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
with straight voting. Your initial
formation must be with cumulative voting. However, if you go to R.C. 1701.61-.72, you’ll find that after
formation, if you get the requisite shareholder vote, you can amend the
articles to go to straight voting. The
required vote will usually be (1) two-thirds plus (2) if the vote against is
enough to elect one director, then the amendment doesn’t pass.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Say you have four directors. All of them are elected annually. The majority of the directors want to go to straight voting. They call a meeting under R.C. 1701.72. Frank is a minority shareholder who owns 21
shares. He can elect one director. So if he votes no, we can’t switch to
straight voting. But that’s not the end
of the story. The majority can form a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mirror image </i><st1:State><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Delaware</i></st1:place></st1:State><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> corporation</i>, and if your articles are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>silent</i> on cumulative voting, then there
is no cumulative voting. <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
is like most states! Then they can merge
the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> and <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
companies, which will require two-thirds of the outstanding vote. But what’s the problem? On the merger of the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
company into the <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
company, Frank will be entitled to appraisal rights and the fair market value
of his 21 shares <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in cash</i>. If he held only 20 shares, the charter
amendment could go through and there would be no appraisal rights.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here are a few more procedural points on the Ohio system: it
will be straight voting unless one or more shareholders states before the
meeting that it will be cumulative voting and the secretary gives notice to
everyone that it’s going to be cumulative voting. Why? If someone thinks it’s straight voting and shows up and it’s really
cumulative voting, that person will get screwed. Cumulative voting works only if everyone
knows the rules in advance. That’s
fairly common in all states.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let’s prove the deal with odd and even numbers of
directors. Let’s say we have an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation whose charter says nothing about cumulative voting, meaning that
there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> cumulative voting, because
the statute says so. There are 200
shares outstanding. Smith owns 100 and
Jones owns 100. There are four directors,
and they are all elected annually, that is, it’s not a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>classified</i> board of directors.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How will the two sides likely vote? From game theory, we assume that each side
uses <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>minimax</i> theory, meaning that
each side is highly rational and will vote to minimize harm to themselves while
maximizing the upside. This is a
rational model, which isn’t to say that it always reflects the real world. So how will the two sides likely vote? Take the number of shares times the number of
directors to be elected. Thus, each side
has 400 votes. The statute says that you
can accumulate and spread among one or more of the four as you wish to maximize
your situation. The ballot will likely
come back with 200 votes for each of Jones-1, Jones-2, Smith-1, and Smith-2. Let’s assume all the requirements for a valid
vote have been met and that there has been notice given that cumulative voting
will be happening. The Inspector of
Elections issues a certificate of the result. There were only four candidates, and therefore a new board will take
over! If any of these people are
different from the old directors, the old people will be pushed out!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here is a different case: say there are only 3 directors,
all elected annually. One or both sides
demands cumulative voting and the secretary gives notice. There is proper call of meeting, proper
notice of time, place and purpose, the charter is silent concerning cumulative
voting, meaning that in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
voting will be cumulative. (In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
if the charter is silent, we’ll have straight voting.) Jones-1, Jones-2, Smith-1, and Smith-2 will
all get 150 votes! But then there’s a
deadlock! No one is elected! There are no three directors with a plurality
over the fourth! The result is that the
Inspector of Elections will enter an order than no directors were elected at
the meeting and that the old board of directors carries over. Don’t forget that in the corporate world,
when it comes to directors and officers, you’re elected to serve for a term
plus so much longer, if needed, until your successors are duly elected and
qualified. (What does qualified
mean? When someone gets elected to be a
director or officer, have them send a letter of acceptance.) Cumulative voting prevents deadlock in the
election of directors only when there is an even number of directors.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How do we get around this? In the Jones/Smith hypothetical, there are three Joneses and three
Smiths who want to be active in the company. Each is contributing a lot of cash. Let’s say we’re counsel for the Jones family and a different firm is
counsel for the Smith family, while a third firm altogether is counsel for the
new company, to be formed.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How do we advise Ms. Jones, who will be the CEO, and who
will have two sons active in the business as directors? How do we avoid the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Gearing</i> problem? We can set
the board at six, and since that’s an even number, we’ll get three from each
family. But that doesn’t deal with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gearing</i>! What happens if the two sons get killed in an accident? The other side can call a director’s meeting
and replace the two sons with directors favorable to their side, and you’d be
stuck that way until at least the next annual meeting.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>One way to get around this is with a R.C. 1701.591
shareholder agreement. But these aren’t
used much. The legal fees are pretty
high! Also, you have the same problem
that you have with prenuptial agreements. A third of the time, you can’t negotiate the agreement! And if you can’t negotiate the agreement,
maybe you shouldn’t get married! Also,
if you get too much down on paper, you won’t get a deal. Also, sometimes when you get lawyers
involved, they’ll want to kill a deal over a very small provision.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So what if we have two classes of stock, let’s say Class J
and Class S? Under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law, you can have two classes and you can have the charter provide that the two
classes are exactly the same except that each class will annually elect three
directors, voting separately. You can
provide further that no board of directors’ action will be valid unless at
least one member of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>each</i> class of
directors votes yes. Then, to go against
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gearing</i> and the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statute, you can provide that if there is a vacancy in the J directors, then
just the Class J shareholders will be called to a meeting in order to vote for
a replacement. You can provide that the
board of directors will have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>zero power</i>
to vote for a replacement.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>You can also have Class J voting, Class J non-voting, Class
S voting and Class S non-voting. If the
big kahunas of each family want to give gifts of shares without screwing up
voting powers, then the kahunas can give non-voting stock. You can have classes of stock that are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>almost</i> entirely non-voting in many
states. However, in other states, all
shares must have a vote. Sometimes the
statutes and constitutions don’t mean what they say! Maybe the founders have shares with 100 votes
per share, but the publicly issued stock will have 1 vote per share. Often, that will satisfy state statutes and
the state constitution. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
in a given class, each share in a class must have the same voting rights
according to R.C. 1701.44. In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
the rule is different. In <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Providence &amp; Worcester</i>, a clause
said that if you own 300 shares or less, you have 1 vote per share, but if you
own more than 300 shares, than you only have 1/10<sup>th</sup> of a vote per
share. This was in the original charter
of the old railroad, and it served as an anti-takeover provision. Later, as applied to Cincinnati Millicron,
there was a shareholder vote to have the same thing, and <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
courts allowed them to add this clause. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, however, a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P &amp; W</i> provision is not allowed. You would have to have different classes of
shares in order to have different voting rights.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> case
in the 1880’s against Rockefeller and his trusts were the source of the term
“antitrust”. There are several federal
antitrust statutes (such as the Sherman Antitrust Act), and in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
we have the Valentine Act. Tomorrow,
we’ll cover ultra vires and read the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Litwin
</i>case. In that case, we’ll find that
what the officers and directors did was contrary to the bank’s charter. The plaintiffs’ shareholder derivative action
had two counts: (1) negligence and (2) ultra vires. The plaintiffs claimed that since what the
officers and directors did was ultra vires, they had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>liability without fault</i> (i.e. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strict
liability</i>). The court said that the
plaintiffs had it wrong. They said that
in the corporation area if what an officer or director does is ultra vires,
it’s not strict liability, but rather <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>evidence
of negligence</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Why did the plaintiff make the argument that he did? In the trust area, if you’re a trustee or an
executor or administrator of an estate, and you do something ultra vires, the
trust rule generally <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> that of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>absolute liability without fault</i>. That rule is related to a rule on conflicts
of interest. Unless a trust instrument provides
otherwise, a trustee who sells stock to the trust which later goes down in
value has absolute liability. Fault need
not be shown. In the corporate world, if
(1) a conflict of interest is fully and fairly disclosed up front, (2) there’s
no injury to creditors and (3) what the director or officer did was reasonable
then there is a defense. It can be hard
to show those three things.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Why is there a difference between the corporate arena and
the law of trust? The law of trust and
executors and administrators is designed to deal with the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>conservation of capital</i>, and the law of business associations deals
with the same thing. However, the law of
business associations is more entrepreneurial in that it also takes into
consideration reasonable risk taking and growth of capital. We’ll see this again in Wills, Trusts, and
Estates. The ultra vires stuff is
important. What is the lawyer’s role? What are their possible liabilities?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>Attorney opinions</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In a major corporate transaction, the third party dealing
with the corporation will usually ask his counsel <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and</i> the lawyer for the corporation whether the contract has been <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>duly and validly adopted </i>by the
corporation and is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>binding </i>on the
corporation in accordance with the terms of the contract. This includes, if needed, the approval of the
board of directors, and, if needed, the approval of shareholders, but most
transactions, even if fairly large, don’t require board and/or shareholder
approval. The officers of the company
can do a lot by themselves. We will see
more on the authority of officers. The
lawyer will have to draw up a memo saying whether <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>shareholder approval </i>is needed, whether it has been <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>obtained</i>, if the shareholders are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entitled to appraisal rights</i>, whether
you need the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>approval of the board of
directors</i>, whether there has been a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>validly
called meeting</i>, whether <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>papers have
been circulated</i>, whether you have the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>right
vote</i>, and finally whether the officers <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>have
the authority </i>to do what they’re purported to do.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The attorney for the corporation may want to strike the word
“duly” and leave “validly”. The two
terms are not synonyms! If they were
synonymous, they wouldn’t both be used. “Validly” means that “the holy water may not have been sprinkled on
right, but it’s still a valid transaction.” When you add “duly”, it means that it’s been performed “in a way that
would please a grand hall monitor, superintendent of an authoritarian school;
square corners have been turned and everything has been done right.” You have to get the right papers at
closing! You can have big headaches in
court in the future, even if you win!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the last 15 years, the Silverado accords have become a
big deal. Some lawyers had a retreat and
talked about how opinions ought to be worded. If you’re asked to give an opinion subject to the Silverado accords,
don’t sign it right away! Double check
the definitions! They’re “wacky!” Careful lawyers will add reservations related
to environmental laws, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>RICO</i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equity orders</i>, and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>doctrines of good faith and commercial reasonableness</i>. They will also add a section dealing with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraudulent conveyance statutes</i>. “They are murder!” Sometimes you can’t get around this stuff,
though. To limit costs, sometimes the
other side will accept an opinion of the corporate counsel if, to the best of
their knowledge (not having audited or anything like that), “X, Y, and Z are
true”. Then there will be a paragraph
that describes when the firm is on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>notice</i>
of certain facts. The point is that this
is tough stuff. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In opinions, you’ll
always have to consider ultra vires.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Some big limiting factors on corporate power are loan
agreements, mortgages, notes, and other instruments that you’ve signed with
creditors. The other side will ask for
an opinion saying that these old agreements don’t run against the new one. So ultra vires is a big deal! Pay attention to it! It’s very important in practice!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The naming of corporations and LLCs is mostly, but not
entirely, a matter of state law. There
are two or three things you can do. In
most states, you can pay $10 or $15 to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reserve
a name</i> for 30-60 days.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Trademarks,
service marks, and trade dress overlap with local statutes somewhat. There is also the Lanham Act that allows many
of these suits to be brought in federal court. These statutes are distant relatives of the patent and copyright
statutes. They’re sort of types of
intellectual property statutes.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In all states, when you authorize the issuance of stock, you
must describe it as either common or preferred stock and you must give the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>par value</i> for the stock. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
by a recent amendment, you can name the initial directors in the articles of
incorporation. It used to be the case
that there was an incorporators meeting, and essentially things got
complicated. So the new, simpler method
is better. Also, in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
you’ll have to have a shareholders’ meeting early on because only the
shareholders can adopt the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>permanent
regulation</i>s.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297524"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Regulations and bylaws</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What we in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
call regulations are called bylaws everywhere else, including <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
the shareholders must adopt the permanent regulations with a couple of minor
exceptions found in the statute. That’s
populist. At the other extreme, <st1:State><st1:place>Indiana</st1:place></st1:State>
requires the directors to propose and the shareholders to vote upon any
proposal to amend the bylaws. That means
shareholders acting by themselves cannot amend the bylaws! In the middle is <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
which is very complicated. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Either</i> the directors or shareholders
may, at a meeting properly called with proper notice, adopt or amend bylaw
provisions. However, the board of
directors can’t tinker with what the shareholders have done. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and two other states, the shareholders, acting alone, can also amend the
articles of incorporation! We’re also
one of the few states where shareholders, acting alone, can vote to dissolve
the corporation. There’s a lot of work
in advance that goes into forming a corporation. There are tax factors, licensing, zoning,
permits, bank account forms, insurance, and all kinds of other things.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Lastly, all states have provisions concerning <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>foreign corporation</i> (meaning
out-of-state) qualifying to do business in that state, e.g. R.C. Chapter
1703. Why do we have these? (1) They’re a big aid to the tax authorities
to know who to tax. (2) One of the
requirements of these statutes is to designate a registered agent for service
of process. Let’s say a <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation has its main offices in <st1:City><st1:place>New York City</st1:place></st1:City>. If it’s subject to Chapter 1703, they must
file a consent to service of process. They will often name a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>corporation
service company</i>, such as CT Corp. They must also have a registered office in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. CT Corp. can provide that for them too.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Why do people resist this so much? The consent to service of process statutes
don’t stop with torts in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
but govern torts worldwide! If you’re a <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation with your main office in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
and you’re qualified to do business in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
but also do business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
you can be sued in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>! But how do these statutes fare under the
Dormant Commerce Clause? The U.S.
Supreme Court has held that if there is some kind of business operation, like
an office or store or property or mine in the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
then that breaks the chain of interstate commerce enough for <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
to regulate the business. If the
corporation simply mails things into <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
then even though <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> courts
would have jurisdiction over that company in a products liability case, the
Dormant Commerce Clause precludes Chapter 1703 from applying.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bendix</i> was a case
regarding Chapter 1703 and also a separate <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tolling
</i>statute in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. That statute says if a defendant in an action
has been out of the state, then in computing whether the statute of limitations
has run, you “carve out” the period of absence and don’t count that. Bendix was an <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation that delivered equipment to an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
vendee and installed it in the vendee’s plant. Chapter 1703 exempts that from having to qualify to do business in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. Four years and two months later, a fraud suit
against Bendix was started in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
courts. (Remember that delivering and
installing machinery constitutes minimum contacts if there’s a long-arm
statute!) Also remember that the
plaintiff’s complaint must clearly plead why he is within the statute of
limitations. The vendee said that based
on the absence statute, the company could have qualified to do business in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
but they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>didn’t</i> qualify to do
business in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, and thus
they’re absent from <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>! But Justice Kennedy held that the statute was
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>discriminatory </i>against interstate
commerce, and the tolling statute was knocked down. With the tolling statute knocked down, the
general <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> four-year fraud
statute of limitations booted the vendee out of court! The question is: why the heck did they wait
that long? There’s malpractice
somewhere. So unless you can find a
compelling state interest to justify the restriction on interstate commerce,
the statute goes down as unconstitutional!</p>

Boss signed a contract with the plaintiffs, an architecture firm, to build a

be formed in <st1:State><st1:place>Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>. Boss formed a company with a different name

hotel. How sued Boss personally for
unpaid fees. Should Boss be personally
liable for the debts of the nonexistent corporation? Boss, as a promoter, will
be personally responsible for the debts of the corporation he was to form
unless it was understood and intended that the new corporation to be formed
will be the sole obligor. Boss is held
personally liable for the debt to How. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Check out the signature lines! Ed Boss signs for a <st1:State><st1:place>Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation that hasn’t been formed yet! The corporation is to be the obligor. But the corporation <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>isn’t formed</i>
and there’s a suit by the architect against the promoter. This case represents the majority view in
American law. It’s even more the
majority view under English law. How
come? It’s an axiom of agency law that
if there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-existent principal</i>
and the agent knows it, and the agent signs on behalf of the non-existent
principal, then the agent is absolutely liable. Does this seem harsh? Courts want
someone liable on the contract. They
don’t want legal “airballs” out there. Is there American authority to the contrary? Yes, in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Quaker Hill</i> case in the notes, the vendor <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>twisted the promoter’s arm</i>, and the promoter signed the way that
Boss did. They found that the usual rule
was not fair under those facts. But
that’s a minority rule.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What happens if the corporation is formed? If the corporation is formed and you have a highly
formal document, namely, a 3-way novation agreement, then it will clearly be
valid. A novation is a recognized
“animal” of contract law. But things
usually aren’t that simple!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McArthur</i> case
talks about ratification and adoption, which are agency terms both in tort and
in contract. In torts, we learn that
even if there is no authorization up front and even if respondeat superior
doesn’t apply, if the principal <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ratifies</i>
the tort afterwards, then you may sue the actual tortfeasor <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> the principal. For example, if you’re a bus company
superintendent and a driver comes in saying: “I socked this dude on the bus to
teach him a lesson because he was annoying me”, and then the superintendent
says: “I woulda hit him three times”, then that is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>implied ratification</i>, and the company will be liable. Ratification can be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>implied</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How does this come up in the context of pre-incorporation
contracts? In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>McArthur</i>, we’re in <st1:State><st1:place>Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>
in the 1880’s. First off, the promoter
and employee orally agree on a 14 month employee contract. On April 2, the corporation is formed and the
board of directors meets. They have
knowledge of the oral contract of employment made by the promoter in
January. They approve! Then, on July 2, the employee is dismissed without
cause. The employee sues for damages
against the corporation. It’s not an
action for specific performance! It’s a
legal action.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What’s wrong here? In
the old days, and the new days in some states, partial performance doesn’t take
a contract outside of the statute of frauds. At the time, there was no strong partial performance doctrine! The employee says that this was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ratified</i> by the board of directors, and
therefore the corporation is bound. The
corporation gives two defenses: (1) under British law and many American states,
if the principal was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not in existence </i>when
the agent made the contract, then there can be no ratification because the
ratification relates back to the original event, and there was no corporation
in existence on that date! Besides, if
you relate it back to that date, you’re in violation of the statute of
frauds! So this seems like a good
argument. But what the court held was
that there is a separate of related doctrine of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>adoption</i>, and that the board could not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ratify </i>on April 2, but it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could</i>
“hop over one compartment” and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>adopt</i>,
which doesn’t relate back to January 2. When we put the day at April 2, there are 11 months to go, and there is
no statute of frauds problem. The
doctrine of restitution would apply to any corporation that is formed.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about the lawyer who does the work of bringing a
corporation into existence? Does the
lawyer have a right to get paid when the corporation is born? The cases are split. Let’s say Peter Promoter walks into your
office with his wife, Paula. They want
to promote a company and it will take a lot of complicated and detailed
work. Can a lawyer represent both of
them? You have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>dual clients</i>. Under Canons
5, 4, and 9 of the Ohio Code of Professional Responsibility, you must warn them
(1) of the potential conflicts between them, (2) that there is no strict
attorney-client privilege and that what one tells you can be discovered by the
other, and (3) that there would be advantages to each one having their separate
attorney. If, knowing this, they still
want you to represent them, that’s fine, with a major caveat: on every major
matter, you would have to stop and explain how the major matter is favorable
and unfavorable to each client. It’s a
same thing when a married couple comes in and wants you to craft both their
wills. This can get hairy!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here’s a widely used hypo from CLE symposia: H &amp; W come
in and want you to draft both of their wills. The ordinary will is fully revocable until the person dies and/or goes
crazy (AKA “lose mental capacity”). You
draft the wills, and married couples will usually leave to each other. Three months later, W calls, saying that she
wants a new will drafted leaving everything to her lover. So the first question is whether you can do
that. Of course you can’t! What else do you have to do? At a bare minimum, you must phone the husband
and tell him, at minimum, that you can no longer represent him vis-à-vis the
will, that you’re no longer representing the wife, and that he should
immediately go to a new lawyer to make a new will revoking the old one. You also have to tell the wife that you can
no longer represent her at all. Representing joint clients can get sticky! Some say you have to tell H about the
lover. Shipman supposes they’ll get the
message when you tell them to go get a new lawyer and a new will. What if the husband says, “Why are you
telling me this?” You want to make sure
that nobody gets killed. Later, we’ll
talk about quasi-clients in the corporate area: they’re not quite joint clients,
but you incur the same duties. There are
also third-party non-clients who are in privity of contract with you, for
example: if you represent a corporation selling Greenacre to a third-party, and
that party wants your opinion that the contract is cool, and you address the
opinion to that party, that is a third-party non-client who is in privity with
you. You can be liable in negligence on
the opinion to him!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here’s a hypo we were supposed to think about: Mrs. Smith
wants to buy some land for a corporation that hasn’t been formed yet. She doesn’t want the land for herself, but
only for the corporation. Can she assure
that the land is available if she forms the corporation? She’s not sure if she can get loan from her
husband and parents. We’ll represent
Smith and the corporation but not anybody else because the conflicts are too
strong. From <st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stanley</i></st1:place></st1:City><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> J. How</i>, we find that a contract between
the corporation to be formed and the owner would leave her holding the bag if
the corporation <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>isn’t</i> formed. The thing to do is to pay the guy to have an
option running a few weeks. The option
states that it may be assigned to a corporation to be formed. If the formation of the corporation goes
ahead, she assigns the option to the corporation for the cost of the
option. If the corporation doesn’t get
formed, she’s only out a few hundred dollars for the cost of the option.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If a corporation was either a corporation de jure (meaning
in perfect compliance) or de facto, nobody can complain about the errors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Last time, we had worked our way through
Assignment 10(d) and cases under the old Model Business Corporation Act. Under that Draconian and straightforward
position, are you going to hold <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mere
inactive investors</i> to the same liability standard that you hold active
investors? The courts said no, because
the very purpose of corporate statutes is to encourage investment especially by
inactive investors and you don’t want to be Draconian. Note that in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State> statutes such R.C.
1701.922 (only a dozen years old, and which mirrors the <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
statute) are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extremely protective</i>,
and after giving a lot of protection in the statute, it states that it does not
limit or displace common law doctrines such as de facto, estoppel and so on.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Frontier Refining
Company v. Kunkel’s, Inc.</i> – This case arises in a state that had the old
Model Act formula, meaning your corporation is either formed or not with no
gray area. A promoter wanted to start a
gas station. Kunkel needed additional
money and he went to two prospective investors: <st1:City><st1:place>Fairfield</st1:place></st1:City>
and Beach. He asked them to invest in
the gas station. This case shows why
investors should get a letter from the corporate lawyer stating that the
corporation is validly and duly created under state law. The two guys wrote checks to the promoter,
who promised to form a corporation, but never did. The promoter goes to the owner of the service
station and enters into contracts under the name: “Kunkel d/b/a Kunkel’s, Inc.” However, he never went to the Secretary of
State and he never filed a charter!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The business went belly up! The seller of the gas station wasn’t paid! So the seller sues the promoter and the two
investors. The testimony at trial was
disputed. There are six different
theories the lawyer and client will usually put forward: (1) general
partnership, (2) agency, (3) joint enterprise, (4) statute, (5) third party
beneficiary, and (6) guaranty.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The joint enterprise theory, like agency, covers both
profit-making activities and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all other </i>activities
(i.e. not just business activities). There is some case law in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
suggesting that joint enterprise is alive and well! The joint enterprise theory is never applied
to the ordinary carpool to work.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If there is co-ownership of a business for profit, it fits
the general partnership statute, and you can reach all the partners
individually. Another category is the
third-party beneficiary. It may be that
contractual dealings between the capitalist and sweat equity have created a
third-party beneficiary. If they have, a
third-party beneficiary can sue in contract. The next-to-last theory you look at is guaranty. If Smith, Inc. goes under, but Mr. Smith, the
100% owner, has guaranteed the debts of the company, then you can sue Mr.
Smith. In some states, the statute of
frauds may be waived.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the present case, if you read the <st1:State><st1:place>Wyoming</st1:place></st1:State>
statute on defective formation carefully, it seems to say that people who act
like a corporation even though they’re not approved to be one will be jointly
and severally liable for the corporation’s debts and liabilities. Here, the two outside investors are a bit
difficult to put in the category of mere inactive investors. It’s not as though someone is going to his uncle
and is getting a $5,000 loan. It’s not
100% clear, but Shipman’s reading is that they disregard the statute and go to
the theory of estoppel because when the entrepreneur failed to make his monthly
payments on what he had borrowed, Frontier sued him in his individual
capacity. They sued Kunkel d/b/a Kunkel,
Inc. and got judgment against him in his individual capacity. The paperwork that he signed with Frontier
was all signed that way, and the court’s holding is based on estoppel. They simply hold that because the fellow was
dealt with as an individual, the Model Act provision that might have made the
investors jointly and severally liable was inapplicable.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let us tie up the loose ends of incorporating. What’s the rule about the number of
directors? The <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statutory scheme is common. The usual
rule is a minimum of three directors. However, if you have only one shareholder, you have only one directors,
and if you have only two shareholders then you can get by with only two
directors. Also, if § 1701.591 is
invoked, you could have a company with 20 shareholders and only one or two
directors. But there is no <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>upper limit </i>to the number of directors.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Is there a minimum number of shareholders? Up to 1950, there were court decisions that
followed the European practice that since the state statutes required a minimum
of three directors, you had to have a minimum of three shareholders. Statutes in the 1960’s reversed this, and in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
today, a single shareholder corporation is perfectly legal. The smaller the number of shareholders, the
more likely the corporate veil will get pierced.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>But</i>: (1) In many
countries, there must be a minimum of three shareholders. In those countries, if there is an American
parent that is the only shareholder, then you get two locals to buy one share
each, and they will known as accommodation shareholders. The parent will have the option to buy back
these shares. Watch foreign statutes
carefully! (2) Even in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and especially in civil law countries, there will be three or four different
classes of corporations. One of the four
will essentially be a hybrid between a corporation and a partnership. One of the hybrid features will be that the
shareholders have joint and several liabilities. So be careful! In this country, for professional
corporations in some states, they say that doctors may incorporate, but they
will have the same liabilities as a partnership. For example, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
PLC stands for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>public limited company</i>. This is the category for public companies
with limited liability.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Always end the name of the company with “(comma) Inc.” or
“(comma) Incorporated”. That is
recognized <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>throughout</i> the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and most of the rest of the world as
signifying a corporation with limited liability. Avoid using “<st1:place>Co.</st1:place>”! At common law, that denominated joint and
several liability on the part of shareholders. A few statutes in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
still say that, but you should make the name “(comma) Inc.” and worldwide
people will know what you’re talking about. Some state statutes authorize the use of “(comma) Ltd.” Don’t fool with it because it’s not exactly
clear. It could also mean “limited
partnership”. You have to hold yourself
out as a corporation in every way if you want to be treated like a corporation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The goal is to file the charter, filled out correctly. It’s called the articles of incorporation in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and the certificate of incorporation in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>. You fill out the form, take the filing fee,
and have it signed by one or more <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>competent
incorporator</i>. When you pay the fee,
the Secretary of State will timestamp your copy. What’s important? In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
fees are titled by statute. They’re in
Title I. The filing fees are usually not
tiny, but not high either. Look at the
schedule of fees to determine how many shares you want. Don’t form a corporation with 100 or 500
shares because they’re ultimately going to be spread around a family. If there are too few shares, you may have to
set up a trust to subdivide one share!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Par value: under our statute, you can use par or
no-par. But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>never use no-par</i>! Also,
never use high par except for preferred stock! How come? Many states, like <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
impose both a franchise tax and an income tax, and you pay the higher of the
two. The franchise tax is a percentage
applied against the assets of the company. If low par stock is used, and generally that will be either $0.01 or
$0.0001 per share, then they will use the par value to determine the tax. But if there is no par, they will use the
fair market value of the stock instead! Check if the state has a separate stock issuance or stock transfer
tax. <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
has neither, but nine states have such a tax. Sometimes that tax can be avoided by holding the closing of a
transaction in another state.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you go back 150 years, people usually set par value at
the initial offering, at what they thought the stock was actually worth. That has ceased to be true in this country,
though in some foreign countries it’s still somewhat true. Today, in this country, par value is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>partially artificial</i>, though
important. It’s important because the corporation
must receive at least par value for the issuance of stock <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>or</i> the purchaser will be subject to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>assessment</i> by statute and at common law for the difference. A sophisticated purchaser of stock will
always ask for the opinion of the legal counsel to the corporation that the
stock is duly and validly issued. Only
the board of directors can issue stock. The lawyer will also have to check that the charter authorizes enough shares
so that there are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unissued</i> shares
available to cover the issue. If that is
so, then it is not assessable, it is fully paid. If you use low par stock, like $0.01 or
$0.0001, then you probably won’t have a problem, and thus that’s what most
attorneys will advise. One reason you do
that is to minimize the exposure of directors and lawyers under creditors’
rights proceedings. High par can be used
to restrict the power of the board of directors, acting alone, without a
charter amendment, to pay dividends and/or buy stock back from selected
shareholders.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What is assessability all about? It goes to the heart of a corporation. The usefulness of a corporation is that you
can get inactive investors to buy stock and they have some assurance that if
the company goes bankrupt, their assets in their own possession are not going
to be liable for the deficit at the corporate level. Early in corporate history, up until 100
years ago, most corporate statutes made shareholders subject to assessment if
the corporation went bankrupt. As late
as 1960, if you filed in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
shareholders <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were </i>subject to
assessment, unless the articles of incorporation provided otherwise. But in the 1960’s, <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
met the mainstream of American law and said that in general, there is no
assessability. In the 1930’s, the
non-assessability general rule was fully adopted in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. It’s in the Ohio Constitution! It’s in Art. XIII, § 3. Are there still corporations around with
assessability features? Yes, there are:
in a few states, policyholders of mutual insurance companies are assessable by
the insurance commissioner if the insurance company goes bankrupt. But what’s the good news? If you have 20,000 policyholders, generally,
in those states, if it is an assessable mutual, then it is not joint and
several liability. Assessability will be
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>several only</i>, and in many states,
you, as one of 20,000 policyholders, if there is a shortfall in the company,
the insurance commissioner can assess you for only <st1:time Hour="13"
Minute="20">one twenty</st1:time>-thousandth of the deficit. There are limited partnerships and LLCs
around that have an assessability clause. Stay far away from them! Within
the past five years, one of the leading management consultant general
partnerships has an assessability clause that paid out very generously. Each partner got assessed $6,000!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There is a federal estate and gift tax. Some states have a gift tax too. If Mother is setting up a company and putting
$1 million in with 1000 authorized shares at $1 par per share, and she
immediately give 40% of the shares to her children as tenants in common, go see
the tax lawyer because there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gift</i>
there for federal and state purposes.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The state has records that you’ll be interested in from time
to time: The Secretary of State can give
you, for a fee, not only a certified copy of the articles of incorporation, you
can also get a certified copy of the docket sheet for the corporation running
back to formation. Plus, you can get
certified copies of everything that’s there. The Secretary of State, also for a fee, will give you a certificate of
good standing. What does this indicate? All state statutes provide that if you don’t
make the required filings annually with the Secretary of State and/or your
state tax returns, then they can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cancel</i>
your corporation. The certificate of
good standing says that a particular corporation is in good standing with the
state. If you’re going to make a big
deal, you always send someone to the Secretary of State’s office to get
that. Also, you will have to get an attorney’s
opinion that the corporation is duly and validly organized and existing as a
corporation under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> law. Therefore, the first thing you do is send
someone to the Secretary of State’s office to get all this stuff.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In many states, you can get a certificate of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tax </i>good standing from the tax
authorities. What’s the significance of
that? It’s limited, but useful,
according to Shipman. They will certify
that there are no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>assessed</i> taxes
unpaid. How does assessment take
place? Case law tells us that assessment
occurs in the office of the tax official when that official makes the
assessment by writing or typing in the office! It’s basically a claim by the tax commissioner that you owe money. Then the assessment is sent to you. This certificate will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i> deal with non-assessed tax claims. That is to say, all tax authorities will have
informal or formal audits ongoing, or they will be planning them before the
expiration of the statute of limitations. This certificate of tax good standing does not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>estop</i> them as to that. However, it’s still a worthwhile document to obtain. It’s a part of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>due diligence</i>. In many
states, a failure to file your tax return or pay your taxes on time can mean
the loss of your corporate charter.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>First off, there is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>de
jure</i> corporation. It has either been
perfectly formed, or close enough that not even the state in a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quo warranto</i> action can challenge.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>People v. Ford</i> –
This is an Illinois Supreme Court case from around 1921. The people were represented by the <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
Attorney General or Cook County Prosecutor. The corporate statute in <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
had a requirement that before articles be accepted for filing, they had to be
executed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>under seal</i>. The Secretary of State screwed up. Everyone filed on forms provided by him. They neglected to put the “L.S.” on there! This was a “friendly action” for a
declaration by the Illinois Supreme Court as to whether these were de jure
corporations. If you’re only de facto or
by estoppel, it doesn’t save you as against a suit by the sovereign. You must be de jure! The Illinois Supreme Court said that the
legislature did say this, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>but</i> the
requirement was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>merely directory</i>,
meaning, legally non-binding. Therefore,
the corporations were de jure corporations despite the screw-up.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What’s this merely directory business? Many state constitutions that didn’t give
their own constitutions a lot of effect, when the state Supreme Court was faced
with a strong directive in the constitution, they would say that the statement
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>merely directory</i>, meaning it’s a
directive by the people to the legislature. But there was no recourse if the legislature didn’t do what the
constitution said! If you’re in a state
with constitutional initiatives such as <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
<st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>, and <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
(along with eight other western states), then if you’re putting a provision in
a state constitution this way, you should add a last clause that says: “this
provision is not merely directory to the legislature. This provision is the law and private
citizens may sue on it and enforce it.”</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So up at the top is de jure. As of 1940, below de jure, the average state would say even if you
aren’t de jure, if you’re a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>de facto
corporation</i> or a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>corporation by
estoppel</i>, then private parties cannot argue that you’re not a valid
corporation even though the state may come in a say that you’re not de jure and
“cut your head off”. So in a case
involving contract creditors contracting with a corporation that hadn’t gotten
its certificate filed, if there’s no fraud by anybody, the contract is made in
the corporate name, there was no individual guarantee from the shareholder then
you have a corporation by estoppel, if not a de facto corporation. It takes a bit more to be a de facto
corporation rather than by estoppel. If
you’re de facto, it operates against tort <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
contract creditors, but if you’re by estoppel, it only applies to contract
creditors who made a deal with you in the corporate name.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>You know a document has been filed when you have a
time-stamped copy with the official seal on it that says it’s been filed. You don’t know before that whether the
document has been filed. Always print
and file a day or two early. Things can
get screwed up! Leave yourself time to
recover!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In 1946, the old MBCA, which Shipman said was a
“hare-brained” statute, said that you’re either a corporation or not, and
there’s no de facto or by estoppel defense. That’s the situation in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Robertson
v. Levy</i>. How far was the old MBCA
pushed? In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Sherwood</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Timberline</i>,
the courts had to follow what the statute said as to the people active in the
formation and running of the company. There’s no out! They were liable
just as general partners would be! Both
cases, however, used a lot of common sense. As to purely inactive investors, in good faith, the joint and several liability
would not apply. That is generally true
throughout the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. They will distinguish between those who are
active in the formation and running of a corporation and the mere investor, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>including</i>, often, the spouse, parent, or
child of the guy who is running the company. Shipman says that the courts are exactly right! The point of limited liability legislation is
to get inactive investors to invest in business enterprises, and in a
capitalist system, there are ups and downs. Maybe inactive investors are willing to risk $10,000 or $20,000, but not
their home and everything else. That’s
what makes the system work!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let’s suppose the defectively organized company itself is
suing and the articles haven’t been filed. <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State> adopted a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>common name statute </i>in the 1870’s. It spread throughout most of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
has a common name statute. This statute
says if you’re suing an organization in its common name simply for the recovery
of the assets that the company has, the fact that it’s not incorporated or
defectively incorporated is no defense. On the other hand, an unincorporated association or defective
incorporated association suing someone else in contract or tort can do so in
the common name. These are widespread
statutes, but there are five or six states that don’t have them. In a state that doesn’t have such a statute
and you’re suing a law firm, you need to make copies of the complaint for all
the partners. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
if you sue a law firm for $10,000, you simply lay one copy of the complaint on
the managing partner. Consequently, if
that law firm is suing someone, you’ll need a signature for the firm plus a
signature for every partner. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
however, the law firm could sue under its own name under the common name statute.</p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297527"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Ultra vires – R.C. 1701.13</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This means <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>beyond the
powers</i>. Here in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
in the 1970’s, we were one of the last states to allow that corporations can be
formed “for any lawful purpose” and may say so in the charter. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
today, everyone says “any lawful purpose”. “Any lawful purpose” doesn’t include insurance or banking!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In § 1701.13, we’re given a helpful enumeration of
powers. Why did they do that? In the 1920’s, when you had to enumerate your
purpose, the charters would enumerate five or six purposes and then would
enumerate about 20 powers and then they would say: “the purposes are powers and
the powers are purposes!” They were
trying to get back at the legislatures for not allowing the phrase “for any
lawful purposes!” The federal and state
governments decided early on that in limiting the powers of corporations they
would rely more on antitrust, tax, labor, and environmental laws than they
would on provisions in the charter. That’s very different from the practice as of 1800! Ultra vires remains important!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What was the law as of 1940, and how did it get up to that
point? If a contract was fully performed
on both sides, there is limited ultra vires relief; almost none. The exception was corporate directors or
officers engaging in ultra vires acts, which creates a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>mild</i> presumption of negligence. In theory, the state can come in and by action of quo warranto cut your
head off for an ultra vires action.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Litwin v. Allen</i> –
What if the bank were a state bank under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law? In this action for money damages,
the plaintiff would have to plead and prove recklessness. It’s an action by or on behalf of the
corporation. That comes from R.C.
1701.59(D), which is about 50 years old. But that’s not the end of the story! Look at the “banking trauma” of the 80’s, when many banks and S &amp; Ls
went out of business. The federal
government had to spent billions cleaning it up. It cost a total of around $600 billion to taxpayers. The federal banking authorities have federal
legislation saying that as to banks, a provision like R.C. 1701.59(D) can push
the level down to gross negligence, but it can’t push it down to
recklessness. In this case, what the
officers and directors did was ultra vires because the charter forbade the loan
and transaction made. They didn’t run it
by a lawyer! The lawyer would have
caught it.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If a contract is executory on both sides, then any
shareholder of the company can sue the company and the other party and get an
injunction to stop it. R.C. 1701.13, at
the end, adopts that rule with this caveat: if the contract is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>partially</i> performed on one side or the
other or if an injunction would be inequitable, then there is no relief. R.C. 1701.13 provides relief in this
area. The casebook talks about a <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> case, which indicates that the courts <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i> go beyond the legislation in giving
relief.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Jacksonville</i></st1:place></st1:City><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Railroad</i> – This came up in diversity
litigation in the 1870’s under federal common law (pre-<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Erie</i>). A railroad’s charter
said that its purpose was to run a railroad between <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> and <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>. The railroad built a hotel at the end of the
line in <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>. There is an action by a shareholder for
damages or to stop the hotel. The U.S.
Supreme Court holds, in language reminiscent of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>McCullough v. Maryland</i>, they say “let the end be legitimate and
proper and then all reasonable and necessary means to accomplish that end will
be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied</i>.”</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Say there’s an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation formed in 1921 in <st1:City><st1:place>Cleveland</st1:place></st1:City>
“to engage in manufacturing”. They’ve
never amended their charter. The corporation
is closely held. The executive vice
president goes to the board of directors with two proposals: (1) buy 100,000
shares of common stock of a publicly traded natural gas company listed on the
NYSE, and (2) buy 100% of the capital stock of X Inc., a closely-held
Ohio-chartered natural gas company in <st1:City><st1:place>Cleveland</st1:place></st1:City>
operating natural gas wells. How do we
advise the board of directors as the counsel for the company as to the possible
ultra vires problems? How might they be
dealt with? Assume you’re at a law firm
and a senior partner asks this question. Then he asks: what practical problems of a professional responsibility
nature is our law firm going to run into on this transaction in (1) advising
the board and the officers and (2) giving legal opinions to the people on the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other side</i> of these transactions? Factor in R.C. 1701.59 and
1701.13(E)(5)(a). Look at R.C.
1701.69-.72 to see how the charter might be amended.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Ultra vires and “no authority of agent” are two different
defenses. Let us see why. Ultra vires means that the corporation <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>itself</i>, acting through all of its organs
(officers, directors, and shareholders) simply does not have the power. On the other hand, when you say that the
agent did not have actual or apparent authority, it’s entirely separate. The corporation is saying that the action is
something that the directors and/or shareholders should have approved. This is quite separate, though related to
ultra vires at times.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Suppose a particular corporate action is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>illegal</i>. Shipman believes that it is a separate defense from the other two,
though it is very closely related. If
you’re trying to enjoin an action as a shareholder, and the directors have
violated a statute, you will usually add <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>illegality</i>
as a count of your suit. The question will
be: does the statute, as interpreted by the court, give <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>standing</i> to a shareholder to raise the illegality issue? It depends! This question usually comes up under the rubric of “implied private
right of action”. We use torts
lingo. Note that illegality includes
criminality but is broader than criminality. If certain conduct violates a criminal statute, the conduct will be both
criminal and illegal. But if it only
violates a civil statute, the conduct will not be criminal but will still be
illegal.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Note that sometimes this is part of contracts lingo, though
under a different name. If a contract is
void as against public policy, either party may get a judicial determination
stopping the prospective performance of that contract. This is similar but different from the
“implied private right of action”. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
under the securities statute, R.C. Chapter 1707, there are three or four
express private rights of action, R.C.
1707.38-.45. But in those sections, it
explicitly says that the courts will not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>imply</i>
private rights of action beyond what we the legislature have expressly
stated. However, despite that language,
the Ohio Supreme Court has held that if you have a contract to be performed in
the future and that contract is in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>material
</i>violation of R.C. Chapter 1707, either party can come into court and get a
declaratory judgment saying that the contract <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>shall not be performed</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>The hypothetical from
Thursday</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>X, Inc., a closely-held <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation formed in 1921 to do manufacturing, states the purpose in its
charter to manufacture industrial goods. It has never amended its charter to broaden that purpose. Two items come before the board of
directors. I’m the outside legal counsel
for X, Inc., and the board of directors and officers want my opinion on both
items. First, one of the officers thinks
that investing $500,000 in the capital stock of a big NYSE natural gas company
would be a good investment. The
directors ask me whether this would be ultra vires. In R.C. 1701.13, a lot of powers are given to
the corporation and they don’t need to be copied into the charter to be
valid. Generally speaking, according to
the statute, ultra vires cannot be raised as a defense by the corporation
itself, but that the provision does not limit quo warranto actions by the
state. The provision also doesn’t limit
officers’ and directors’ liability. Finally, non-complicit minority shareholders of the company can bring
injunctive actions to prevent ultra vires contracts from being performed so
long as the judgment setting aside the contract is not grossly unfair to the
other party to the contract.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But that’s not all! Lawyers are always looking to protect themselves. “It’s a jungle out there!” Lawyers have malpractice liability to worry
about. We may be asked to render an
opinion that a contract has been duly and validly adopted and is enforceable in
a court by its terms. We may have to
render an opinion to our company and also to a third party.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Assuming that the company is solvent and has the money to
invest and assuming that the board and officers have done their research in
investing in the NYSE, one of the express statements of R.C. 1701.13 is that
for companies like X, investing as a pure investor without control in a company
doing something different from what your company does is not subject to an
ultra vires objection.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let’s assume that the company is financially solvent. One of the officers wants X to purchase 100%
of the capital stock of Z, Inc., a closely held <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation producing natural gas in <st1:place>Northeast Ohio</st1:place>,
where X has its plants. If X had been
formed in 1980 and the lawyer had put in “any lawful business” as the purpose,
there would be no problem. We would
simply make sure they had done their due diligence on Z, and that they have the
money to do it. But this is a
1921-formed corporation with a specific purpose: to manufacture industrial
goods. R.C. 1701.13 says: if you’re
buying control of another company and that company is not within your purposes,
then it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> be ultra vires! Why do we say “can” instead of “will”? It <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>probably</i>
would be ultra vires, but there’s the possibility that it won’t be, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i> Z’s natural gas wells are very close
to X’s plants and X would plan to use the natural gas produced by Z to run
their manufacturing plants. Then it
would be the same situation as <st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
  normal'>Jacksonville</i></st1:place></st1:City> (see <st1:City><st1:place>Hamilton</st1:place></st1:City>,
notes, p. 277).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But let’s say X is getting their natural gas from a utility
and they’re happy with it. We would tell
X to look at R.C. 1701.69-.72 and propose an amendment to the articles of
incorporation to allow the corporation to run for “any lawful purpose”. That will probably give rise to appraisal
rights to shareholders voting against the amendments. There will probably be no problem if X is
closely held.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>One more point on ultra vires: if all shareholders, voting
and non-voting, approve after full and fair disclosure in advance and if
creditors are not hurt by the ultra vires action, then the ultra vires cause of
action disappears insofar as shareholders are concerned. There are two people who can come after you:
the state can come after you in a quo warranto action. Also, if what you’re proposing may violate
agreements with creditors and the creditors don’t assent, then the creditors
can shut down the transaction. As
important as the articles are, the credit instruments of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>any</i> corporation (from Exxon down to Mom ‘n’ Pop, Inc.) are just as
important, if not more. In real life,
you’ll find yourself negotiating with creditors for waivers, you’ll read these
credit instruments to find out what is proscribed and what is allowed, and some
of the credit instruments get very long and detailed.</p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc76297528"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Disregard of the corporate fiction</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>One thing you have to often write an opinion about is
whether stock has been duly and validly issued and non-assessable. Another opinion that must sometimes be given
is on whether the corporation is duly organized and existing as a corporation
under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> law. Clients will press lawyers for a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>third </i>opinion: that they, as
shareholders, will not be personally liable for the debts, liabilities and
obligations of the corporation. Attorneys will not touch that opinion “with a 50-foot pole”! There are six or seven theories out there for
disregard of the corporate fiction. You
can discuss with a client the things they can do to minimize the problem, but
the legal opinion is that you simply cannot and should not give that opinion.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>However, it is an uphill battle for people asserting
disregard of the corporate fiction because legislatures have purposefully set
up corporate statutes and other statutes to encourage investment by inactive
investors. The very first thing that an
inactive investor wants is assurance that you can only lose what you put into a
stock and no more. For example, consider
the case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Abbott v. Post</i> from
1940. This case involved the pre-1933
National Bank Act dealing with insolvency of national banks. Before 1933, national banks had to issue $100
par common stock. That means the shareholders
had to pay at least $100 per share of stock to the company when it was
issued. The act also provided that if
the bank went insolvent, each shareholder could be assessed up to par.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What was done in 1933 to encourage investment in banks? They prospectively did away with the
assessment of stock. Also, both the <st1:City><st1:place>Hoover</st1:place></st1:City>
and <st1:place>Roosevelt</st1:place> administrations set up the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation, whose job was to pull banks out of bankruptcy. It was run for many years by Jesse Jones, a
very wealthy businessman from <st1:City><st1:place>Houston</st1:place></st1:City>. The banks all went to Jones wanting loans
from the RFC. He checked their balance
sheet and told them that they couldn’t afford to make the interest payments. Instead, he caused the RFC to buy <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>preferred stock</i> of the banks, and as the
banks recovered, the RFC redeemed the stock and over the years managed to break
even.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This case involves a big investor in a national bank who
went to a lawyer before he invested. The
lawyer told him about the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>double
liability provision</i>. So this investor
formed a personal holding corporation, put money into the corporation, and then
the corporation bought the stock in the national bank. The investor was the only shareholder of the
corporation. During the Depression, that
national bank went belly up! The U.S.
Supreme Court held that there was a strong pubic policy involved and the sole
shareholder of the personal holding company <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could
</i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>would </i>be reached. This had no application post-1933 because to
sell stock of national banks, Congress prospectively did away with the rule.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What’s the importance in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>? During the Great Depression, Article XIII § 3
of the Ohio Constitution was adopted, which generally forbids assessability of
stock. That’s where you start <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
research about disregard of the corporate fiction.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bartle v. Home Owners
Coop.</i> – The parent is a non-profit corporation composed of World War II
veterans seeking inexpensive housing. The not-for-profit cooperative formed a 100% owned stock subsidiary
which constructed houses and sold them without profit to the veterans who were
members of the parent cooperative. There
is no fraud or “sham” alleged (those are two of the seven possibilities for
piercing the corporate veil). A “sham”
is more of a legal conclusion than an aid to analysis, while fraud has some
legal substance to it. But neither one
was alleged. What was alleged was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>undercapitalization</i> of the stock
subsidiary. The contract creditors of
the subsidiary, which went insolvent, wanted to reach the assets of the
not-for-profit parent on the ground that the subsidiary was
undercapitalized. They also alleged and
pretty much proved that the subsidiary could never make a profit because the
deal, from day one, was to make inexpensive houses sold without a markup to
impecunious veterans who are members of the parent corporation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When you have undercapitalization and no profit alleged in a
contracts case <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> law says
that if there’s no fraud or sham, then it means that the financial statements
of the company were reasonably accurate and therefore anyone doing the business
of the subsidiary could have gotten signed, written guarantees from the parent
which would have been fully enforceable. However, they didn’t do so. To
look ahead to the next case, the court also finds that there is no
estoppel. That’s the majority argument,
and that’s still the rule in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>. But in different jurisdictions it’s
different.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Consider the dissent in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bartle</i>. The dissent makes arguments similar to two
tax problems that this setup would have. From a tax standpoint, the commissioner of internal revenue could attack
it in two ways: first, they could use § 482, where you have two or more persons
or entities under common control or where one controls the other. The commissioner may reallocate items of
income, expense, and deductions so as to fairly reflect income. The Internal Revenue Service could have come
in here and said that the houses were worth $8,000 but were being sold for
$6,000. It could have allocated $2,000
as dividends to the member of the cooperative parent saying that the difference
is an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied dividend</i>. The dissent argues that this same line of
reasoning should apply on the disregard of the corporate fiction theory. The majority hears the argument but doesn’t
find it persuasive. There are real tax
problems here!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dewitt Truck Brokers
v. W. Ray Flemming Fruit Co. </i>– Flemming’s company worked as a middleman
between farmers and purchasers of fruit. Flemming paid the plaintiff trucking company to transport fruit. Flemming assured the trucking company that he
would guarantee to pay them back even if his corporation didn’t. Flemming didn’t pay them in time, and the
trucking company sued Flemming personally. Flemming tried to argue that he wasn’t personally liable, but instead
only the corporation was liable. The
trucking company, on the other hand, argued that they should be able to “pierce
the corporate veil” so they could make Flemming personally liable. The district court found for the plaintiffs
and Flemming appealed.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>Did the district court correctly find
that it was appropriate to “pierce the corporate veil” and make Flemming liable
for the debts of his corporation? When a
person owns basically all the stock in a corporation, plus some other factors
are present such as a lack of corporate formalities, undercapitalization and
non-payment of dividends, or if the corporation is more or less a façade for an
individual, the corporation may be disregarded for the purposes of liability
and the dominant stockholder may be held liable. Flemming owned most of the stock. He never had a shareholder meeting, and he
was the only real director. No one
except Flemming ever got paid by the corporation. Flemming kept withdrawing whatever money the
corporation had for his personal use. The corporation basically had no capital of its own. Given all this, plus Flemming’s personal
assurance to the plaintiff creditor, the appellate court has no problem
upholding the district court’s findings of fact. Flemming is held personally liable for the
debt.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This is a contract case. It’s easier to pierce the corporate veil in torts cases than in
contracts cases because a contract creditor could always, in theory, insist
upon a guarantee by the controlling person or persons. In this case, too, there is no fraud or sham
alleged. It’s clearly another
undercapitalized corporation. It’s also
pretty much like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bartle</i> in that this
corporation could never profit. In both
cases, the corporation is always operating <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on
the edge</i>, and when a bad development came along, they went “over the abyss”
into “financial hell”, or in other words, they went insolvent. Remember that if you can prove fraud or a
sham, you can definitely pierce the veil. Here, there was no express <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>written</i>
guarantee by the controlling shareholder, but there’s the “next best thing”: an
oral guarantee! Here we have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>soft estoppel</i>. There is not necessarily <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>detrimental reliance</i>. What
happened here was that one of the unpaid creditors went up to the trucker and
said: “Hey! You’re way behind on your
payments!” The trucker said: “If the
company doesn’t pay, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I </i>will.” This is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Cockerham</i> case again! Somebody’s trying to be too (financially) macho! But that’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>soft estoppel</i>, not estoppel per § 186 of Restatement First of
Contracts.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>DeWitt</i>, the
defendant brings up the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds says that a promise to answer for the debts of
another must be in a signed writing. The
defendant says that this is just crap! It’s not in writing and it’s not signed. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>But</i>, in the last 100 years,
the statute of frauds has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>softened</i> a
good bit, though not totally. For
example, if you write out a check with a notation of what property it’s for and
what the purchase price is and you hand it to the other guy, even if he doesn’t
cash it, it’s held to be a signed memorandum. It describes the land and the price, so it’s found to satisfy the
statute of frauds. Also, there is the
doctrine of part performance, which can get you out from under the statute of
frauds. When a major or 100% shareholder
of a corporation makes a statement such as: “I will stand by my
corporation!” The court says that he’s
not answering for the debts of another, but rather he’s answering for his own
debts. Post-1980, we have an Ohio Court
of Appeals case stating exactly that.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Next time we’ll go over extraordinary transactions:
amendment of articles, sale of all assets, dissolution, statutory merger, and
control share acquisitions. All the
directors and shareholders typically must approve of such transactions, and
dissenting shareholders typically get appraisal rights so they can cash in
their shares. This goes beyond so-called
“reorganizations”, which come in two flavors: (1) recapitalization, and (2)
amalgamations, or putting two or more companies together in one of several
ways. In Wall Street firms, you never
get a department labeled “amalgamations”; it’s always called “mergers and
acquisitions”. Dissolution of the
company is a big event!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>All of these corporations are either corporations de jure or
de facto. In other words, the plaintiff
is not relying on some defect in formation, but instead is going to this
question: assuming there is enough compliance to be de facto or de jure, can
third parties nonetheless look through the corporate veil and hold the active
shareholders, officers, and directors liable? There are seven different ways to do this. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Public
policy </i>is what comes up in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Abbott</i>. Fraud will always appear, though it’s

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Baatz v. Arrow Bar </i>–
This takes place in a <st1:City><st1:place>Fargo</st1:place></st1:City>
bar. Bar owners got a statute passed
saying that in <st1:State><st1:place>South Dakota</st1:place></st1:State>,
there will be no dram shop liability. Most states have dram shop liability, meaning that if you serve
excessive liquor to X, and X goes out and negligently kills Z, then Z’s
survivors can bring suit against the bar. Based on this legislative victory for the bar owners, the Arrow Bar
decided to drop its liability insurance. So their bartender serves too many drinks to X and X runs out and
negligently kills Z, and Z’s survivors bring a wrongful death action. They sue the bartender. They try to sue the owners too. If they had been tending the bar themselves,
then they could have been sued as primary actors.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The primary actor doctrine says that even though the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i> may be liable under respondeat
superior, you can also sue the actor. There are three exceptions of recent vintage, however: (1) Under the
Federal Tort Claims Act, if a United States government employee is merely
negligent, your only suit is against the federal government itself, and the
federal government cannot recover from the actor because the FTCA didn’t
include statutory provisions to that effect. (2) In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> and many other
state tort claims acts, if a state or local employee is merely negligent, you
can only sue the employer and you can’t join the employee, except if the
employee has acted recklessly or worse, in which case you can sue both the
employer and employee. (3) Under federal
equal employment law, if an executive sexually harasses someone, you can’t sue
that executive; you can only sue the private employer. This doesn’t seem to make sense! But this doctrine has been rejected through
the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> equal employment
statute. This means that many
plaintiffs’ attorneys send to sue using the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statute rather than the federal statute.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So we can sue the corporation under respondeat
superior. But the problem is that the
corporation has a lot of debt to the bank and not much in the way of net assets
once you consider its debts. The bank
has a lot of perfected first mortgages on the borrower’s property, because the
bank stays in business by taking mortgages on everything. Why would the bank loan to the company when
it didn’t have much capital? The
shareholders were forced by the bank to sign written guarantees before the bank
lent to the corporation. That’s a fact
of life! Until a corporation becomes
fairly prosperous with a lot of assets of its own, banks won’t make loans to it
unless they get a guarantee from the shareholders.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>Undercapitalization
as a way to pierce the veil</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This is fairly pro-plaintiff in theory. The black letter rule is that
undercapitalization is a key factor, but as to common torts, if the corporation
has been covered with reasonable amounts of insurance, that will be considered
adequate capitalization. There was no
insurance policy here! They relied on
the state statute! What’s wrong with
that? The South Dakota Supreme Court
declared the statute unconstitutional! The plaintiff argued that even though the company had some money, the
fact that the shareholders had guaranteed the bank loan was enough to show
undercapitalization.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In many states, if you have some kind of immunity and you
nonetheless get insurance, then that will be deemed a waiver of immunity with
one exception: if the insurance policy itself has a clause saying “the writing
of the insurance by the insurance company and the getting of the insurance by
the insured are not considered to be a waiver of any immunity or
privilege”. If you work for an insurance
company, you want to put that clause in all your policies because it will
generally be honored. This is also
becoming an issue for not-for-profit organizations. The cost of directors’ and officers’
insurance has gone way up! The premiums
have probably doubled in the last five years! Non-profits have convinced their directors (or trustees) that there is
nothing wrong with that. It’s true that
it’s less of a problem than with a non-profit, but it’s still a problem.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Radaszewski v. Telecom
Corp.</i> – A parent owns 100% of a subsidiary in the “gear-crunching”
business. The subsidiary went to an
insurance company and got a good policy. The subsidiary had a very negligent driver. The other driver was not negligent. The injured people can sue the trucking
companies. But people who finance big
trucking companies take out mortgages on the “big rigs”. So the injured party wants to pierce the
corporate veil up to the wealthy parent corporation. There is no fraud, no soft estoppel, no mere
sham, so we get to the question: if a parent owns 100% of a subsidiary is there
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se</i> agency or partnership? But there is no per se! The very purpose of corporate law is to allow
a parent to set up a 100% subsidiary. If
they operate it right, the mere fact that you own it 100% doesn’t mean that the
subsidiary is your agent or partner. If
you don’t rule this way, you undercut the very basis of corporate law!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The plaintiffs tried to argue undercapitalization, but the
rejoinder was that the subsidiary <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>had an
insurance policy</i>. But the answer to
the rejoinder was that the insurance company went bankrupt! The court holds that there was no evidence
that the subsidiary knew the insurance company was on shaky ground. They made reasonable efforts to get
reasonable insurance, and having proved that they’re safe.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Seminole Hot
Springs</i>, a lawyer created a corporation to start a swimming pool. A kid drowned due to the negligence of the
pool’s employees. The plaintiff sued to
pierce the corporate veil and named the company <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and</i> its major shareholders as defendants. The California Supreme Court held the
piercing of the corporate veil quite proper against the shareholders.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Next, the plaintiff wanted to nail the lawyer for the
company because he had acted as an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>accommodation
director and officer</i> because <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
law at the time required three directors. The client begged him to do it, and he consented. “The road to hell is paved with good
intentions!” When the lawyer acts as an
accommodation director or officer, he can be reached. The lawyer’s malpractice policy will usually
exclude the lawyer acting as an officer, director, guardian or
administrator. Plus, all insurance
policies require a separate ERISA and environmental insurance policy. However, this court remanded for a new trial
against the lawyer because he was not named as a part in the original
suit. The California Supreme Court held
that since he was not a party in the original suit, the findings against him
were not res judicata or collateral estoppel. If you’re a plaintiff suing to pierce the corporate veil, you must name
as additional parties to your suit everyone who you want to “reach out and
touch” financially.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court took the same view. There was a suit against the corporation
(only) and there was judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff wanted the judgment executed
against the shareholders on the grounds of piercing of the corporate veil. The Court held that there was no way! If you want your judgment to apply to
piercing parties as well as the company itself, you must name those parties in
the original suit and serve them. This
is one of the first things that the plaintiff must think about.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Good plaintiffs’ medical malpractice lawyers, when suing a
doctor, never name the nurses, secretaries or aides as defendants. The big reason that they’re not named is that
their testimony won’t be helpful to you if you’re suing them.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In a community property state, if H is the major shareholder
and the stock is in his name, but it’s community property, to bind the whole
community, you must name W as well as H because the community property under
her name is not bound to the suit unless you name her! W may have more money than H if she saved her
earnings! The contract rule on joint
liability is that you must sue <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i>
jointly liable persons. However, with
joint and several liability, you can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pick</i>
and sue wealthy people first. If you win
and think you can pick up more money against the others, then you can go and do
it! In contract, however, that’s not so! So in a community property state, if you’re
piercing against one spouse, to bind the whole community you’ll have to name
the other spouse and bind him or her.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>An issue in all community property states is whether the
contract or tort was for the community or separate property. Check out the Nutshell to start your
research. Keep in mind that in a common
law state, you will not be able to reach the marital property of the other
spouse if that spouse was not on the corporate board and stayed out of the spouse’s
business.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Fletcher v. Atex, Inc.</i>
– Maybe courts will toss these terms around as conclusions: “mere agency”,
“mere instrumentality” and “no separate personality”. When you have a parent and subsidiary, you
will have lots of overlap of the officers and directors. You will also have, in a well-run
corporation, good coordination of management and cash flow. Those management tools virtually give a
license for disregard of the corporate entity, according to the plaintiff, but
the court says no.</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Bestfoods</i> – This gets us into
federal-state relations and especially environment statutes. The Sixth Circuit construed the Superfund
statute, which deals with hazardous sites where people have dumped chemicals
into the ground over the years. The
federal government surveys these sites and presumably will clean them up
eventually. They designate them, and
once they clean them up, they send the bill to “the owner” or “the operator”
according to the statute. If you buy
land, you work with an environmental attorney in advance. They will have aerial surveys. You will also look at local newspapers. If you’re a good faith purchaser for
consideration and didn’t know, and a reasonable person <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>would not have known</i> of the problem, you can’t get stuck with the
bill.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit said that disregard in the environmental
area would be narrow, would require <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>great</i>
proof and that state law disregard could be “disregarding”. Souter, writing for the Court, says that the
federal government and state agencies can rely <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>either</i> on the statute or on general disregard law under state
law. He gets into some more technical
points. Does the plaintiff make out his
case merely by showing that most of the officers and directors of the
subsidiary are also officers and directors of the parent? Not necessarily. It’s not dispositive.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Fleet Factors</i>
out of the Eleventh Circuit, it was a Superfund case and the company couldn’t
pay. Fleet Factors, however, was wealthy
so the government went after them on the basis of a loan agreement between them
and the little company. The government
claims that the loan agreement was so broad as to make Fleet Factors either an
owner or an operator for the purposes of the statute. There was a big cry in Corporate America, and
the EPA issued a regulation purported to overturn the case! But that’s not all! The D.C. Circuit held the regulation
invalid! If you work in environmental
law, this case casts a long shadow. So
work with an environmental lawyer early!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you’re a parent, do your due diligence! There’s also a Fifth Circuit case in which a
company bought most of the stock of a subsidiary and left most of its directors
there, but then added one of their own directors and a couple officers. The Fifth Circuit held that the fact that
they left most of the old board there was heavy evidence against disregard of
the corporate entity.</p>

district court disallowed Litton’s claim, but the Court of Appeals reversed,
saying that the previous judgment was res judicata. Did the bankruptcy court have the power to
disallow Litton’s judgment against the company of which he was the sole
shareholder? Bankruptcy courts sit in
equity and can set aside deals that don’t have the hallmarks of an “arms-length
bargain”. Basically, the Court says that
you can’t hide behind a one-man corporation to avoid being liable to creditors.

<p><b>Sale of assets,
statutory merger, and control share acquisition</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>R.C. 1701.73-.76 says that if you’re going to have a sale of
substantially all assets, the directors must propose and the shareholders must
approve. With a public company, the
proxy statement will also be subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. R.C. 1701.86-.91 say that if the shareholders
vote to dissolve the company, that gives the directors the power to sell the
assets. What’s the difference? R.C. 1701.73-.76 deals with the situation
where the company will sell all its present assets, take the money, and start a
new business. If you’re going to do
this, you must give the dissenting shareholders a cash appraisal. If, on the other hand, the board of directors
is empowered to sell the assets in dissolution pursuant to R.C. 1701.86-.91, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>there is no appraisal right</i>. What does this mean for a lawyer? It means that if you’re going to dissolve,
adopt only the resolution under R.C. 1701.86-.91 and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>do not</i>, on top of that, adopt a sale of assets resolution, because
if you do the latter under R.C. 1701.73-.76, the dissenting shareholders will
get appraisal rights. Under 1701.95, if
the directors don’t do that, they are individually personally liable jointly
and severally. That tends to get your
attention! Therefore, if it’s a
manufacturing company and there is a R.C. 1701.86-.91 resolution and they sell
their assets to GM, they will realize that there may be products liability in
the future. What do they do? They go to an insurance broker and buy tail
coverage from a solvent insurer. It’s
the same kind of coverage a doctor or lawyer buys when they retire. It costs a premium on top of what normal
yearly coverage starts. You don’t want
to move to <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State> and then have
your home taken from you. And it lasts
forever!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In 1830, the rule was (and it is today) that as to any
association (business or not-for-profit) there could be no dissolution, charter
amendment, merger, or sale of all assets unless you met one of three
conditions:</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li style='mso-list:l7 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>All

 <li style='mso-list:l7 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>A
     statute authorizes such action on a lesser vote.</li>
</ol>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the corporate world, starting after the Civil War,
legislatures modernized the statutes in all four areas. They provided a scheme (similar to what we
see in R.C. 1701.69-91) that upon the appropriate stated shareholder vote there
could be a dissolution, charter amendment, amalgamation (statutory merger), or
a sale of all assets. These changes were
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sweeping</i>, and it set the base for the
growth of the modern <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big</i>
corporation. If you look at nearly any
corporation’s history, you’ll find many mergers, etc. involved. It’s a quite Darwinian process: corporation
adapt to changing conditions (“the one part of Darwinism that is least
controversial”). In order to make these
changes palatable to shareholders, the legislatures provided that many of these
votes, if passed, would constitute such a change in the original business deal
that it would be only fair to give <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dissenting
shareholders, voting “no”, a cash appraisal remedy</i>. Legislatures have made the business corporation
and the not-for-profit corporation very flexible and adaptable by having the
foresight to allow these actions. But
with partnerships and LLCs, much of this flexibility is missing.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In most states, all of these extraordinary transactions
require <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> the board of directors
to vote “yes”, and the shareholders to vote “yes”. <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
is a little different. On dissolution
and charter amendments, the shareholders acting alone are authorized to do
it. That’s not true for merger or sale
of all assets. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Shipman proposes that
this is because <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> is a quite

example, term limits arrived in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
by way of a constitutional initiative. Also, in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, only
shareholders can adopt most regulations, and the shareholders may amend the
regulations <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>acting alone</i>, which is
very rare among state statutes (but correct, in Shipman’s opinion).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Last time, we talked about dissolution and talked about how
complicated it is. The directors must
pay or make adequate provision for payment of all liabilities before
distributing assets to shareholders. R.C. 1701.95 gives this teeth! If
the directors fail to do this, they will be individually jointly and severally
liable! (“How do you like them apples?”)</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Now we’re talking about the purchaser of a corporation for
cash, but I’m not sure what’s happening. One company buys another. To what
extent does the purchasing company assume the contract and tort liabilities of
the target corporation? The purchase
will be taxable to the selling corporation itself. Then when it dissolves and turns over the
cash in excess of liabilities, what the shareholders receive will again be
subject to tax. It’s a double tax! <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But if the selling corporation is Sub S, then
the double tax will shrink to a single tax because there will be no tax at the
corporate level. But it’s still a big

<p>The <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has had a corporate income tax since 1913. Almost from the beginning, there have been certain provisions related to
tax-free transactions: Internal Revenue Code § 351 (dealing with formation of a
corporation) and § 368. The tax burden
on this cash transaction would be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>monumental</i>
(in some cases). § 368 provides two or
three ways to do this tax-free, both to the selling corporation and to its
shareholders. One of the requirements is
that the sole consideration be stock (in some cases, voting stock) of the
acquiring corporation. In the
transaction described above, under § 368 (a)(1)(C), if the sole consideration
is voting stock of the acquiring corporation, this can be done <i

<p>This is an alternative to one company buying another. What’s a statutory merger? Consider the traditional Christian conception
of marriage: “the two become one”. There
is a formal merger agreement approved by the board of directors of both
companies, the shareholders of the acquired corporation, and, in most cases,
the shareholders of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>acquiring</i>
corporation. The agreement says that the
two corporations will become <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one</i>. That’s the “poetry”, but let’s consider the
“prose”. The statute says that all debts,
obligations, and liabilities of the acquired corporation, “by operation of law”
become debts, obligations, and liabilities of the acquiring corporation. This applies to liabilities, whether known or
unknown, whether contingent or not contingent, and whether contested or not
contested. A big Ohio Supreme Court case
of the 1990s applied this language quite literally to a stock redemption
agreement of the acquired corporation. The question was: after the merger, could this be enforced against the
acquiring corporation? Yes!</p>

Statutory mergers are inherently dangerous on the liability side! It’s very Draconian. Careful lawyers had developed the habit by
the 1950’s, especially in tax-free transactions, of going on the asset
purchase. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Ferris v. Glen Alden</i>, decided by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in
the 1950’s, involved an amalgamation of two big NYSE companies. The consideration was voting stock of the
acquiring corporation. The <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>
statute authorized the sale of all assets and statutory merger in a separate
statute. They chose to go with the sale
of all assets. A shareholders’ suit was
brought before the meeting on ultra vires grounds: this was a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>de facto merger</i> in that the whole business
of the acquired corporation was being taken over, stock was being issued, and
there was a contractual assumption of all known, uncontested liabilities. The paperwork that had to be submitted to
shareholders differed in the two transactions. In addition, if it were a mere sale of assets, there would be no
shareholder appraisal right.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed with the plaintiff
shareholders and said this really was a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>de
facto merger</i>! They told the two
companies to go back to the drawing board to comply with the notice requirement
and give appraisal rights.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Subsequent cases in other jurisdictions expanded the de
facto merger doctrine to liabilities, saying: when you buy the whole business
for your own stock and contractually assume the known, uncontested liabilities,
it is also a de facto merger for liability purposes. That is to say, you take over all of the
liabilities of the acquired corporation, even those that were unknown,
undisclosed, contingent, and/or contested! “Hey, baby! You’re getting what
might be a Trojan Horse!”</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State> has
flatly rejected <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Farris v. Glen Alden</i>. Two or three Ohio Supreme Court cases in the
last twenty years have said, in essence, that in the absence of fraud or a mere
change in form of a single corporation, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ferris
v. Glen Alden</i> will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not be followed </i>in
Ohio. But that’s not the end of the
story.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ray v. Alad</i> – This
case is out of <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>’s
appellate court. A manufacturing
corporation sold all of its assets to a bigger corporation for cash and went
out of business. The acquiring company
continued the product line. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>After </i>the amalgamation, a machine
manufactured by the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>selling</i>
corporation exploded and there was product liability. The plaintiff could, of course, go after the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>old</i> company that sold, and under the
Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act could go after the shareholders. But that’s messy. The contractual assumption of liabilities was
narrow and clearly did not include this. There is no third-party beneficiary. What about the de facto merger doctrine? The courts in this situation said: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ferris</i>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>v. Glen Alden</i> involved the acquiring
company issuing stock, which in the old days was a requirement of statutory
merger. Where cash or notes are used, it
doesn’t apply. Also, this is a liability
that came into being <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>after</i> the
amalgamation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
court, then much more pro-plaintiff than it is now, said: “Not to worry. On this narrow set of facts, we will create
by a tort doctrine the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>product
continuation</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>doctrine</i>.” When the acquiring corporation continues the
name and product line <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>after </i>amalgamation,
injury from a machine built <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>before </i>by
the selling corporation will, as a matter of tort law, attach to the acquiring
corporation. This case is not followed
in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, and probably not in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
either. In other states, it runs the
spectrum. In <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>,
this doctrine has been embraced, while in other states, they have either
modified the doctrine or have declined to follow it. From a planning standpoint, if you’re a cash
purchaser of a product line, the only way to protect yourself is to force the
selling corporation, at its expense, to buy <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tail
insurance</i> covering both the selling and purchasing corporations. That’s the only way, in a number of states,
that you can protect yourself.</p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc76297533"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Control share acquisition</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This method of merger is dealt with in R.C. 1701.831 along
with the definitions in R.C. 1701.01. You can, either with a public or private company, simply buy the
controlling bloc, up to 100%, of the stock of the acquired corporation! This can be done tax-free if you use your own
voting stock to buy it, Internal Revenue Code § 368(a)(1)(B). Why might you do
that? The acquired corporation may have
franchises, contracts, and mortgage notes that would cause real problems if you
tried to buy the assets. The mortgage
might be due and payable if you sell the assets! There may be employment contracts with the
acquired company that are very valuable, yet it may be unclear if the employees
would be obligated to come aboard. But
if you buy the company, those people still need to come to work for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that company</i>. This mode differs from the other two in an
important way: the board of directors has no legal veto power! With a statutory merger or a sale of all
assets, the board of directors <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does</i>
have a theoretical and sometimes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual</i>
veto power. With this technique, you can
make an end run around the board of directors! Then you can boot those guys off the board of directors or expand the
board and take control!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two flavors of control share acquisition:</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Subscriptions versus options</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A true option gives the holder the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>duty</i>, to buy something. So if you buy the option but then discover
it’s a bad deal, you can walk away without paying anything except what you paid
for the option. If it’s a subscription,
you must look at the common law and statutes. Generally speaking, in most states, these are the rules:</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li style='mso-list:l5 level1 lfo11;tab-stops:list .5in'>A

     Code.)</li>
 <li style='mso-list:l5 level1 lfo11;tab-stops:list .5in'>In
     nearly all states, the company need not give consideration to the
     subscriber in order for it to be a valid contract.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many statutes expressly so provide, and
     when there is no statute on it and there are two or more subscribers subscribing
     on the strength of each other’s subscription, then you know from <i
     style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cordozo</i> that the consideration is
     supplied by the mutuality of the two or more subscribers.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute will usually say that the
     board may call the subscription at any time consistent with the agreement.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute will usually further provide
     that the board of directors may <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>release</i>
     one or more subscribers. But there
     are two exceptions:</li>
 <ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a>
  <li style='mso-list:l5 level2 lfo11;tab-stops:list 1.0in'>It’s
      not at all clear that they can do that without liability to the

  <li style='mso-list:l5 level2 lfo11;tab-stops:list 1.0in'>Under
      the law of contracts, if you release one subscriber, you may well release
      <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> unless the others consent
      to the release because, in a number of states, if there is joint
      liability in contract and you release <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one</i>
      of the obligees, the others are automatically released unless they have <i
      style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>consented</i>.</li>
 </ol>
 <li style='mso-list:l5 level1 lfo11;tab-stops:list .5in'>Subscriptions
     to stocks or bonds are themselves securities for the purposes of the
     federal securities laws. You must
     find an exemption. But here in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
     under R.C. 1707.02 and .03, there is an exception for certain
     subscriptions, but that will do you no good because you will still have to
     find a federal exemption.</li>
 <li style='mso-list:l5 level1 lfo11;tab-stops:list .5in'>If

     accurate.</li>
</ol>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Can the board of directors call the subscriptions even if
the company is nearly insolvent? It
varies a lot by state. The bottom line
here is that the subscriber is usually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>legally
obligated to purchase</i>. That’s the
difference between the two!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297535"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Par value</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Historically, if you go back 130 years, par value tended to
represent the value of the stock. If
people thought the common shares were worth $100 per share, then par value
would be $100. That is no longer true
except with respect to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>preferred stock</i>. If you’re selling preferred stock for $100,
it will almost invariably be put at $100 par. Also, in a lot of foreign countries, the old understanding is still in
place. In modern usage, you can use no
par stock, but you should never use it. Also, don’t ever use high par stock except for preferred stock. You should use $0.01 par stock for common
stock, even if you’re selling for $40 per share. Sometimes they’ll even make it $0.0001! They do that because of franchise taxes,
stock issuance taxes and transfer taxes. What does this have to do with par value? In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and many other states, if you use no par stock, the franchise tax is computed
on the fair market value of your assets. But if you use par value, it’s computed on the par value of your stock
and therefore if you’ve used $0.01 par or $0.0001 par, the franchise tax will
be a lot lower. Neither <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
or <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State> have stock issuance
or transfer taxes. Under those statutes,
you’ll end up getting screwed if you use no par or high par value.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So why do we still have par value? In Revised Model Business Corporation Act
states, you can choose to do without it! In fact, very few people take advantage of this. They use $0.01 par except for preferred stock
because loan agreements, note agreements, and trust indentures, some going back
70-80 years are tied to par value. Also,
occasionally, par value is very useful in that a high par value restricts the
board of directors on dividends because, in a nutshell, under the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
dividend statutes, R.C. 1701.27-.37, the board of directors can declare
dividends only out of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>surplus</i>. Surplus, generally speaking, is the excess of
consideration for stock over par value (that’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>capital </i>surplus) and accumulated earnings (that’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>earned</i> surplus). If the par is high, the board of directors,
acting alone, is restricted on dividends.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Consider this hypothetical: a corporation is organized by
Promoter, who takes 600 shares, with his friends taking 400 shares. Each share has a par value of $1,000 per
share and each investor pays $1,000 per share in cash. The company thinks it’s going to need
$1,000,000. After they set up the
company, they see that they need only $500,000. The board of directors consists of Promoter and two subordinates at the
company. Can the company return the
extra $500,000 as dividends by themselves? No, they can’t, because there’s no surplus! There is no earned surplus because the
company has just been set up, and there’s no capital surplus because $1,000 par
has been issued.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How could they pay a dividend? They’ll have to go to the shareholders under
R.C. 1701.69-.72 for a charter amendment (let’s assume the amendment is to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reduce the par value</i> from $1,000 per
share to $1 per share). If they do that,
under R.C. 1701.27-.37 and .69-.72, there will be created $999,000 in capital
surplus and the dividend can then be paid. Promoter and his friends on the board will have to call a shareholders’
meeting and get 67 votes to go with Promoter’s 600 votes to amend the
charter. On these facts, he could
probably do it. But if Paul and his
buddies declared the dividends without doing this, under R.C. 1701.95, they are
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>personally liable </i>to the corporation
jointly and severally for $500,000!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hanewald v. Bryan’s
Inc.</i> – If an investor buys $100 par stock for $1 per share and buys 1,000
shares, the corporation can come back to that investor and recover
$99,000. There is no way out of it! The statute expressly says that the corporation
can do that! The incorporation includes
a trustee in bankruptcy or a state court receiver, and if things go belly up,
they’ll write another check for $99,000. This is why investors want an opinion from their attorney and the
attorney for the company that the stock is fully paid and non-assessable. This case says that if you have such a
statute, the creditors themselves can directly go after the hapless investor
who thinks he’s got a bargain.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statute provides that if the directors, in good faith, value assets, then the
remedy may be cut off. If our investor
has Blackacre, which has no liens attached and he says it’s worth $100,000 and
the directors, in good faith, value it at $100,000, then he will not be
liable. But caution: if he <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knows</i> it’s not worth $100,000, there may
be fraud. In modern times on a
transaction that big, the board would often get an independent appraisal that
would show the watered stock. The board
will get statements certified by CPAs who will insist upon an independent
appraisal. The securities laws can
easily be violated by watered stock, inflated assets and the like. Remember that these are questions the
attorney for the company must go over before he issues an opinion that the
stock is duly and validly issued and is non-assessable.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Suppose your stock has $5 par value to it, but it’s now
trading for $1 and you have to have $500,000 in order to survive. Can you sell 500,000 shares to an investor
for $1 and avoid these rules? An old
U.S. Supreme Court case indicates that the answer is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>maybe yes</i>. Suppose you have
an option to buy stock. You will always
include in it an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anti-dilution</i>
provision. In other words, if there is a
100% stock dividend, you’ll up the amount of shares you can purchase by
doubling and halve the number of shares you purchase by one-half. Suppose you have an option to buy $5 par
preferred stock for $5 and there is a 100% stock dividend. That means you can purchase double the amount
of shares for $2.50 per share. But the
stock still has a $5 par value, and you’re screwed! As a part of the anti-dilution clause, there
is a provision that says that you won’t take action that will push the fair
market value below par value.</p>

<p>If you go back 25 years, the Ohio Supreme Court cases had
all held that you need fraud or sham to disregard the corporate fiction. Since then, a Sixth Circuit case and an Ohio
Supreme Court case that expanded the grounds somewhat for disregarding the corporate
fiction. After that, you see a bunch of
Ohio Court of Appeals opinions. These
opinions differ, some saying that Ohio law is now pretty much like the law of
any other jurisdiction, others saying that the two big cases did not open
things up that broadly. A third group of
cases have given an extensive definition to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraud</i>
and have included constructive and equitable fraud along with “hardcore” legal
fraud. So in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
you’ll have to read a bunch of cases and carefully qualify the extent of the
opinions you give to clients because no one is completely sure where <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>Courts used to say that there were preemptive rights in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
unless the charter provided otherwise. A
few years ago, the statute was amended as to newly formed corporations. Now we have an “opt-in” situation rather than
an “opt-out” situation. You don’t have
statutory preemptive rights unless the charter so provides. <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
has always been an opt-in state in modern times.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Generally, if new stock in a corporation is issued, it must
be offered to all shareholders on a proportional basis. But there are common law exceptions. The big case in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
on preemptive rights is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Barsan v. Pioneer</i>. It follows the <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>
authority. This case made a point about <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>waiver</i>. Shareholder by shareholder, there can be a waiver. If all shareholders waive, then there is no
problem. The waiver can be formal (in writing),
or it can be informal (by conduct). That’s one common law exception. Next up comes non-cash property. When stock is issued for non-cash property, meaning a corporation wants
to issue common stock to a non-shareholder in exchange for some property owned
by that non-shareholder. Shipman doesn’t
know how this exception is consistent with the rationale for preemptive
rights! When a company makes a non-only
purchase of another company, that’s non-cash property and will also fit within
the common law exceptions. Preemptive
rights are a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sticky issue</i>!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Generally, when public companies go public in an opt-out
state, they will often amend their articles to deny preemptive rights. That can be done under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law, and no appraisal right is involved. Considering the problems posed by preemptive rights, few <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
lawyers organizing a new company in the old days opted out in the original
charter. Shipman finds this
interesting. He thinks this will change
with the “opt-in” situation. If you have
preemptive rights you can have problems!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
preemptive rights are dealt with in R.C. 1701.14-.20. In older <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
companies, there generally won’t be an opt-out, and the change won’t apply to a
company established before the change. The common law exceptions are actually built into R.C. 1701.14 along
with some other exceptions. This section
says that if you’re subject to preemptive rights, you can, without a
shareholder’s meeting and without a charter amendment, “bless” the transaction
if you get shareholders owning two-thirds or more of the stock to say that
preemptive rights will not apply to that transaction. Note that if you do that, you must
immediately notify all shareholders of what you’ve done. Also, this provision exists “on top of” the
common law waiver provision. Preemptive
rights can exist by contract among the shareholders. There are a number of cases where, when you
deal you a close corporation, you find that there is a shareholders’ voting
agreement (per R.C. 1701.591) that has contractual preemptive rights provisions
in it. There are situations where the
shareholders want the proportionate ownership kept.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This affects lawyers in a big way! Lawyers are often called upon to issue the
opinion that stock is “duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and
non-assessable”. Does this opinion
include “no violation of anybody’s preemptive rights”? There’s disagreement on this point! Careful lawyers for purchasers request a
second paragraph that says: “Issuance of the stock does not contravene
anybody’s preemptive rights under the charter, the statute, or any contract or
agreement”.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here’s an example: in the first merger, all the shareholders
voted yes, but the lawyer forgot to amend the articles to take out preemptive
rights. Down the road, under new
management, they didn’t realize that preemptive rights were still there. They sued the lawyer in the first
transaction, and Shipman argues that the lawyer’s opinion was correct.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hyman v. Velsicol
Corp.</i> – This is an old case with a lot of lessons for us. There was an <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation, two capitalists, and one sweat equity. It was a start up, and everyone put in an
equal amount of cash. With start-ups,
you’ll need more money down the road! You’ll seldom make it on the first infusion of money. The company needed more money. The two capitalists owned two-thirds of the
stock and were two of the three directors. The board of directors authorized the corporation to sell a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>huge</i> number of new shares for a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>huge </i>amount of money. The company was under preemptive rights. Each shareholder was notified of his right to
subscribe to a third of the offering at the stipulated price. The two capitalists, who planned the issue,
had the money for their one-third. But
sweat equity didn’t have the money!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So sweat equity sues under the theory of fiduciary
duties. The two capitalists were technically
complying with preemptive rights. If
sweat equity could have afforded it he could have exercised his right to buy
one-third of the new shares. Preemptive
rights doesn’t displace fiduciary duties! In a close corporation, the officers, directors, and controlling
shareholders owe <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strong</i> fiduciary
duties to each other. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i> codifies that
doctrine. So sweat equity asks for an
injunction stopping the issue because he has no money and after the issue he’ll
only own a few percent of the enterprise. We’re told that the injunction was denied, but we don’t get all the
facts. Sweat equity came into court with
unclean hands! Those who seek equity
must do equity! Sweat equity had gone to
work for a competitor and the <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
court held that under the unclean hands doctrine there was no relief on the
fiduciary duty theory. The capitalists
“kissed the books” correctly on the preemptive rights doctrine!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What other lessons can we draw from this case? If you represent a sweat equity type and the
startup is in corporate form, sweat equity will want a clause saying: “If new
money is needed for capitalist, they will advance it for preferred stock that
is not participating or voting, or else they will advance it as debt.” In a high-tech startup, sweat equity wants to
be a major owner when the enterprise goes public. This will entail <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>heavy bargaining</i>, but keep in mind what sweat equity’s point
is. If the startup is in a limited
liability company, the problem is going to be there, but it will be much less
acute. The contractual provisions
protecting sweat equity while dealing with the capitalists can be dealt with a
lot more easily as an LLC with the Internal Revenue Code. LLCs are very good for startup ventures in
that Sub K is simply more flexible than Sub C or Sub S.</p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297538"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Common law rule regarding indemnification
without a contract</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>An agent can get indemnification from the principal if four
conditions are met: (1) The agent is not negligent. (2) There is no crime. (3) The agent acts within the scope of his
employment. (4) The agent violates no
implied or express work rule.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 codifies this rule at §
18. The leading case on the rule is a <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>
trial court case from the 1800s called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>D’Arcy</i>,
in which a <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State> principal
sent his agent down to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Haiti</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and through no fault of the agent, he got thrown in jail and he had to
litigate. The agent finally got out of
jail and back to <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>,
where he sued the principal for indemnification for the litigation
expenses. It was held that he made out
the case and would be entitled to indemnification even though he had no
contract for indemnification with the principal.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>That’s the rule as of 1930. Then, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McCollum</i>, a <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> trial court case from about 1940 shocked the
corporate world! McCollum was an
executive of a company that’s now part of ExxonMobil. In the 1930’s, a number of the oil companies
engaged in fixing the price of oil. There were large downward pressures on oil and many of the company did
“naughty things” in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The government brought a lot of cases and got
a lot of convictions. But when they
brought the criminal case against McCollum, he paid the expenses out of his own
pocket and got an acquittal. Then he
asked his employer for indemnification, but the employer refused and he sued
based on the common law principle of agency law. This case added a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>fifth</i> requirement to those on the board: McCollum didn’t show any
benefit to the employer, and therefore he couldn’t get indemnified! Some states refused to follow McCollum. They followed the “classic statement”.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>After World War II, statutes came about like R.C.
1701.13(E). In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
it’s § 144. In Ohio, if you’re sued in
your corporate capacity either by or on behalf of the corporation or by a third
party and you prevail on the merits or otherwise (such as based on statute of
limitations), then you are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>absolutely
entitled </i>to indemnification from the company. This doesn’t mean you don’t have to have
insurance. Insurance and indemnification
don’t completely overlap. Your rights
under indemnification are no better than the solvency of the corporation. But if you have an insurance policy that
covers you, then the insolvency of the company you work for doesn’t affect your
insurance coverage, assuming, of course, that your insurance company is
solvent. Therefore, your R.C.
1701.13(E)(3) right against a corporation might not be worth much.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>R.C. 1701.13(E)(5)(b) says that if you’re sued in your
corporate capacity, the board of directors <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i>
advance your attorney’s fees. R.C.
1701.13(E)(1) talks about suits <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>by</i> or
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on behalf of </i>the company, while R.C.
1701.13(E)(2) talks about third party suits including shareholder actions,
creditor actions, actions under the securities laws, and actions under criminal
provisions. Both statutes say that other
certain circumstances, the board of directors <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>may</i> indemnify you. (E)(1)
and (E)(2) do not have any “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must</i>”
language in them. But here’s the new kid
on the block from the 1980’s: R.C. 1701.13(E)(5)(a), which also deals with
attorney’s fees. This is a “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must</i>” provision. If you’re sued in your corporate capacity and
you make a demand on the company, the company<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> must</i> pay your reasonable attorney’s fees monthly subject to one <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big</i> condition: you must sign a written
undertaking to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonably</i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cooperate</i>, and if you are found to have
been reckless in discharging your duties, you will have to reimburse the
corporation for such attorney’s fees advanced.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the 1980’s, we also got R.C. 1701.59(D) and
1701.59(F). (D) provides that in an
action <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>by </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>on behalf of </i>the corporation against you, if you were acting in
your corporate capacity, no money damages will be awarded unless you are found
to have been reckless. (D) applies only
to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directors</i>, and the same is true of
.13(E)(5)(a), except Shipman thinks that the latter applies to a director <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>acting as an officer</i> and it may turn out
that .59(D) also does. R.C. 1701.59(F)
makes it clear that (D) does not apply to a suit against a director in his
capacity as a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>controlling shareholder</i>. We’ll get back to the duties of controlling
shareholders later. The infamous <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Smith v. Van Gorkum</i> brought
about these statutes. The <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
statute differs somewhat from the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
provisions. For the <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
provisions to apply, the shareholders must vote it in, but in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
it’s just the opposite: they apply unless the shareholders vote it out.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Merritt-Chapman &amp;
Scott Corp. v. Wolfson</i> – Wolfson was a “corporate bad boy” of the 1960’s and
1970’s. He was the director of a public
company and the federal government claimed that he violated the securities
laws, so they brought a criminal action against him in two or three trials. He won on some of the counts, but the
government won on some other counts. Other charges were dropped as the case went along. The question is how the <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
version of (E)(3) worked. The decision
is very pro-director. The court held
that: (1) You can prevail in different ways: either by acquittal or by a second
trial where the government drops a charge. (2) It is not all-or-nothing, that is, Wolfson should allocate his legal
expenses among the various counts and as to the allocated expenses, to those
counts where he prevailed, he is entitled to indemnification.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Justice Department, in its sentencing guidelines, wants
corporations <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> to indemnify, and
the pressure is on corporations to cut loose accused executives and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stomp</i> on them.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Director and officer’s liability insurance is
important. If you’re advising a client,
don’t go on a board without it. Look at
the coverage and exclusion clauses of the insurance policy. Coverage clauses are usually construed
broadly to protect the insured, and exclusion clauses are generally construed
narrowly against the insurer. What are
some of the big provisions? In the
exclusion clauses, you’ll find exclusions for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>dishonesty</i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraud</i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>criminal conduct</i>, and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intentionality</i>. Just what is intentionality? In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
§ 102, we’re told that these new clauses can apply only to actions under the
fiduciary duty of care and not under the fiduciary duty of loyalty. Ohio R.C. 1701.59(D) and .13(E)(5)(a) don’t
make that distinction. The courts have
held that if the action is a duty of loyalty action against a director or
officer, and all that’s shown at trial is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inadvertent</i>
breach of the duty of loyalty, Delaware § 102 will apply. Shipman thinks that the same rule applies
here.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What’s another big exclusion? One is Rule 10(b)(5) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. ERISA is also an
exclusion. The biggest headache is a
clause that says: “If the director or officer received some corporate benefit
that other shareholders did not receive in proportion to their stock holding,
then the policy will not apply.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This gets us into the way policies have been drafted for the
last 35 years. In the old days, the
policies were written as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>occurrence</i>
policies. If you bought a policy for the
calendar year 2004 but you didn’t get sued until 2010 under a discovery rule, that
occurrence policy would cover you. But
the problem with this type of policy from the insurance companies’ standpoint
is that it has a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>long tail</i>; the
insurance companies can’t figure out how much they’re on the hook for. So about thirty years ago, the insurance
companies switched to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>claims made</i>
policies. Today, your D &amp; O policy
will cover you for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>claims made </i>in
2004 with two additions, one going backward and one going forward: (1) if you
notify the insurer in 2004 of something that may give rise to a claim and the
claim is made later, then the 2004 policy will cover you. (2) If you’re buying a policy from the
company for the first time in 2004, things that you fully disclose in detail to
them that happened earlier can, for an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>additional
premium</i>, be covered.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When a professional retires, they purchase <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tail coverage</i>. Tail coverage will cover things that come up
in the future. The premium will usually
be one and one half to three times your usual annual premium. The application for tail coverage or for
looking backwards is going to have a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very</i>
complete disclosure provision in it. The
insured and the insurance company must deal with each other in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>utmost good faith</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McCullough v. Fidelity
&amp; Deposit Co.</i> – This case dealt with a bank that had generally informed
its insurance company that there had been a bank examination. If the insurance company had read the full
examiner’s report, they would have seen that a bunch of claims were about to
break loose. The court held that in
order for the “forward looking” out to apply, you must be specific and detailed
in your reporting to the insurance company. Shipman says that McCullough should have hired a lawyer.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here’s one more situation where you can get your attorneys’
fees. The outside legal counsel for a corporation
is asked to review a proposed merger in detail. He does so using reasonable care and he gives a written opinion to the
directors and officers that, in his opinion, neither federal nor state
antitrust statutes are violated by the transaction. Three years later, the Justice Department
sues the corporation and the officers and directors claiming that it <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does</i> violate the antitrust laws. The outside lawyer in that situation will
recommend to the board that he enter an appearance for both the corporation and
the directors and officers because he advised <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all</i> of them that in his opinion he thought it was legal. He would say that because he advised <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>everyone</i> that way, there is no conflict
of interest. What he is trying to fight
is the government strategy, which is to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>divide
and conquer</i>. It is perfectly proper
for the outside counsel to make an appearance for everyone and handle the
litigation since they were proceeding on his authority. The board of directors will go along with
this and allow it. It’s not literally
covered by .13, but it is a form of indemnification of attorneys’ fees that
happens <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>every day</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Connected with that and relevant to today’s discussion is
the defense of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>good faith reliance</i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on legal counsel</i>. Here are the leading authorities on this: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Maness v. Myers</i> from the U.S. Supreme
Court, which deals with the lawyer’s side. The client was selling “girlie” magazines. But were they hardcore pornography or not? In a civil proceeding, the government asked
for the production of the magazine, and the lawyer advised him against it. There was a court hearing, and the judge
asked the client why he didn’t submit, and he said that his lawyer gave him a
legal opinion that he didn’t have to. The judge issued a contempt order for the lawyer, and the U.S. Supreme
Court held that insofar as the lawyer is concerned, if you give advice to a
client in good faith that precludes recklessness, then a court has no
jurisdiction to enter a contempt order against you under the Sixth Amendment.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here are a couple of journal articles. One article in the Vanderbilt Law Review by
Hawes said that when there is reasonable reliance on counsel by a client, it
proves good faith and reasonable care by the client. But there are causes of action where you can
lose even if you’re not negligent and you’re in good faith. But the role of the lawyer in this area in
giving opinions is crucial. Under <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
§ 102, if there is an inadvertent breach of the duty of loyalty, you can get
protection. If people have relied on reasonable
advice of counsel, then they’re okay too. But sometimes clients hold back key facts from their lawyer. Also, the lawyer’s opinion will often tell
them that something is legal if you do these four things, but then in the real
world, clients will thumb their nose at one of the things and only do three
things. The things may be very
onerous! But the role of lawyers is
crucial. So is the role of CPAs. If you have a truly independent CPA and you
disclose everything to her and she comes back with what looks like a reasonable
statement, and you have fully disclosed and her credentials and reputation are
good, then they’ll have trouble getting at you. This will be an issue in the Enron case.</p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297539"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Indemnification</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We covered the agency common law doctrines whereby under
agency law the agent is sometimes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entitled</i>
to indemnification from the principal without getting any deeper. In theory, this is a doctrine separate from <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exoneration</i> and R.C. 1701.59(D) is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pure exoneration statute</i>. R.C. 1701.13(E)(5)(a) is an indemnification
statute. But there are times when a
statute is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both </i>an exoneration and an
indemnification statute. If, for
example, a trust agreement provides that in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i>
suit against the trustee by or on behalf of the trust or its beneficiaries, the
trustee will be held <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>harmless</i> by the
assets of the trust then the agreement is both indemnification and exoneration. But that wouldn’t be legal under trust
law. The most that a provision in a
trust agreement can exonerate the trustee for in suits by beneficiaries is
gross negligence. Trust law is more
demanding than corporate law and more demanding than general indemnification
law.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It is still fairly standard in a tort case if there are two
defendants and one is negligent while another has committed an intentional tort
like fraud, it is fairly widespread that the judgment that the court will enter
in that case is joint and several liability on the part of both defendants to
the plaintiff, but the defendant that is negligent is entitled to
indemnification from the defendant who committed the intentional tort. What about comparative negligence? Case after case has held that comparative
negligence statutes by themselves do not preclude this result. A <st1:State><st1:place>Louisiana</st1:place></st1:State>
court has held that you cannot apply comparative negligence to
intentionality. But <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> cases in the past fifteen years have held that
if even if due care had been used, the intentional actor was smart enough that
he would have committed the tort anyway. Out west and in the south, you’ll find a number of states that have
eliminated joint and several liability by statute. They call for percentage allocation rather
than joint and several liability. Shipman has his doubts whether these statutes would apply when one
person is intentional and one is negligent. He thinks that the intentional actor will be 100% liable. But indemnification comes up a lot in torts.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A contract of indemnity is subject to the rule that to the
extent it purports to cover recklessness or intentionality it is invalid
because if, for example, Al Capone could have gotten indemnity for the St.
Valentine’s Day Massacre, there would have been twenty massacres! In most states, insurance can cover
recklessness but it can’t cover intentionality. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> within the past
twenty years, we have had two opinions in the cases of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Worth v. Aetna </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Worth v.
Huntington Bank</i>. What was involved
was an indemnity contract whereby the contract provision called for one party
to bear the other party’s attorney’s fees. This is the place to start your research in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
because they review the cases of the last 40 years. In some areas, in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
you can’t even indemnify for negligence. Generally, though, provision for attorney’s fees is not valid. The court held a special situation that
involved a contract for attorney’s fees.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here’s an Agent Orange case: soldiers couldn’t sue the
government, so they tried to sue government contractors. Scalia established a government contractor
defense. If a contractor warns the
government that the specifications will produce a defective contract, then the
government contractor has a complete defense. The company that was one of the manufacturers of Agent Orange sued
because they had settled with veterans who had been badly injured. The Court of Claims decision was appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court. Rehnquist denied
relief on two grounds: (1) the government contractor defense had not be
properly used by the manufacturer, and (2) the Courts of Claims, AKA the United
States Claims Court, has no equity jurisdiction and no jurisdiction in
restitution.</p>

<p>In the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Globus</i> case,
involving the first company in the country trying to apply computers to legal
research, there had been a public offering of the company’s stock, and the
underwriter (broker-dealer firm) buying it from the company and reselling it
had extracted an indemnification agreement from the issuer. That agreement was carefully drafted and it
excluded reckless and intentional action by the underwriter. You can bet that the underwriter wanted an
opinion from the lawyer for the company that the contract was valid, and the
lawyer for the company knew that on common law grounds, it would not be valid
if it covered reckless or intentional misconduct. The underwriter got sued and had to pay a
judgment because the offering circular to the public was misleading. The underwriter then sued the issuer on the
indemnification contract under state law. But it excluded reckless or intentional conduct. It was proven at trial that the underwriter
knew of the deficiency in the offering circular! So the opinion should have been really
short. Instead, the court held in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Globus I</i> that they would make it a
federal question! The federal securities
laws themselves, on top of state law, limit indemnification for securities
misdeeds. They remanded to the district
court for a remedy, the case came back up, and they held in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Globus II</i> that under federal law, no
indemnification, but they would allow 50-50 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contribution</i>. Most lawyers in their opinions will now put
in a paragraph disclaiming any opinion on indemnification where federal securities
laws are involved.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When you make a public offering, you must put in the
prospectus an agreement with the SEC that the company will not pay off unless a
court first determines otherwise by declaratory judgment. When prosecutors go after a company they try
to force them not to indemnify their corporate executives. That is, they would try to force an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
company <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> to pay out under R.C.

regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 was engaged in
front-running. He had inside information
on what the company was going to buy, and so he went and bought that same stuff
before the company did, and he also sold before the company did. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>That violates § 17 of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, and it’s a serious conflict of interest. You can only engage in this activity if the
commission blesses it in advance. The
SEC sued him for an injunction, and they got it. But the equities aren’t all on one side. Before he did this, he went to the inside
lawyer for the company and disclosed what he wanted to do. The lawyer said that it was okay! The director then applied, under <st1:State><st1:place>Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>
law, to the company for indemnification. The state had a statute like R.C. 1701.13(E). The board of directors refused under
.13(E)(1) and (2). He goes into court to
force the board to pay it. The opinion
is mostly a reading of the statute, which says that the board <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i> indemnify in (E)(1) and (2). Only (E)(3) has a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>must</i>. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>However</i>, at the end of the opinion, they say: “By the way…the
indemnification statute says that they will indemnify you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>qua</i> director, and when the guy engaged in front-running, he changed
personality and became a non-corporate individual! <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In that incarnation, you’re not entitled to
indemnification!”</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There is a New Mexico case that follows on New Mexico’s
version of (E)(3), where a big public utility started a suit against a
director, who counterclaimed and moved under FRCP Rule 65 for a TRO saying that
they can’t continue their part of the suit unless they agree to pay his
attorneys’ fees. The court held that
(E)(3) means <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exactly what it says</i>. It was clear there that the director was
acting in his corporate capacity. The
courts go all different ways in this area.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:City><st1:place>Toledo</st1:place></st1:City>, a big
public company asked a guy to join their board. Unbeknownst to the company, Mr. X was the 100% shareholder of a closely
held manufacturing company. Under the
SEC proxy rules, he should have disclosed that to the company because it should
go into the proxy statement. The public
company entered into a lot of business with the closely held company. Then they found out and when to the United
States Attorney’s office, asking them to lock up Mr. X. Mr. X paid the attorneys’ fees out of his own
pocket and got an acquittal. Then he
asked for $1.5 million in attorneys’ fees under (E)(3). The company asserted <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tomash</i>, but the matter went to arbitration. The arbitrator didn’t buy the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tomash</i> argument and entered a judgment
of $1.5 million in Mr. X’s favor. Remember that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tomash</i> is there,
but it will sometimes be overlooked because it is quite subtle. It’s a “first cousin” of the insurance
policies exclusion for the director getting a benefit that the other
shareholders don’t get in proportion to their stock holdings.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you’re representing an executive, your remedy is a
counterclaim for attorneys’ fees, and you move under Rule 65 for a preliminary
and permanent injunction forcing the company to pay your attorneys’ fees as the
case progresses. Merely putting that in
your answer is not enough. You must file
a motion for an immediate hearing! Go to
the clerk or judge and ask for an early hearing on the issue.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here’s a hypothetical from prior exams: a woman is a
director of a company and she is charged with sexual harassment. She is the president (the #2 officer) and the
#1 officer, the CEO, calls the outside counsel and asks the counsel to
investigate. Can the regular outside
counsel do this? Yes, assuming you have
not advised the president on this issue. You must give the president a “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miranda</i>”
warning that you’re only representing the company and not the woman. But what if you represent the woman? You must file the written demand for
attorneys’ fees. But will you get
it? There are two issues and they’re
close: (1) is the internal corporate investigation a “proceeding”? Shipman thinks so. (2) Does the CEO have the power, without
going to the board, to order the outside law firm to do this? Sure, no problem. (3) Does this fit within (E)(5)(a)? Shipman thinks so, but there are equal
employment overtones and if you’re the outside law firm conducting the
investigation, you have a duty to conduct a fair proceeding.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>The hypothetical</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But I didn’t have a chance to get the hypothetical down.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How do we approach a problem? <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Rule
things out.</i> First consider the ultra
vires/1701.13 problem. The corporate
charter must have an “all lawful business” clause. If there is an ultra vires problem, you go to
1701.69-.72. There must be a charter
amendment and it will likely create appraisal rights. What about 1701.14 preemptive rights? Under .14 and the common law, if you’re
issuing stock for non-cash property, there is an exception. What about fiduciary duties under
1701.59? Due diligence must be done
concerning a transaction. You must get
financial statements. Rule 10b-5 applies
to a securities offering. The U.S.
Supreme Court, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gustafson</i> in the
1980’s,<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>held that 12(a)(2) doesn’t
apply to unregistered private offerings. § 14(e) deals with tender offers for any security, public or private,
but it must be a tender offer. The big
worries of the guy are going to be §§ 1707.38-.45 and .29. The criminal mens rea test in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ordinary negligence</i>. Plus .38-.45 state a negligence test and say
that if the company is liable, the directors are liable unless they were <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-negligent</i>. If there is no directors’ and officers’
insurance policy, the guy should resign. Otherwise, what’s in it for the guy?</p>

<p><b>The instructions for
the exam</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It will be three hours long and it will where the registrar
says it is. There are two key
points. We’ll be an associate at a law
firm. It will have an office in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and also a community property state Z that’s not <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>,
<st1:State><st1:place>Louisiana</st1:place></st1:State>, or <st1:State><st1:place>Arizona</st1:place></st1:State>
or <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>. It also has an office in common law state X,
not <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. We work for a senior partner at the firm who
is a trial lawyer. He’s admitted in all
three jurisdictions. People come to him
for all kinds of reasons. We have to
produce a preliminary memo to him. As
the case progresses, this will be fleshed out. But the partner usually has a conference with the client and he wants to
know roughly what is involved. We’re
told it’s okay to be concise, but don’t be brief. Raise the issues and state the arguments, pro
and con. Look for ambiguities in the
facts. Look for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>courses</i> of action as well as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>causes
of action</i>. What should people <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do</i>? Allocate your time <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>brutally</i>. Make sure you don’t leave any questions
blank! Most of Shipman’s questions will
be set in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> and will involve <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>December 1996 Exam
Question One</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, we can assume that all conflicts of
interest have been cleared. We can also
assume that all clients are paying by the hour. Here we have BCD, Inc. formed in 1985 by Mr. Smith, who purchased
1,000,000 shares for $.01 each at par. His sister, as an accommodation, purchased 50,000 shares at the same
price. The sister is a physician and has
a lot of money. None of the other
directors has much wealth. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles are applied. In auditing the statements of a company, the auditors proceed under
GAAS: Generally Accepted Auditing Standards.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Sarbanes-Oxley caused an accounting oversight board to be
created. Its relationship to the FASB
has yet to be determined. Its
relationship to accounting standards is going to be quite heavy. The money for FASB and the Accounting
Oversight Board comes from fees charged to public companies. The AOB is subject to oversight by the SEC.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>CPAs are licensed by individual states. There’s a standard nationwide exam, so it’s
pretty easy to get admitted in different states as long as you pay the
fees. The CPA owes its first duty to
public investors and creditors. Then
they owe a duty to the company. The
independent CPA firm is paid to “tattle” on the person that pays it! It’s like being required to pay your spouse’s
lover.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There is some chance that the insurance company will say
that the coverage doesn’t fly, and the insurance company will probably
win. So there’s probably no
coverage! She wants to know what her
exposure is. There will be big legal
fees.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>First we’ll want to see whether she had no knowledge or
reason to know of the cooked books. There are no criminal worries if this is true. There could be a trustee in bankruptcy
action, but there probably isn’t recklessness on the part of our client. Her medical license should be dealt with by a
lawyer in the firm who deals with the medical board. We must show that she had no knowledge. So hopefully her medical license will not be
affected. What about taxes? If she received money for being a director,
then her legal fees and what she has to pay in settlement will be tax
deductible. She has a good income as a
physician. So talk to a tax lawyer. This may all be deductible as she pays
it. She might ask whether she should
transfer assets to her husband. No,
because that would be a fraudulent conveyance and it would also look bad in the
litigation. Hopefully, she has a family
trust for the benefit of her husband and children with spendthrift clauses.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In practice, you’ll find that the independent investment
advisor and the estate and tax lawyers are always trying to get people to set
up trusts with spendthrift clauses. But
it’s hard to get people to do that. There’s a substantial gift tax payable and they don’t want to part with
control of the money.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If we can show that she is “pure as the driven snow”, then
we’re in good shape because it’s hard to prove scienter against someone who is
trying to do the right thing. This is
for the purposes of Rule 10b-5. In
addition, the 1995 Federal Act puts a number of procedural inhibitions upon
plaintiffs who want to file. You can get
around them with a good case, like the Citigroup case, where the plaintiff’s
lawyer knew just how to get around it. §
12(a)(2) is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strict privity</i> section,
and she wasn’t in strict privity with any of the victims. But we must double check that she hasn’t
pulled a “Martha” in the last couple of weeks. She says the first news she had was yesterday, but we must make sure she
wasn’t selling any stock before that.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about § 11? The
first big deal is that this statute is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>negligence</i>-based. If a plaintiff’s lawyer has a shot at good money
under § 11, they’ll go under § 11. But
.38 to .43 of the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> statute is
very close. It’s also
negligence-based. § 11 <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does not apply</i> if there is no <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>registered public offering</i>. In that sense, it’s different from R.C. §
1701.38 to .41 which apply to public and non-public, registered and
non-registered transactions. There is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>semblance</i> of a privity requirement. You must prove that the shares you bought <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>came out of </i>the registered public
offering. You don’t have to be the first
purchaser. You could be the second,
third, fourth or fifth. That requirement
doesn’t help us in the question because all the shares in the public market
came out of the registered public offering. You should always check the statute of limitations; in many cases people
wait too long to sue. In this case, we
can expect that the suits will be filed within the next few days or weeks, so
there will be no statute of limitations defense.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If the defendant can prove no legal cause or
causation-in-fact or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>partial</i> no
causation-in-fact, then that is a defense. There are two <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Franklin</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>County</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
cases in the 1990’s on this. Early in
the 1990’s the Federal Reserve Board kept interest rates fairly low, which
encourages homebuilding. Interest rates
have been fairly low for the last four years and we’ve had a homebuilding
boom. Two separate local homebuilding
companies went public during that period. Unfortunately, about nine months after they went public, the Fed greatly
increased interest rates. Homebuilding
temporarily went to hell. There were §
11 suits against the companies. The
defendants made out either a partial or total § 11(e) defense.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There were bogus accounts receivable and the nature of those
accounts was not disclosed in the prospectus, obviously. The company has virtually no defense under §
11 except the statute of limitations and § 11(e). No plaintiff will collect much of anything
from the companies.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let’s divide the prospectus into the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>narratives</i> and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>certified
financials</i>. As to the narratives,
where the directors are not relying on experts, the director must prove for a
defense: (1) she made a reasonable investigation, and (2) after such reasonable
investigation she reasonably believed the prospectus narrative material to be
true. As to the expert material, the test
is different. There is no requirement of
reasonable investigation as to the certified financials. The test is simple: did the director
reasonably believe the certified financials to be true? In the real world, a lot of material crosses
over between the two categories. It’s
not absolutely clear whether she made a reasonable investigation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about another possible defense for our client? Legislation from the 1990’s provides under §
11 that there is no joint and several liability; it is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>several </i>only. That means
that if we can slot her into that, and the jury finds that of the 100% of fault
involved she contributed only 3%, then we would simply multiply the liability
by the percent and that would be her liability. It would still be a lot of money, but note that if she doesn’t qualify
for this, it’s joint and several liability.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Securities Act of 1933 was based in part upon the
English Companies Act and in part on state “Blue Sky” law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In the English Companies Act, a director <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>can</i> rely in good faith on officers and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>others</i>. That is the law in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
at § 1701.59. It’s also the law in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
at § 141-144. It’s a good faith reliance
rule. As long as you’re not reckless or
worse and your heart is pure, you can rely upon what officers tell you. This looks like an accounting matter,
though. The auditors should have gone
out and “kicked the tires” on some of these post office addresses. That is, they should have traced it to the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual</i> office or factory. Lawyers who are working on a registration
statement and who are careful always do that. The leading case in the area is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Escott</i>,
and it says that you do have to kick the tires. As to important written documents, you must get the actual material and
read it.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Probably the plaintiffs’ lawyers are looking for big money
from the accounting firm. They will want
to settle with our client early. You
like to settle out with peripheral defendants early for modest amounts because
it’s very expensive to finance a class action. Under R.C. 1701.38, Shipman thinks her liability is about the same. What about the liability of the accounting
firm? That’s under § 11 and also under
the Rest.2d of Torts § 552, which is negligence-based and would provide a
similar result to the federal result. The seminal case in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Heddon View </i>from the 1970’s. There are later cases including two in the
1990’s that were decided the same day. The cases hold that comparative negligence will apply if the client was
negligence and caused a tort that damaged himself, you “chop off” that
30-40%. Those cases are especially
important because Shipman thinks that they apply to lawyers. When a lawyer is sued by a client, you’ll
want to throw in the defense of comparative negligence. Is the Restatement § 552 applicable to
lawyers? Not in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. The authority for that comes from <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dublin Securities</i>, reported in the
Bankruptcy Reporter in the 1990’s.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Two or three loose ends from yesterday:</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Would our client from yesterday have any indemnification
rights or rights over the independent CPA firm, the investment banking firm or
the good <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> law firm that
represents the company? A bare
possibility exists against the accounting firm depending on what the GAAS
standards were for alleged debtors with post office express boxes. As to the law firm, Shipman doubts it very
much.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297541"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The law firm’s role in offerings</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Law firms seldom say that they’re undertaking a 100%
investigation or an audit. There are
exceptions to that: if there is a sexual harassment claim in a corporation and
four of the seven directors authorized the investigation of the fifth director,
then the law firm will be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extremely</i>
careful and investigate the facts fully. Generally speaking, however, they expressly state in their opinion that
they are relying on facts <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>supplied by
officers </i>and in the normal course of events, if there is nothing strange
about what the officers tell them, they can do so. Both CPA firms and law firms will sometimes
require <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>officers’ certificates</i>. They will have the officer read, sign and
date it. If you’re an officer, be
careful!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In Sarbanes-Oxley § 404, as to public companies, there has
to be a system of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>firm</i> internal
controls established. This has led to an
elaborate system of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subaffirmations</i>
that top management requires from division managers, addressed to them. This creates additional expense, to the tune
of $4 million a year for a $1 billion company.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>For lawyers, in giving opinions they will negotiate in the
initial agreement that in certain matters they may reasonably rely upon
officers’ certificates. That’s a good
way to cut down on legal cost. In a
public offering, the outside law firm’s duties run in two different directions:
(1) to the officer and directors, and (2) to the quasi-client. If the lawyer knows or reasonably should know
that what is being done violates the law, then the quasi-client (buyer of the
security) can sue the lawyer.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tomash</i>, which
had to do with indemnification, the director there had asked the lawyer for the
company whether what he was doing was legal, and the lawyer said: “Go ahead,
it’s legal.” The lawyer was wrong, and
an SEC injunction was issued against him. His best cause of action was against the corporate lawyer who gave the
advice, and then under respondeat superior against the corporation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about the legal opinion to the underwriters? It’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>long</i>
opinion on many matters. The outside law
firm would be liable to the underwriter. One opinion, for example, is that the corporation has picked the correct
SEC form to file on. In the case of a
mistake, there is clear liability. Lawyers <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i> opine that there
has been <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>full compliance</i> with the
federal securities laws because these laws include <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>anti-fraud</i> provisions and there’s no way that the lawyer can be
clear that he’s getting the full story from all the officers. However, the underwriters do require an
independent opinion concerning the truthfulness of the prospectus. “Based on what we know (without a full audit
or full investigation), nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to
believe that the prospectus is truthful in all material respects.” The next sentence will say: “The preceding
sentence does not relate to the financial statements.” In the real world, there is a lot of overlap
between the narrative and financial statement portions of the prospectus, and
one of the big issues is whether there was an overlap in the case we talked
about.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about the law firm’s liability to the client? Their opinion is limited and there is
probably no possibly of liability. But
lawyers <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> be held liable. One of the big law firms in <st1:City><st1:place>Dallas</st1:place></st1:City>,
out of tax shelter advice, settled in the amount of their malpractice policy,
$75 million, based on their recommendation of bogus tax shelters.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:3;tab-stops:45.0pt'><a
name="_Toc76297542"><b>Comfort letters</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>One more thing about deals, registered and unregistered: as
to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unaudited interim </i>statements
(CPAs only audit annual statements), you can get a “comfort letter” from the
CPA firm. The purchaser will require
such a “comfort letter” concerning the unaudited statements. It reads much like the attorney’s negative
opinion: “We have not conducted an audit or a complete investigation. This is supplied to you alone; nobody else
may rely on it. The opinion may not be
assigned or transferred and it applies only to this deal.” Lawyers in practice refer to this as dealing
with the “sister-in-law problem”. Say
you’re asked for a big opinion for a client. Suppose the guy gets the opinion and the sister-in-law has a similar
problem, and the guy copies the letter for her, but it doesn’t fit her
situation. If you don’t have that
clause, it’s possible that the sister-in-law can sue you.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>They will also state: “We have conducted certain limited
inquiries concerning the unaudited statement. To the best of our knowledge, in our opinion [to prevent a warranty or
contract], based on what we know, the interim statements contain no material
untrue matter <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> they are consistent
with the bases on which the audited statements were prepared.”</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Comfort letters are useful for three reasons: (1) The
letters come with a prestigious letterhead. (2) The accountants take this seriously, even though they don’t
audit. (3) You probably trigger R.2d
Torts § 552 because the auditing firm is on notice of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>special foreseeability</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are instances in which it would be wise to get audited
statements for the six month period if you’re really suspicious. But it will take a while a cost a lot of
money. It costs almost as much to certify
a six month period as it does to certify a twelve month period.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Under <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
law, § 552 is not followed. <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> law is unique: this process hooks you up to a
negligence standard against a CPA firm, whereas if you don’t do it, you’ll have
to prove <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gross</i> negligence in order to
sue that firm. The comfort letter
establishes privity, or, as the Court of Appeals of <st1:State><st1:place>New

<p style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc76297543"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Connecting the ’33 and ’34 Acts</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In general, the Securities Act of 1933 deals with offerings
by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>issuers</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>affiliates of issuers</i> that are public nature. If an offering is private, 4(1), 4(2) and
Rule 506 will usually exempt them. The
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 deals primarily with the day-to-day <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>trading markets</i>, both the stock
exchanges (NYSE, AMEX) and the over-the-counter markets (NASDAQ).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you’re a big public company, there is nothing that will
exempt you from registration, but you’ll get shorter forms under the Securities
Act of 1933. Be aware of these two
forms: under the ’33 Act, you use S-1 if you can’t find a simpler form. We have talked about the S-8, which is a simpler
form for employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans. The S-8 can only be used by public reporting
companies.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, at § 12 we find talk
of registration of securities, too. The
big form you use, either with a stock exchange or with NASD is Form 10 under
the ’34 Act. In addition, you will have
to file a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>listing application </i>and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>signed listing agreement </i>with the stock
exchange or NASD. If you’re a new
company, going public, you usually will list on an exchange or on NASDAQ at the
same time that you have your ’33 Act statement approved. But you don’t have to say the same thing
three different times. Once your S-1 is
effective, you just fill out the first couple of pages of the Form 10 and
listing application and then attach your ’33 Act statement to it. Then you incorporate by reference. This information is publicly available in <st1:State><st1:place>Washington</st1:place></st1:State>. You can go and look at the paper or you can
look it up on EDGAR.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>At § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, fraud is
prohibited in connection with the purchase or sale of any security by any
person. It covers everything! It’s not often useful to plaintiffs due to
the restrictions of the ’95 Act and the fact that you always have to plead
scienter with great particularity. However, the last two U.S. Supreme Court cases on the subject have
turned out to be very pro-plaintiff. American investors bought warrants in a <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>
company that also did business in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>. They went to exercise the warrants, but they
were refused. They sued the <st1:place>Hong
 Kong</st1:place> company in federal court in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>. They proved to the district judge that the <st1:place>Hong
 Kong</st1:place> company had intended to squelch their efforts at exercising
from the beginning. The case went to the
Supreme Court: was this a proper use of 10b-5? The Rule requires that only a purchaser or seller of securities can
sue. But the options were clearly
securities. The Supreme Court held that
if they had the actual specific intent to screw them over from the beginning,
then that’s fraud!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>§ 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relates to
any tender offer by any person for any security. If you make a tender offer to a little
company and you use the mails or means of interstate commerce, you’re
covered. But § 14(e) does not
specifically require the use of the mails or interstate commerce. If you’re using it affirmatively, it’s
usually present, so plead it and prove it. The Supreme Court has held that where the statute doesn’t require an
interstate commerce connection but the plaintiff proves it, you’re okay.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Compare §§ 12(a)-(b) and 12(g). §§ 12(a)-(b) are voluntary because no one is
required to list their securities on a stock exchange. § 12 (g) is mainly mandatory in that if you have
over 500 shareholders and over a certain amount of money in assets, you must
file. § 12 (g) also permits voluntary
filing. Why would anyone want to do
that, though? The answer comes from the
Williams Act. The big deal is §§
13(a)-(b): public periodic reporting with the SEC is required. Once you go public and list on the NYSE,
you’ll be filing reports thereafter. Under §§ 14(a)-(c), you have proxies. Under § 16, you have insider trading reports. § 16(b) has to do with recapture of
short-swing profits. § 16(c) deals with
an officer, director, or 10% shareholder and says that a short sale is a
crime. A short sale is a sale of stock
you don’t own. You sell short when you
think the stock is going down. In the
1920’s, the CEO of a company sold his stock short and made a mint! This was deemed “un-American”! Also, you can’t sell “against the box”,
meaning borrowing it from your own stock certificates in your safe deposit box. You have to actually transfer the certificate
when you sell the stock!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Williams Act, §§ 13(d)-(e) and 14(d)-(e), deals with
control share acquisitions and tender offers. §§ 14(d) and 13(d) are restricted to § 12 companies. But there’s an oddity: § 14(e) and the
regulations thereunder apply to tender offers for any security, whether
registered or not. For a private
company, go to the regulations for § 14(e) and Rule 10b-13. For a public company, go to § 14(d) and
regulations plus § 14(e) and regulations plus Rule 10b-13. Most regulation of tender offers today is
under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>state</i> law but the federal law
is important, too.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two other ways you can become subject to §
13. If you’re a public utility holding
company or an investment company, those statutes incorporate the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 provisions. Under §
15(d) and regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, if you file an
effective Securities Act of 1933 statement, you become subject to § 13. Now go to 15c-(2)(11), which says that the
SEC has power by regulations to govern quotations for securities on a stock
exchange or the over-the-counter market. Rule 15c-(2)(11) is mind-boggling, but it has a simple purpose: before
this Rule, if you were a securities broker-dealer and you wanted to enter into
the NASD quotation system, you could do it for quotations for a company not
subject to § 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Rule reverses this: no broker-dealer will
enter quotations for a company not subject to § 13 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 into a quotation system. There is one exception, which is if a broker-dealer, on his own, gathers
material substantially similar to what would be in the SEC file for a § 13
company, in which case the broker-dealer can enter quotations. This would be easy for an insurance company
because, for 100 years, state law has required insurance companies to maintain
mountains of public periodic information at the state capitol. It’s difficult aside from insurance companies
to do this.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>Hypothetical on §
12(g)</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There is no conflict of interest. We never represented the person before
today. She should clear it with her
boss. She’s the COO, and she must work
for a CEO and the board of directors. Recall the Bernie Ebbers problem. Bernie found out that a guy was selling stock without his
permission. He took him out to eat, and
when they got back, his office had been cleared out. Consider Rule 10b-5 and R.C. 1707.44: if you
sell securities of an insolvent person and the other side doesn’t know of the
insolvency, that’s a crime under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law. But the company is solvent in this
case. Also, consider the effect of Rule
10b-5 on insider trading. If there is
undisclosed, unfavorable information about the company, the COO can’t trade. It would be a crime, with the possible
exception of a new Rule, but the effect of the Rule isn’t clear. Shipman thinks that there is no problem under
these facts.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Would a § 13(d) report have to be filed? She owns far less than 5% of the shares
outstanding. Why do we raise this
issue? The rules under § 13(d) deal with
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>beneficial ownership</i>. Probably no problem there. A § 16(a) report would be due under
Sarbanes-Oxley. It must be done
electronically within two or three days. This won’t be a problem because most bigger companies have people either
in the corporate secretary’s office or general counsel’s office who are
equipped to make these filings for her, and with advance consultation with
those people she could get them to file the report on her behalf. If she happened to be out of town on the day
that it’s due, she could give those people a signed, written power of attorney
to file the reports. If you’re over 5%,
there will be both a § 13(d) report and a separate § 16(a) report. What’s the theory behind the two
sections? Under § 16(a), the market pays
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tremendous attention </i>to what the
insiders are doing. Under § 13(d), it’s
an early warning system of a possible <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>takeover
bid</i>. If you’re over 5%, whether or
not you’re an officer, director, or 10% holder, you’ll have to report. We don’t think there’s a problem under § 16(a). Corporate insiders hate this, but the system
works pretty well according to Shipman.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>§ 16(b) says that if the client or people within her
beneficial ownership range purchase and sell within a six-month period or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sell and purchase</i> within a six month
period, then any shareholder can bring a suit and recapture the
difference. Even if she is pure as the
driven snow, it’s no defense. What’s
“sale and purchase”? Let’s say that
looking back six months over her beneficial ownership range (that is, your
family, trusts and other close people). We look backwards first and see if she or anyone in her beneficial
ownership range has made a purchase in the past six months. If it was more than six months, we look
forward. It makes sense that if she buys
stock for $10 and sells for $70, it’s clear she’ll be hit with $60 per share
recapture. But if she sells for $70 and
then purchases for $40, $30 per share will be recaptured. We have to warn her about the future!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Next up, we go over Rule 144, which <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>never applies</i> to a company that is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>never public</i>. This Rule is
very favorable to public companies and their insiders and those buying in
exempt transactions from insiders. Our
client is under Rule 144 even if all the stock she bought was option stock or
stock she bought through a broker on the securities market because she is an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>affiliate</i> as defined in Rule 405. We make a checklist for the company: are they
current in their § 13 filing? If not, we
can’t use the Rule. Next, we compute her
beneficial ownership (including ownership by her husband and kids and live-in
mother/mother-in-law, family trust, partnership and charitable organizations
that she runs). We look at those
people’s transactions and see if this proposed transaction, coupled with others,
will pass the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>volume limit test</i>. We explain that it must be a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>brokers’</i> transaction. Next, if she has acquired any security in an
exempt transaction from the issuer, there will be a holding period of one year
that will attach. In addition, any securities
of that nature that she has will have a legend on them, and she’ll have to go
to the transfer agent and get securities without a legend because legended
delivery is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se</i> bad delivery. It must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>squeaky clean!</i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>She will have to timely file a Form 144. If she was over 5%, she would have to do
three different filings! In practice,
half of the transactions have to be unwound, but people screw it up. You’ll be dealing with a local office of the
brokerage house. When the Form 144 hits <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>after</i> the transaction, the <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> compliance director will say the form is not
right and you have to cancel it and do it over. How do we avoid this? You can
file the form a week or so before the transaction, get the local brokerage
house guy and the <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> compliance
director to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> sign off by fax
before you actually sell. In the real
world, studies have shown that only half of the letters of credit transactions
go through. That’s part of why American
Express makes money off of travelers’ checks.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The company may have filed a stop transfer order with the
transfer agent because she’s a #2 officer. How do we deal with this in advance? The transfer agent will usually accept the written opinion of internal
counsel that it’s okay. Get that file in
advance with the transfer agent. That
will eliminate the stop transfer order. The internal counsel will usually request the opinion of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>personal</i> lawyer for the officer or
director and we can give it. Lastly, the
brokerage house that she has got her to fill out a questionnaire, with one
question being: “Are you the officer or director of a public company?” Many brokerage houses also require the
opinion of the internal counsel for the company and again, on that opinion, the
internal counsel will usually require our opinion as a condition
precedent. It is a bit complicated, and
there is a lot of paperwork.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>She should pick a specific certificate with a high tax
basis. She should use specific
identification. For § 16(b) purposes,
you cannot specifically identify. A
court will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pick</i> the stock with the
lowest basis. Probably all of her stock
has a basis lower than $70 per share. A
lot of it is probably option stock for which she may have paid $20 or $30 per
share. You will have to go over the tax
effects with a tax attorney.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Make sure to get reasonable diversification of
investments! If all our client’s wealth
is in her house and this stock, she would be well advised to sell some of the
stock and diversify her portfolio a bit. At Enron, there were mid-level executives in just this situation,
holding millions of dollars in Enron stock on January 1 of the year. By the end of the year, the stock was worth
$0.10 per share rather than $70 or $80. The company looks very good and she seems to have been there a long time. On the other hand, if all she has is the
house and this, she has lumped all her eggs in one basket. But on the other, other hand, if you take out
a second mortgage you can deduct the interest for federal income tax purposes.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc76297544"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Covenant to register</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Especially in big Rule 506 transactions, there will be a
covenant to register. For example,
venture capitalists come in and advance money under Rule 506 for stock. They usually won’t do it unless they think
the company will have a chance of going public down the road. They will require a covenant to register the
stock that they purchased under certain conditions. Usually, there is not one, but two or three
rounds of venture capital financing before a company can go public. The contract to register is a valid
contract. Note this practical
limitation: if you’re a venture capital outfit and you’re investing in a
company and the contract to register is conditioned on the company “turning the
corner” and starting to make money, you still have to find an investment banker
interested in such transactions.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In addition, if it is agreed that the company will go
public, the underwriters will not let the venture capitalists sell over
one-half. This is a matter of
merchandising. If the venture
capitalists want to sell more than that, it looks like a bailout and the
offering won’t take. The underwriter
will require signatures for a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lock-up
period</i>, usually nine months, from the venture capital types and the twenty
top employees holding the most options. One of the prospectus items will be the Rule 144 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>overhang</i>. The underwriter
wants nine months during which the insiders will not cash in. At the end of nine months, when Rule 144 will
be fully effective as to people who have held the stock for a year or more and
as to non-executives who want to sell, the market price of the stock will go
down an average of 8%. It’s a risky
business to take a company public, but it can also make you a lot of
money! Underwriting fees can approach
6%. There are also attorneys’ fees and auditors’
fees that will run the total cost up to 9%.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>None of Regulation D itself deals with affiliates. Also, if a company is public, Rule 144 has a
volume limit. Say you have a situation
where Smith owns 80% of X, Inc., a closely held company. GM or some other big company comes along and
wants to buy X, either for cash or stock (which would be tax-free). Can Smith, an affiliate, sell to GM? Smith can’t use Rule 144 because, among other
things, Rule 144 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i> applies to a
company that is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i> public. He can’t use § 4(2) because that is limited
to the actual <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>issuer</i>. Smith can use § 4(1) plus § 2(11): when you
put them together, the controlling person can, in this situation, sell to GM so
long as it is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-distribution</i>. The first sentence of § 2(11) talks about
distribution. If something is a
non-distribution, then when you put § 2(11) together with § 4(1), you have an
exemption. This will be a
non-distribution if Smith meets the test of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ralston
Purina</i>: (1) there is full and fair disclosure up front, (2) the purchaser
can fend for himself, (3) the stock is legended and there is an investment
letter, and (4) GM is given <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>access</i> to
Smith and all top executives. So, there <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does</i> exist a § 4(1) exemption under this
situation. It’s a bit trickier than
using Rule 506, but if you’re careful it can be done.</p>

  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stoneham</i></st1:place></st1:City> – <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>
owned the majority stock of the New York Giants, and McGraw was his manager in
the 1920’s. McGraw was also a minority
shareholder in the Giants corporation. These two basically ran the team and the business. There were about 7-8 other minority
shareholders. McQuade, a state court
judge, somehow got to know McGraw and <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>. McGraw and <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>
asked McQuade to buy some stock in the corporation to the tune of around
$100,000. They invited him to be an
officer of the company. <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>
didn’t call a corporate lawyer! McQuade
negotiated with McGraw and <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>
and entered into a contract with him in their personal capacities. First off, there was a shareholder voting
agreement for a short term whereby the two sellers agreed to vote their stock
to elect <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City> as a
director. The agreement was in writing
and was short-term. It was signed. There was no bad intent, and all courts
upheld this first, limited shareholders’ voting agreement. Shareholder voting agreements that are
limited, reasonable, in writing and signed can be valid even if they don’t meet
the standards of R.C. 1701.591 because the courts encourage such
agreements. In the second agreement, <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>
and McGraw, as directors, agreed that they would keep McQuade as an officer of
the corporation for a reasonable length of years.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The stock changed hands. McQuade paid the money and took over as treasurer. He performed well. One day, <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>
called him in and said: “You’re fired!” McQuade sues. The first count is
that he wants an injunction for reinstatement. The second count is that if he can’t get reinstatement, he wants
monetary damages. The trial court did
not grant reinstatement. The trial court
thought that the agreement was valid, but in those days you couldn’t get
affirmative injunctive relief to keep a job because the feeling was that you
always had a damage remedy that was adequate at law. That’s a correct statement of the law as of
1921.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But the exceptions have grown. The first exception is found in civil service
statutes: if you have a civil service protection with government and you are
wrongfully removed without cause, you can go into court and get an affirmative
injunctive order for reinstatement. The
second exception comes in the 1930’s with federal labor legislation: if you
were fired in violation of the union contract or federal labor laws, you, or
the union on your behalf, could go into court and get affirmative injunctive
relief for a wrongful discharge. The
third exception was tenure in educational institutions, which has grown over
the last ninety years. If you have
tenure and are dismissed, you can go to court and get reinstated. The fourth exception is found in state and
federal equal employment statutes from the 1960’s and 1970’s. You can sue for reinstatement. Most plaintiffs will opt for money damages,
though, because you don’t want to go back to a job where they don’t want
you. The fifth exception is that if
you’re wrongfully dismissed from state employment in violation of state union
laws, you and your union can get you reinstated. But people will often choose damages instead.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Lastly, there are two “new kids on the block”. Arbitrators can grant remedies that courts
cannot unless the arbitration agreement states to the contrary. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Staklinski</i>,
from the Court of Appeals of <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>,
a close corporation formed an agreement with a top executive for employment for
a term. The agreement was in writing and
signed. After a year or two, the company
thought the employee had a disability such that he couldn’t perform and that
therefore their performance in paying money to him was excused. He disagreed about being disabled and he
wanted his job back. The case goes to
arbitration, where the arbitrator finds that (1) he is not disabled though he
does have some health problems, and (2) an affirmative order is entered that he
must be reinstated. This goes all the
way to the Court of Appeals of <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>,
a majority of which held that arbitrators can issue orders that courts cannot
unless the arbitration agreement states to the contrary. If you don’t want an arbitration agreement to
go that far, the magic language is: “The arbitrator shall strictly stick to the
law.” The cases have gone even further
than this case.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gigax</i> case
from the Court of Appeals in <st1:City><st1:place>Dayton</st1:place></st1:City>,
arising from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i>, we learn
that there is an intense fiduciary duty in close corporations that can be
enforced different ways. Four people
formed a company, contributing equal amounts of money and each one being a
director. For a long time, everyone got
along fine. There were no employment
contracts for a term. There were no R.C.
1701.591 agreements. But one day, three
of the directors ganged up on Gigax and gave him the pink slip. The case had two holdings: (1) applying <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i> to the facts of this
case, there were no grounds for discharge for cause, and (2) though Gigax
wasn’t too smart, he was doing a reasonably good job, and when you have a close
corporation with no financial stringency and no grounds for discharge for
cause, the three can’t call in the fourth one and dismiss him. The court entered an order of reinstatement
for Gigax. Then one of the judges said
that there was another branch to the case. The line of cases stemming from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mers
v. Dispatch</i> dealt with improper discharge. Later there was a case with a bunch of physicians who formed a
corporation. There were no employment
contracts. There was an agreement up
front that if a majority of the board of directors wanted to terminate one of
the doctors as an employee they could do it. The Court of Appeals in <st1:City><st1:place>Dayton</st1:place></st1:City>
held that this was not contrary to the holding of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Gigax</i>.</p>

<p>Two opinions from Minnesota in the 1970’s in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pedro v. Pedro</i> dealt with a company that
had been run by Pedros for generations without an employment contract or
.591-type agreement. One day, one of the
Pedros was fired without cause. The
Minnesota Supreme Court held that because the company had a tradition of jobs
for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> qualified Pedros, he could
collect. </p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Keep in mind that the trial court held that both parts of
the agreement in the present case were valid, but they couldn’t grant
reinstatement. This is correct for 1921,
though these exceptions have been created since then. McQuade had done a good job, and he was not
fired for cause. The part of the
agreement that purported to bind the two people <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>qua</i> directors was not okay, and was contrary to public policy. It was contrary to corporate norms, and hence
unenforceable. Note that McQuade got
screwed! He paid out all this money for
minority stock. They kicked him out and
took his money! The court also alluded
to the fact that McQuade was a public official and he violated <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> law by negotiating for a private position while
on the pubic payroll. The rest of the
cases follow from this one.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>How far could McQuade have gone with an enforceable contract
under <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> law? With whom would he have had to
negotiate? The voting agreement is okay,
but we’re talking about a position with the company. He would have to negotiate with the other
board members, who hire and fire officers and other top executives. The <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
statute provided that the board would elect officers once a year. McQuade could have gone to the full board and
gotten a position for a certain number of years as a high executive employee
with board approval. Such a contract
will go on to say: “Employee agrees to serve as an officer and/or a director,
if elected, without any further compensation.” In other words, his compensation package would be spelled out for this
particular job. That’s as far as he
could have gone in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> in
1921. But what about in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
in 2004? What else could he have done,
and how, under R.C. 1701.591? Could he
have gotten a five-year contract as treasurer under .591? What do you have to do to get such an
agreement? You need the concurrence of
both the directors and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> the
shareholders (including <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-voting </i>shareholders). You have to meet the technical requirements
of the statute.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Say McQuade <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>had</i>
entered into a five year contract, the board approved it, and it’s in
writing. Could he then be dismissed <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>with</i> cause? The answer is that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>of course</i> he can. But could
he be dismissed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>without</i> cause? If McQuade had an agency coupled with an
interest and the contract stated that it was irrevocable, this makes for a
tenth exception. McQuade bought stock,
though he didn’t buy it from the corporation. If he had bought the stock <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>from</i>
the corporation, it would have been an agency coupled with an interest and if
there was an irrevocability clause, it would have been irrevocable. After World War II, statutes in both <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> and <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
have modified the common law rule as to proxies. Very often in a close corporation there will
be a shareholders’ voting agreement and a proxy given. Is that a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>proxy
</i>coupled with an interest under agency law? At common law, it’s not clear, but by statute in both <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> and <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
the answer is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>yes</i>. Furthermore, in <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State>, if it’s in connection with a valid employment
contract, it is coupled with an interest. Keep in mind that the common law rule is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>strict</i>, but consider one of the examples given by R.2d Agency: a
company is having financial problems. Smith buys stock from them and at the same time takes an executive
position. He cannot be dismissed without
cause because this is an agency coupled with an interest and is thus
irrevocable. But if the contract <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>waives</i> that protection, the waiver is
valid most of the time.</p>

<p><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Clark</i></st1:place><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Dodge</i> – Here we have sweat equity
with a secret process meeting a capitalist with a lot of money. A corporation is formed and the capitalist is
to contribute a lot of money and get 75% of the stock. Sweat equity is to turn over the secret
process and get the remaining 25% of the stock. There is a close corporation agreement between the two of them. It is limited and carefully drafted. It is limited to the lifetime of the two
individuals and it says that sweat equity will be retained as a corporate
officer as long as his work is adequate. The salary specified is reasonable. The company is formed, and after a while, the capitalist uses his 75%
stock interest to take over the board and cause the board to fire sweat
equity. Sweat equity sues for specific
performance. The trial court says that
based on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McQuade v. Stoneham</i>, the
contract violates <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>corporate norms</i>. The Court of Appeals of New York disagrees,
saying that because 100% of the shareholders had signed, the infringement of
the corporate norms were minor, the creditors weren’t hurt, and the employment
arrangement for sweat equity was only so long as he did a good job. They remand to the trial court, where it was
found that sweat equity had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>
turned over the secret process. Sweat
equity is booted out of court for having unclean hands!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Galler v. Galler</i> –
We have two brothers with about 46% stock holdings each and 8% to a minority
shareholder who was a high executive employee. The brothers did some tax planning together and entered into an
agreement as to what would happen after the first brother died. There were provisions as to voting of the
stock and there were also provisions on payments to the widow of the deceased
brother. Those payments were limited,
creditors weren’t hurt because of the limits, and in addition, the payments
could only be made if they were income tax deductible. So the first brother dies and the widow of
the second brother sues for specific enforcement. There are three different sets of litigation. There is no close corporation statute in <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
at the time of the litigation. This is
solely a common law matter. When all is
said and done, the result is: (1) the agreement was for a reasonable length,
that is, the agreement was going to terminate on the death of the widow of the
first brother to die, (2) the purpose was reasonable, (3) the agreement was in
a signed writing, (4) nothing in the agreement hurt creditors because it was so
limited, and (5) the court was impressed with the fact that the widow’s pension
was not large and that it would cease if the amounts proved not to be
tax-deductible.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What’s the difference between this case and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Clark v. Dodge</i>? The difference is that we had one non-signing
shareholder: the 8% minority holder. The
court wants to hold for the widow, and they hold that the minority shareholder
didn’t object and that he wasn’t really hurt. Therefore, the agreement was upheld. The litigation was long and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vicious</i>.</p>

shareholders’ agreement between them that was signed, written, with a proper
purpose, not unreasonable in length, and without harm to creditors. But under <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law, a close corporation agreement is valid <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only
if</i>, among other others, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charter</i>
of the company is amended to put in the charter that it is a close
corporation. <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
has a number of technical requirements, but it doesn’t have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>this one</i>. The majority opinion was that this was a mere
technical deviation that did not hurt the company or the other shareholder, and
thus that the court would enforce it. The dissent says that a rule is a rule and a requirement is a
requirement, and that the parties should have dotted their t’s and crossed
their i’s, so the agreement shouldn’t be enforced.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Matter of Auer v.
Dressel</i> – Here we get <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>wild!</i> We have a small, public <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> corporation. Under <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> law, the
board of directors is to elect the president annually. Note that the way to avoid conflict with
those requirements is to have a contract for five or ten years to be a high
executive employee and to serve as an officer or director, if elected, at no
additional compensation. Here, there was
no contract. The president was elected
and was very popular with a group of minority shareholders. But he got on the outs with the board of
directors. Under <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> statute as well as <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statute, the president could be removed with or without cause. (This is found in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
at R.C. 1701.61-.66: the statute says that it’s not going to affect any
contract that he had.) The minority
shareholders call a meeting. All state
statutes provide that if a certain percentage of shareholders get together and
sign a call and file it with the secretary, the board must call a meeting. <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
has this statute at R.C. 1701.37-.59. It’s a very populist statute! Be
warned: if it’s a public company, gathering the signatures together will
constitute the solicitation of a proxy under 1701.14. If you only do ten or fewer, there is an
exemption, but otherwise you must file a statement with the SEC. The controlling case is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Studebacker</i>, from the Second Circuit in the 1950’s. The second problem is that the board is going
to resist this. How do you react? Under FRCP Rule 65, you file for a TRO. If you prove that you’ve filed the correct
signatures, the court will issue a mandatory injunction forcing the board to
call the meeting.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What were the purposes of the meeting in the call? It was to remove the directors for
cause. Under <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> law, there was no common law right as of that
time to remove directors without cause unless the charter so provided. Most states in the last fifty years have
turned this around. But it was held that
there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> a common law right to remove
directors for cause. Was removing the
president for cause something that created the right to remove the directors
for cause? The <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> court says this should be reviewed <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>after</i> the meeting. In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
the courts will consider this question <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>up
front</i>. You can’t use proxies to
remove directors for cause. Proxies are
used for all kinds of purposes by shareholders!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The dissident shareholders wanted to put before all the
shareholders assembled at the meeting a resolution that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>seems</i> to read like an order for the board to reinstate the deposed,
loved president. The court is shifty and
subtle! They admit that in <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State>, the board has the authority to elect and remove
officers. Therefore, under <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McQude</i>, a shareholder resolution
ordering the board to reinstate the guy would be void. If it were an order, the court would strike
it down. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>However</i>, they construe the language of the resolution as being <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>precatory</i>: a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>request</i> of the shareholders assembled to reinstate the
president. The court says that precatory
resolutions to the board as to corporate business are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>fair game</i> even if it would be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unfair</i>
if that resolution were mandatory. Why
is this important? Under SEC Rule
14(a)(8), shareholders are allowed to put in, at company expense, certain
shareholder resolutions. Management
hates these!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In many instances, the shareholders cannot put in mandatory
resolutions, but in many of those instances where they can, they can change the
language to: “We respectfully request the board to do such and so” and be able
to put it in. Be cautioned that (1) in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
because shareholders have the power to amend the regulations and articles,
there are times shareholders <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> put
in mandatory resolutions at meetings. (2) The statute on call of meetings has been amended recently to
increase the percentage required. If
it’s a public company, you’ll have to file an SEC proxy statement to get a
certain percentage. (3) In Ohio, R.C.
1701.58, dealing with removal of directors without cause, has been extensively
amended in the last five years to say that if the board is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>classified</i> (think of the U.S. Senate: 1/3 elected every two years),
you can’t remove without cause. This was
put in by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anti-takeover</i> forces. Most takeover bids in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
deal with getting control of the board of directors of the target. <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
is one of the few states where the shareholders can amend the articles to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>increase</i> the number of directors and to
fill the vacancies. A contested takeover
bid for a public company in Ohio will typically involve the call of a meeting
to increase the board from 9 to 35 (management has the advantage of cumulative
voting in most Ohio companies and will elect some of the 26 additional
directors). The amendment to R.C.
1701.58 a few years ago is largely meaningless in the context of a hostile
tender offer in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. The <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
amendment was patterned after <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
where the amendment actually means something because shareholders, acting
alone, cannot amend the articles or regulations. Hostile takeovers are hot stuff! We’ve just scratched the surface!</p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297550"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Cognovit clauses</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>These start out in 1960. They are also known as “confession of judgment” clauses. What are they? In around 15 states, these clauses were
routine both in consumer and commercial transactions. In <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>,
<st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> and most American
states, they were quickly ruled against public policy. Near the end of a contract, it would say: “I,
the maker, do hereby appoint any licensed attorney in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
to confess judgment in full on this note at any time on my behalf. This authority is irrevocable and we declare
it is an agency coupled with an interest.” In the old days, trial lawyers would simply go down to the courthouse
and find people who they litigated against with a stack of notes and have the
other guy sign them. The other guy would
do the same for you. This is an odious
practice, according to Shipman.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the 1970’s, the U.S. Supreme Court took up two cases in
the 1970’s under the Fourteenth Amendment related to cognovit clauses. In the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
case that reached the Supreme Court, the cognovit clause was in a commercial contract
between two businessmen each separately represented by independent
lawyers. Evidence was also presented to
the Court that the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> practice
was that one the cognovit judgment had been entered, if the maker had a good
defense, then he could usually move for a new trial and move to set aside the
cognovit judgment. Once you get that
judgment, you can get a writ of execution and levy on whatever that guy
has. The Supreme Court ruled in two
cases that, at least in a commercial transaction between sophisticated people,
the practice <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does not</i> violate the
Fourteenth Amendment. After the two
cases came an FTC rule outlawing cognovit clauses in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>consumer paper</i>. An <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statute did two things: (1) it outlawed the clauses as to consumer paper,
similar to the FTC rule, and (2) it set out a full-caps legend that must be
typed verbatim into the note.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>These clauses are widely used in commercial transactions in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. Why is this agency law? It’s an agency coupled with an interest; note
the drafting. What if Mr. Smith goes
crazy after signing the commercial cognovit note? Under standard agency rules, insanity
automatically terminates any power of attorney or any agency. However, the courts have held that if you
have a cognovit note stated to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest then
that rule will not apply. If Mr. Smith
gives a cognivit note in a commercial transaction to Huntington Bank and then
goes insane, Huntington Bank can still use it against him. But what if Mr. Smith dies? The standard agency rule is that the death of
a principal terminates agency even if neither agent nor third party knows of
the death. There is an old U.S. Supreme
Court case written by Chief Justice Marshall so holding. Most states follow that, even as to cognovit
notes. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Cognovit notes have two big
problems: (1) the death problem, and (2) the lawyer for the creditor can’t sign
it; you must find someone who is not a lawyer for the debtor <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>or</i> the creditor. It’s very difficult to get people to sign it
because it’s too much of a grey area.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> and
the states where cognovit notes are used, people put <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>too much trust</i> in them as a good security device. In other words, if you’re a small supplier
asked to supply 100,000 units to a small manufacturer, unsecured, you can use
the cognovit note, but you should keep in mind that institutional creditors
such as banks and insurance companies are ahead of you with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>recorded first mortgages</i>. The cognovit clause will help you collect a
little bit, but not a lot. On the other
hand, if you’re a debtor with a lot of power, don’t agree with the cognovit
clause! The judgment can get on the
record in two hours, but it can take two years to get out of it! The problem is that it is very difficult for
debtors or lessees to avoid the cognovit clauses in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. All creditors’ and lessors’ lawyers have them
on their forms.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>One more bit about agency: the problems that have talked
about death and insanity revoking powers of attorney have caused problems for a
long time. In World War II, nearly every
state enacted a “Servicemen’s Statute”, providing that if you were a
serviceman, you executed a power of attorney before you went to fight overseas,
you told your spouse to sell Greenacre, your spouse negotiated with Mr. X to
sell Greenacre, and a contract was signed, then if neither the spouse nor Mr. X
knew that the serviceman had been killed before the contract was signed, the
contract would still be binding. At
common law, before these statutes, that was not the result; the contract would
not have been binding. On big deals,
then and now, the third party dealing with the serviceman will insist that the
serviceperson transfer to a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>revocable
trust</i> with a bank as trustee, since even today you can avoid a lot of these
problems.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Thirty years ago, a “new kid” arrived on the block. By statute in all states, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>durable power of attorney</i> say that if
someone in a signed, dated power of attorney writing states that “if I lose my
legal capacity to act for myself, then Ms. X is my agent for all of the
following matters”. The power of
attorney can be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>springing</i>. So long as the person is in their right mind,
Ms. X has no power. On the other hand,
the power of attorney can be by a fully competent person. They can have their lawyer draft a durable
power of attorney for Ms. X while he’s fully in his right mind. So long as the principal retains his sanity,
the power of attorney can be revoked by him. If he loses his sanity, and thus he himself cannot revoke, how can it be
revoked? It can be revoked through a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>proceeding for the guardianship of the
person and the property</i> in the probate court brought by the relatives of
the principal. Suppose the daughters
don’t like Ms. X and think that she’s not taking care of him well and
squandering his money. They can go into
the probate court and ask that, for example, the eldest daughter be appointed
guardian of the person and of the property. That appointment will cut off Ms. X’s powers. Note that the durable power of attorney will
not give Ms. X the power to commit the subject to a nuthouse. She would have to go through very formal
procedures at the probate court. The
court would have to appoint an attorney for the man to determine if he’s a nut.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The newer kids on the block are the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>living will</i> (by statute in the last twenty years) and the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>health care power of attorney</i>. You can go to a lawyer and have drafted a
health care power of attorney appointing certain people to have your health
care power of attorney if you are unable to work with the doctors in the
hospital. But note that so far as the
property is concerned, the “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>old</i> kid
on the block”, the revocable trust is often the best available choice. The old man can revoke that trust at any time
while he’s competent and get control of the property back. Also, the bank can never be appointed the
guardian of the person; it can only be the guardian of the property. The proceedings in the probate court are
public, and most families hate to deal with it. Finally, as an attorney involved in such matters, keep in mind that you
should tell the person under a power of attorney to account annually to the
children and spouse and get them to approve. Note also that the Code of Professional Responsibility gets tricky if a
lawyer acts in these capacities.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gottfried v. Gottfried
</i>– When minority shareholders sue the company to force a dividend, the
business judgment rule will apply. You’ll have to show gross negligence, bad faith, or fraud. In this case, the minority didn’t get along
with the majority, but the court pointed out that the directors had redeemed a
lot of preferred stock and that actually a good bit of money had come out of
the company and that the business judgment shield was not shredded. Tax-wise, these transactions are covered by
Internal Revenue Code §§ 301-302 and 306. Within the past two years, many types of dividends of a Sub C company
are taxed with only half of the amount being included in gross income. It is a partial relief of the double tax and
it is crucial. Where stock is redeemed,
the transaction may be a capital gains transaction or it may be a dividend
transaction.</p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Donahue v. Rodd
Electrotype Co.</i> – The <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>
line of cases as to close corporations is followed in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
by a state court of appeals case from the 1980’s called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Estate of Schroer v. Stamco Supply, Inc</i>. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Donahue</i>,
an old man is the president and CEO and has the controlling stock interest in a
corporation. He shows no signs of
retiring. In business school parlance,
there is no succession plan. He just
keeps on going because he has a good salary. The company has never paid dividends. The biggest minority shareholders are his sons. A smaller minority shareholder is the husband
of the plaintiff, who worked for the company and died before judgment. The sons are anxious for a succession
plan. They want to get the person out
and they come up with what, to them, is an extremely logical plan: the
corporation should repurchase the shares. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, this is governed
by R.C. 1701.11-.37. The <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statute is more restrictive on repurchases than many states. There <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are</i>
instances where you need a shareholder’s vote in order to do it, but there are
other instances where you do not need it. Here, there was no fraud, no allegation of an unreasonable price and no
allegation that the company lacked the surplus or was rendered insolvent. It’s a pretty clean case!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The minority employee, and later his widow, argued that
either the transaction with the old man ought to be rescinded, or the same
offer should be made to the widow. It’s
an equal protection argument under the guise of fiduciary duties. On these facts, the <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>
court analyzes the position of a minority shareholder in a close
corporation. It can be pretty grim money
wise. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>controlling</i> shareholders are likely to get the good jobs and pay
themselves decent salaries, meaning they have no need for dividends. The minority shareholders get no dividends,
and if they attempt to sell their stock, they will find that it’s hard to
sell. When you have stock in a big
publicly traded corporation, you can buy and sell a small amount of stock. If the majority shareholders can show a
legitimate business purpose for what they did, we will let them do it without
giving the minority shareholders a remedy. In a famous footnote, another exception is provided. If the articles of incorporation or bylaws
(regulations) do not provide to the contrary or if 100% of the shareholders
consent and there is no danger to creditors, then we will go along with
it. What does it all mean?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>paradigm
hypothetical</i>. Father is asked to
invest in the stock of a company where his daughter is the majority
shareholder. Suppose that’s his only
child, he’s not married, and he can afford it, but he wants his money back in five
years. How will his attorney set it
up? He’ll buy the stock with a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>redemption agreement </i>whereby the company
agrees to redeem the stock at fair market value in five years. Fair market value will be defined as fair
market value <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>without minority discount</i>. That is, they will value all the shares and
spread the value among them. But that’s
not enough! Father’s lawyer will have to
include a requirement that the company first amend its regulations and have all
shareholders ratify the redemption agreement in advance therein. If he fails to do this, Father may get caught
by the <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State> cases. Father could theoretically lend his
daughter’s company money, but in the real world that probably wouldn’t work
because the banks and suppliers would balk unless Father subordinated the debt
to all institutional creditors.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In one case, a minority shareholder had veto power over
dividends. He was wealthy and wanted <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>zero</i> dividends. The younger people needed dividends to get
living expenses! This ended up in a suit,
and the court held that a minority shareholder with veto power will be
considered a de facto controlling shareholder and will thus be subject to the
same liabilities. Likewise, in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
if you run the citatory on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i>
you’ll find an Ohio Court of Appeals case that is exactly the same: minority
shareholders with veto power through a shareholders’ agreement can be held to
the same standard.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>R.C. 1701.95 refers us back to .04-.06 and .11-.37. There are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>two
tests</i> for a stock dividend in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. There is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>total surplus </i>test. After a
dividend, the total surplus must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>zero</i>
or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>positive</i>. There are two flavors of surplus: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>earned surplus </i>is a running balance of net
profits minus dividends minus losses and minus certain portions of stock
redemptions. The balance of earned
surplus can be positive, negative, or zero. The other flavor of surplus is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>capital
surplus</i>. There are four ways to
create a capital surplus (four subaccounts). Each subaccount will be either zero or positive; never negative. The four subaccounts are (1) consideration in
excess of par, (2) donated surplus, (3) reduction surplus, which comes about by
reducing the par value of outstanding stock, and (4) contrary to generally
accepted accounting principles, <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
allows <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>revaluation surplus</i>. If you have land that cost you $1 million and
it’s now worth $10 million, you can put on the left-hand side of the balance
sheet: “Revaluation of land: $9 million”, and then on the right-hand bottom of
the balance sheet, you add in “revaluation surplus” in the amount of $9
million. Legal scholars think that <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> allow the same, but
Shipman has never been totally sure. In
some states, the surplus test is limited to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>earned
surplus</i>. In both <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, you put the two
together to see if you meet the test. Most companies keep the GAAP flavors.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The second test which must also be met in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>insolvency</i> test, which is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cash flow</i> test. It is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equity
</i>insolvency test, which is: do you have enough liquid assets to pay your
liabilities as they come due in the course of business? The other insolvency test is the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bankruptcy </i>insolvency test: do assets
exceed liabilities? In the Bankruptcy
Code, each test is used in various places. But you must meet both tests, or else directors are personally liable
for issuing dividends. Read R.C. 1701.95
carefully and you will find that if the directors rely in good faith upon
outside CPAs, company officers, and lawyers, then they’ll be in good
shape. But what’s wrong with relying on
lawyers? Most lawyers won’t help you
much because they don’t want to get involved! However, if you have good officers who have prepared good written
reports, then that helps. If you can get
an outside firm to check the numbers, that’s also good. A lawyer will tell you that the defense
exists and how to get it. If you follow
a good lawyer’s advice on procedure and do things by the numbers, then you’ll
be ahead in court.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There is a crucial Fifth Circuit bankruptcy case from the
1930’s called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Arnold v. Phillips</i>. It holds that in bankruptcy, where debt
obligations are issued in a stock redemption or dividend, the test is applied <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>twice</i>: initially, and also when payment
is due. Shipman believes that this case
is still good law. In addition, <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and other states the fraudulent conveyance statutes are applicable. As a remedy against the recipient
shareholders, they are better than the corporate statute. The Ohio Fraudulent Preference Statute, R.C.
1336.56-.59, and the Ohio Fraudulent Transfer Act both are especially hard on
preferences to insiders (what the Securities Act of 1933 would call
“affiliates”). In the Enron bankruptcy, for
example, two days before the bankruptcy filing the company bought about $100
million in certified checks from the bank and paid a lot of insiders. There is a suit to set aside this purchase as
fraudulent or wrongful purchases under the Bankruptcy Act. Shipman thinks that the trustee in bankruptcy
will win.</p>

<p><b>Agent for an
undisclosed principal or a partially undisclosed principal</b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Securities and
Exchange Comm’n v. Texas Gulf Sulfur Co.</i> – You’re a big <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> based sulfur company. You dig a big hole in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and set a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>core </i>to <st1:City><st1:place>Salt
  Lake City</st1:place></st1:City> to be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>assayed</i>. A visual inspection is done, and it looks
good. Another look showed that it was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>spectacular</i>. It’s not a sure thing that there’s sulfur or
other minerals for miles around. It
looks like it is potentially good. What
the company did was to hire non-employees to go up to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and talk to the farmers on top of the land and offer them a good price for the
lease but not the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>near-spectacular</i>
price that the land was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really</i>
worth. The agents were probably not told
of the results. Really confidential info
is given out on a “need-to-know” basis. These people bought in their own names and took title in their own
names. After the second, truthful press
release they transferred title to Texas Gulf Sulfur, which in turn reimbursed
them.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let us analyze this in the agency context: they were agents
for an undisclosed principal. Is this
per se against public policy or fraudulent? No, it’s definitely not. There
are many big investors, buying under 5% of outstanding shares, who want to keep
their transactions confidential for various legitimate reasons. If you happen to get hints from the press
that all is not well, you can sell without any restriction under 10b-5 and you
don’t have to deal with Rule 144 paperwork. On the other hand, they may use the press carefully to find out that
there is positive news and they want to load up on more stock. In a big Second Circuit case, a person was an
agent for the world’s biggest user of a certain commodity. But if there is a fiduciary duty between the
agent and the third party or the principal and the third party, then you must
come clean up front. Also, if the third
party puts the direct question to the agent: “Are you buying only for your own
account and not for resale?” and the agent lies, there is an action in fraud.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two “curlicues” on the doctrine. The plaintiff’s lawyer will always look for
this early if the apparent defendant is judgment-proof. On the other hand, if the defendant is GM or
Exxon, you’ll always get paid if you win. What happens if the principal gives the agent the money up front to buy
the commodity with, and the agent squanders it away? That may be the commission of a fraud upon
the principal because the money was given in trust. If the principal pays up front and the agent
doesn’t pay, there are two rules. The
majority rule is that you can’t reach the principal under the doctrine of agent
for an undisclosed principal. The more
modern rule in Restatement Second of Agency is to the contrary: whether or not
the principal has already paid the agent, the third party can get relief from
the principal even though the principal has to pay twice. You hire people who you can trust completely
and who are financially solvent to do this kind of thing.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas Gulf Sulfur</i>,
the farmers were all paid. They hired
responsible people who issued their own checks that were valid. The farmers sued for rescission. Texas Gulf Sulfur settled the fraud
suits. The Canadian provinces later
amended their statutes to require disclosure up front of the drilling
information, that is, it would be considered material to the transaction.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What is a partially disclosed principal? This is where the agent says: “I’m buying for
someone else and I can’t tell you who it is, but I’ll give you my own check and
my check is good.” The rules are fairly
close to those for the completely undisclosed principal.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In fraud and related theories, we are assuming no fiduciary
relationship at all. You have big
problems! Starting in 1910, American
fraud law began to expand. Prior to
1910, the law of fraud was very narrow when it relied upon total
non-disclosure. It was helpful if there
was an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overt material representation</i>
or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>half-truth</i>. But if there was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>total non-disclosure</i> and no fiduciary or other special relationship
between the parties, most American courts would not have allowed a fraud
claim. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Samford Brass</i>, consistent with Restatement Second of Torts, deals
with the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>special fact doctrine</i>, where
the total non-disclosure is about not only a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>material</i> fact, but a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>highly</i>
material fact which we will call a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>special</i>
fact. Note that a highly material fact
puts the case in the arena of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sherwood v.
Walker</i>, the barren cow case.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This case involves securities. We have an AMEX company that needs to raise
equity capital. They undertake a Rule
506 offering with, among others, Mr. P who is generally sophisticated and
moderately knowledgeable about securities. The company sells him options to buy stock. In those days, that meant the option would
have to be held for two years before you could get an unlegended security, and
then the security would have to be held for two years. The security was unlegended. The private placement memo did not mention
the Rule 144 restrictions on disposition. The stock does very well for a time, during which Mr. P goes to the
company and asks to exercise the option. He would have made a lot of money. But the president of the company says that exercising the option would
violate Rule 144. By the time the
holding period was satisfied, the stock had plummeted. A diversity suit was brought in federal court
under <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> law including
contract and fraud theories. It is
stipulated that there is no fiduciary or special relationship between the
parties, in which case a non-disclosure of even a simple material fact could
have been fraudulent.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>On the contract count, the court held that the plaintiff
didn’t have a cause of action. On the
fraud side, they reversed summary judgment for the defendant and remanded for
trial. They said that <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> law would govern. The case is not under 10b-5. In fact, often your remedies are better under
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>state</i> than <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>federal</i> law. 10b-5 is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>high scienter</i> section. The court found a <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> case from 1920 dealing with an upscale piano
store with a huge showroom of half new and half high-quality refurbished
pianos. A lady came into the store
thinking a piano was new. She was not
told otherwise, and so she wrote a check and took the piano home. Later, the piano tuner told her that it
wasn’t new. She sued in fraud, with the
stipulation that there was no fiduciary relationship. There were no consumer laws at the time. The Court of Appeals of <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> held that where one party to the contract is
under a false impression as to a special fact and the other party knows that
false impression and doesn’t correct it, then if scienter can be shown, there
is fraud even though there is no fiduciary or other special relationship. The Restatement Second of Torts follows the
same doctrine.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A case with a similar result under contract doctrine comes
from the 1970’s in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Stare v. Tate</i>. A couple were getting divorced. <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
is a community property state. As to the
husband’s personal earnings post-marriage, even if that property is titled in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>his </i>name alone, it is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>community property</i> and the wife has a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vested</i> right in that property. In a common law state, if she dies before
him, her interest is said to be inchoate and her will would pass nothing. In both common law and community property
states, a divorce results in a 50-50 split in marital or community
property. The woman’s lawyer sends to
the man’s lawyer the final draft of the papers they were to sign for the
property settlement. It was based on the
negotiation of the principal. The wife’s
lawyer made a $250,000 mistake against her. The lawyer turns to the client, saying “we ought to tell them their
figures are screwed up”. The husband
says “no way”. In theory, the judge
ought to look over the papers, but the judge never will. The judge just glances at them. If the husband had stayed quiet, probably no
one would have every discovered it. But
later, at a cocktail party, the ex-husband went up to the ex-wife and tells her
how he cheated her out of marital property. She brings an action to reopen the settlement. The judge finds that there is a contract
principle that is very similar to the tort principal. Always look at both the contract and tort
remedies! There are times you do not
have to show bad faith or scienter in contracts, and the statute of limitations
may be a lot longer.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We have two subdivisions of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Texas Gulf Sulfur </i>case: we’ll pay more attention to the insider
trading portion but we’ll also deal with the issue of the press release. The top brass of the company told everyone to
keep quiet. Was the management of the
company in violation of § 13 by imposing a blackout period? The court says no: it was within their
business judgment. The SEC agreed. But some people didn’t keep the
blackout! They told other people to go
out and buy lots of stock! This is a
civil proceeding for injunctive relief and disgorgement. The courts have held that the SEC has
inherent power to go into the federal courts and get disgorgement. Note, however, that Sarbanes-Oxley goes
beyond disgorgement. The court holds
that the rule is that mere possession of material inside information is enough
to put everyone under the “Just Say No” rule. The company insiders said that they weren’t allowed to disclose because
the president of the company would fire them. The court says that they should abstain. The thrust of the ruling is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equal
protection</i>. It’s a typical <st1:Street><st1:address>Warren
  Court</st1:address></st1:Street> equal protection opinion, albeit at the
Court of Appeals level. The court also
holds that those who tipped and those who are tipped off can be forced to
disgorge their unjust gains. The case
never made complete sense because Rule 10b-5 is a fraud section. Under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ernst
&amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder</i>, decided later, it was made clear that the
plaintiff must plead and prove scienter.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about the press release? The majority opinion screws up worse. They say the company will be civilly liable
to people selling on the basis of the press release without any discussion of
scienter. Judge Friendly’s concurring
opinion corrects the majority opinion. We now have the 1995 Act which adds on more. Note the potential liability associated with
false press releases and the like. The
DJIA has gone up from 880 to 10,300 since 1981. Some days the volume on the NYSE is 2-3 billion shares. The over-the-counter market has also
grown. The 1995 Act tries to deal with
this. It enacts a “statutory caution
defense”: if your press release has enough cautionary language, you won’t be
held liable. The case law has also
developed this independently of the statute.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Apple Computer had a successful IPO in the 1970’s. They were going to come out with Lisa. Steve Jobs put out a bunch of glowing press
releases and a lot of people believed him. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times covered the new computer and
they wrote many stories saying it was all crap. The stock shot up and then took a nosedive. The first issue was whether press releases
could trigger 10b-5. Could people
reading the press releases rely on 10b-5 to get relief if the stock took a
nosedive? The court said that if you
promote your products vigorously enough, you can get sued under 10b-5. The president wanted indemnity from the
company <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and vice versa</i>. The jury came in saying that the company had
zero liability, but the president had liability of $100 million. The judge set aside the verdict and ordered a
new trial. The Ninth Circuit opinion
added an important defense: the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>total mix
of information</i>. They told the judge
that on retrial he must let in as evidence all of the WSJ and NYT articles
because it could be the case that the articles were circulated so broadly that
there could have been no reliance on the Apple press releases. Rumor has it that the company settled to the
tune of $21 million.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In 2003, the California Supreme Court, reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6)
motion (which, in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State> is
called a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general demurrer</i>), there was
a company that put out materially misleading press releases. The suit was brought by someone who bought
stock in the company but did not sell. He alleged that he relied on the press release. Such a person has no cause of action under
Rule 10b-5. The California Supreme Court
held that this probably <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>did</i> allege a
cause of action under <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
common law. The court hinted that the
fault standard is negligence, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not
scienter</i>. It’s a highly unnerving
opinion!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas Gulf Sulfur</i>
deals with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>organized trading market
transactions</i>. The people are not
dealing one-on-one with each other. Someone buys GM stock and it later goes down. GM had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>suspected</i>
that things were going bad but kept quiet for two weeks while investigating it
and a negative press release comes out after you buy. Under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sherwood
v. Walker</i>, can you go to the SEC and have them find out who was on the
other side of your transaction and force the other person to rescind? No, because this is impractical. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sherwood</i>
must be restricted to one-on-one situations. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas Gulf Sulfur</i> is
extremely egalitarian and equal protection-based. The next two cases add several limits. All of Rule 10b-5 is fraud-based and requires
scienter. It is generally agreed that
Rule 14e-3, adopted under § 14(e), requires <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no
fraud</i>. Textual analysis of § 14(e)
suggests that the first sentence, which is self-executing, deals with
fraud. The second sentence, which came a
few years later and which is not self-executing (that is, requires rulemaking)
is clearly <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> fraud-based.</p>

deal was for. Chiarella runs out and
calls his broker to load up on the stock of the target company. The offer was going to be at a substantial
cash premium. Chiarella doesn’t know who
reported him, but it might have been a broken romance. This is the first criminal prosecution for
Rule 10b-5 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ever</i>. Up to 30 years ago, criminal statutes were <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rarely</i> used for white-collar crime. The jury found him guilty and the Second
Circuit affirmed. It was held that the
indictment alleged no crime, and thus the conviction was overturned.<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Justice Powell said that neither Mr. Chiarella nor the
employer owed a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of the target company. Both Mr. Chiarella and his employer <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>did</i>, however, owe a fiduciary duty to
the offeror. For the first time before
the U.S. Supreme Court, the government says there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>another theory</i> that they want to pull out. They want to claim that this was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>misappropriation</i> of the principal’s
confidential information, which, in itself, should be considered fraud. But the theory wasn’t raised in the
indictment, which means that it couldn’t be raised later! But the misappropriation theory is alive and
well, at least in the Second Circuit.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Take, for example, the case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>United States v. Carpenter</i> out of the Supreme Court. Carpenter landed a job at the Wall Street
Journal. He wrote a column called “Heard
on the Street” that had a great effect on the market. Some traders would get up extra early to get
the WSJ and read that particular column and trade based on what it said. Carpenter told his lovers of this, and they
made out like bandits. If he was going
to say something good about a company, he would tell his lovers in
advance. At the various brokerage houses
where his lovers traded, the compliance officers and computers picked up on the
pattern. They went to the SEC and the
United States Attorney. There was a
joint investigation, and eventually Carpenter confessed. There was a criminal prosecution under Rule
10b-5 and the Federal Mail/Television/Radio Fraud Act. The jury convicted him on both counts. The Second Circuit affirmed. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court,
where the mail fraud count was affirmed 8-0. He clearly had violated the mail fraud statute by robbing his employer
of confidential information. The Rule
10b-5 count was affirmed 4-4. There
hasn’t been a subsequent opinion on the theory of misappropriation, so the
Second Circuit continues to apply it. The theory is rather uneven in other circuits.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>That’s not the end of the story. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>SEC v.
Dirks</i> was an appeal of an SEC disciplinary action against a
broker-dealer. In this opinion, the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Chiarella </i>test was made more
explicit. The opinion said that mere
possession of inside information is not enough for Rule 10b-5. To that extent, both of these Supreme Court
cases limit the ruling in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas Gulf
Sulfur</i>. The tipper must have
violated his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>duty of loyalty</i> to the
company, and there must be a benefit to the tipper. Rule 10b-5 is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>fraud</i> section. Many things
can be a benefit: (1) business benefits, (2) reciprocity benefits, or (3)
social/romantic/sexual benefits.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The president of an NYSE company goes to a bar and bring his
assistant along, gets drunk, talks too loud, and Mr. X overhears in the next
booth. Mr. X has no fiduciary
relationship with the company or anyone else. Can Mr. X, insofar as 10b-5 is concerned, trade on this
information? Yes! On the other hand, if the president of the
company talks about a tender offer that the company is going to make in two
weeks at a big premium, we go to Rule 14e-3 which says that in the limited
context of a tender offer reinstates the broad <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>mere possession</i> test of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas
Gulf Sulfur</i>. Note that the second
sentence of Rule 14e-3 is not a fraud section. It is also quite broad in that it applies to any tender offer of any
security of any company, public or private. These provisions are most certainly enforced! Computers can catch them or ex-lovers can tip
off investigators.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Chiarella</i> itself
established that 10b-5 is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraud </i>rule. That was amplified by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>SEC v. Dirks</i>. The latter
case held that the tipper must have violated his duty of loyalty to the company
and must have received a benefit, broadly defined, from doing so. A breach of the duty of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>care</i> of the tipper to the company is not enough.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In a prior exam, the CEO of an NYSE company went with an
assistant to a local café, ordered too much to drink, and talked way too loud
to his assistant. In the booth next to
him was Mr. X, who owed no fiduciary duty to the company or the two
individuals. He overheard, and he went
out and loaded up on the company’s stock. 10b-5 does not apply to this situation because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Chiarella</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dirks</i>,
insofar as 10b-5 is concerned, overrule the mere possession test of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas Gulf Sulfur</i>. This is due to the literal language of 10b-5
because it’s a fraud statute. Justice
Powell explained that journalists and others perform valuable functions in
society and in the securities markets. If a journalist gets a company official to say more than he should, with
the company official violating only his duty of care to the company and getting
no benefit, and the journalist spreads the word, then society is all the better
for it, so the journalist shouldn’t be punished.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Consider 14e-3 in this situation. The president and his executive assistant
were discussing a bigger NYSE company that was going to pick up the subject
NYSE company in a statutory merger at a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big</i>
premium. This was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>confidential</i>. Nobody knew it
except the two companies and their agents. Both § 14(e) and 14e-3 are limited to tender offers. So the question is whether a statutory merger
or sale of all assets is ever a tender offer. The answer is no, because they are both non-coercive in that the
shareholders and board of directors must vote on it. A tender offer is more hostile and doesn’t
require shareholder or board approval. So 14e-3 does not apply either. However, what Mr. X did in soliciting shareholders was probably a tender
offer and there was no compliance.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If 14e-3 had been adopted when <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Chiarella</i> was decided, then Mr. Chiarella would have run afoul of
14e-3 because the undisclosed information related to a tender offer and under
14e-3 the mere possession test of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas
Gulf Sulfur</i>, in that limited circumstance, is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>reinstated</i>. That is to say
that the plaintiff need not prove fraud, breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty,
or benefit by the tipper. Is 14e-3 a
valid Rule? Two big cases say yes, and
Shipman says they’re right. The first is
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>United States v. Chestman</i>, a criminal
case from the 1980’s from the Second Circuit. In this case, a wife of a top executive in <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> was told by her husband that there was going to
be a tender offer. She called her
daughter and shared this, telling the daughter up front, “Don’t tell anyone
else.” (Never do that!) The daughter then shared the information with
her husband. The daughter did not tell
the husband that it was highly confidential. The husband shared the information with his stock broker and doesn’t
tell the broker it’s confidential. So
the broker goes out and loads up on the company’s stock for himself and his
customers.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There followed a criminal prosecution under 14e-3 and 10b-5
of the stock broker. The husband was
granted immunity to testify against the broker. There was a jury conviction on both counts. The case came up before the Second
Circuit. As to 10b-5, the court applies
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dirks</i>-<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Chiarella</i> test. They hold
that the government didn’t prove that the daughter and the daughter’s husband
were fiduciaries to each other, and since the daughter didn’t get the husband
to promise to keep it confidential before she told him, the 10b-5 “chain” was
broken, and thus the broker’s conviction on the 10b-5 count had to be
overturned. But as to the 14e-3 count,
they held that the Rule is valid. They
ruled that no fiduciary duty need be found. The conviction was upheld and the sentence was not reduced.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are courts that would hold that there is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i> a fiduciary duty between husband
and wife under a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>status</i> concept so
long as they are living together and they’re not contemplating divorce. What the Court of Appeals held was that they
wouldn’t buy the status argument. They
admitted that fiduciary duty and confidential handling of information can flow
from one of two sources: (1) status, which is the most common, or (2)
contract. For example, if the wife had
said up front: “Husband, this must be kept in the strictest confidence, and
I’ll only tell you if you promise to keep it secret”, then there is a
contract. By contrast, if a cab driver
overhears you talking on a cell phone about anything but a tender offer, the
cabbie can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pig out</i> on that
stock. On the other hand, if you tell
the cab driver that you’re about to make a highly confidential call, ask him if
he will keep it confidential, and he says <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>yes</i>,
then there is a contractual fiduciary duty, and if the cab driver pigs out, he
violates Rule 10b-5.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A U.S. Supreme Court out of the last five years upheld
14e-3. In the process of doing so, they
also discussed 10b-5. A senior partner
in a <st1:City><st1:place>Minneapolis</st1:place></st1:City> law firm had
embezzled $500,000 from clients and was about to be found out. He needed a quick fix. A client of the firm was planning a
confidential tender offer at a big premium for the stock of X, Inc. He bought a bunch of options on X, Inc. in
his own name. The SEC, as to the public
trading markets, now heavily relies on computers, though it wasn’t always
so. In Justice Ginsburg’s opinion on
10b-5, she noted that the alleged wrongful sale or purchase must be proven to
be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on account of</i> the inside
information. She held that it was in
this particular case. The language of
this opinion led to the new rules 10-b5(1) and 10-b5(2) where you can send
notice to the SEC that you’re going to sell and if, at the time, there is no
undisclosed, unfavorable information, but such information develops after that,
you can still go ahead and sell under certain circumstances.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Also in the last five years, Regulation FD (“fair
disclosure”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relates to publicly
reporting companies. That’s because it’s
a rule under § 13, the reporting provision. If an officer or director spills the beans on undisclosed information,
then within two days you must publicly file a report with the SEC as to “what
the beans are” so that everybody can play on a level playing field. This was very controversial! The SEC chairman barely got it passed. The deciding vote came in from one of the
commissioners, who joined only after the Commission put in a big exemption from
the Rule: a bona fide member of the media doing bona fide media work to whom
the beans are spilled does not have to comply with Regulation FD. The holdout commissioner was correct, in
Shipman’s opinion. He didn’t want the
rule challenged on First Amendment grounds.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Since the 1980’s, there have been a number of amendments to
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on insider trading. None of the statutes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>define</i> insider trading; Congress has left that to the courts. However, there are a number of very important
provisions. One of them is that lawyers,
CPA firms, investment bankers, and the company itself must avoid reckless
conduct in safeguarding material, undisclosed inside information. In one of Shipman’s exam questions, a guy is
a partner in a law firm. His son goes to
the office and the father takes a phone call while the father is in the
office. The call is from someone
planning a big tender offer. The son is
a party animal! He’s also
quick-witted. He’s a finance major. He leaves and pigs out. How do we advice the senior partner of the
law firm when the FBI appears? First, we
tell him to be nice to the FBI. Next, we
advise him that the partner was reckless in talking in front of his son. Don’t share confidential information with
anybody. The partner is going to pay
treble damages! In a civil action, the
SEC can triple the ante! The partner
must come up with the big money to get the SEC and FBI off of the firm’s back. You have to give it to him straight,
according to Shipman. It’s his problem,
not the firm’s. Also, all law firms have
very careful written procedures on buying and selling securities that you must
adhere to. If you work for a firm that
does a lot of takeover work, the spouse should invest in mutual funds, not
stocks. Pigging out is a basic human
instinct!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297553"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Duties of care of loyalty and of full and
fair disclosure</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>These three duties overlap heavily. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23 and 23.1
have to do with kinds of class actions. 23.1 deals with a shareholder bringing a suit <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>on behalf of</i> the corporation. The duty doesn’t run to the shareholder personally, but it does run to
the corporation. It’s a lot harder to
start a Rule 23.1 action off the ground than it is to get a Rule 23 action
started. Under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i>, as to close corporations in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
one of the express holdings is that if it’s something that before <st1:place><i
 style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby</i></st1:place> you had to assert
derivatively, you can now go directly if it’s a close corporation. Why might you want to avoid a class
action? Class certification is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big</i> hurdle on things like preemptive
rights. You’d rather just bring it
directly.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This is an area of heavy legislative challenge. The 1995 Act, as to fraud actions involving
securities, put a whole new layer of restrictions on class actions or
quasi-class actions. A quasi-class
action is where twenty individual shareholders bring twenty different suits on
the same transaction. The 1998 Act
expanded this, saying that if the class action involving fraud and securities
is in the state courts under state law, then the defendants can <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>remove</i> them to the (more
defendant-friendly) federal courts. The
newest kid on the block, about to be born, is a bill before the Senate this
week. It’s a class action bill recently
passed by the House. It’s broader than
securities and says that as to many class actions entirely under state law,
even if only negligence is alleged, the defendants may remove to the federal
courts. This is very popular in the
House, but not popular with the federal bench. In the Senate, it’s going to be close. Shipman predicts it will become law eventually. At the state level, there has been a lot of
tort reform action, including in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. A massive bill just passed in <st1:State><st1:place>Mississippi</st1:place></st1:State>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Smith v. Van Gorkum </i>–
This is duty of care only. The directors
were the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cream</i> of the <st1:City><st1:place>Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
business community. The action was
brought as a class action after the merger rather than a derivative
action. The class action was approved by
the Chancery Court and the Supreme Court does not upset it. There was no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>special litigation committee</i> to pass on the action. The old man had met with Pritzker, of medical
school fame. They went to the
opera. Pritzker said: “I’ll make cash
merger offer to all of your shareholders at a 33% cash premium and I want you
to support it. I want the board to agree
not to shop it around.” The company
counsel tells him that if he doesn’t accept the offer, he could be held liable
in a shareholder derivative action. So
about an hour later, the deal is green-lighted. Keep in mind the big premium and the sterling reputation of the
Pritzkers. Because of the no-shop
clauses, they never sought an alternative deal. The deal was submitted to shareholders, who overwhelmingly approved
it. The merger closed, and then this
action was brought after the fact. The
chancellor threw the case out under the business judgment rule, saying that the
board met and considered the deal and thus it was fine.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This case hit the corporate world like a bombshell because
this is the way boards did business before this case! Before <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zahn
v. Transamerica</i>, the first big 10b-5 case, insider trading was rife! The Delaware Supreme Court says that the
business judgment rule can be shredded by the plaintiff showing (1) fraud, (2)
ultra vires, (3) bad faith, (4) arbitrary or capricious action, or (5) waste
(recklessness by the directors). But
then they added: (6) gross negligence on the merits, and (7) <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>procedural </i>gross negligence. Here, the Delaware Supreme Court said that
there was procedural gross negligence by the board, which gets us into the role
of shareholder approval in a public company in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In Delaware, the rule, at least since the 1940’s has been
that if holders of a disinterested majority of shares, after full and fair
disclosure up-front, vote <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> to sue
or to approve or ratify, then upon such approval the business judgment rule is
broadened. In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
if you have such approval and creditors aren’t hurt, then unless the plaintiff shows
(1) fraud, (2) ultra vires, (3) illegality, and (4) waste, then the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shareholders</i>’ <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>judgment</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rule</i> applies and
the plaintiffs are tossed out of court. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, it’s even
broader. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Claman v. Robertson</i> came from the 1940’s in the Ohio Supreme
Court. The Ohio Supreme Court held that
even if there were fraud upon the company, if the fraud were openly and fully
discussed in the proxy statement asking for the shareholders not to sue and
shareholders holding a disinterested majority vote <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not to sue</i>, then it will be okay. This didn’t work to save the defendants here because the proxy statement
to the shareholders was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>riddled</i> with
material disclosure violations.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A few final remarks on 10b-5: when a close corporation comes
under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i>, you need not
rely on federal law. He believes that
fraud is not required because the fiduciary duties are so intense. The absence of fraud is important because in
the last 25 years, the federal courts have required extremely heightened
pleading for fraud. Also, the 1995 Act
reinforces the requirement as to fraud class actions concerning
securities. If you can plead something
lesser than fraud, do it, because it’s much easier to make out a case. In addition, if the defendant has insurance,
remember that negligence and gross negligence will be covered by the policy,
while hardcore fraud will not be covered.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We’re leading up to a defense both to duty of care and duty
of loyalty actions: the defense of special litigation committees, composed of
truly independent outside directors studying the matter and concluding that it
ought to be stopped. We also look at the
defense on the merits of the shareholder decision not to sue. That will work under either duty of care or
duty of loyalty. It requires that you
can get disinterested shareholders holding a majority of the stock to vote with
you after full and fair disclosure up-front. You also must show that creditors are not harmed. This is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>non-unanimous shareholder ratification rule</i>. There is also a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>unanimous shareholder ratification rule</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let’s say three siblings each hold 10% of the stock of a Sub
C company. The father owns the remaining
70%. The three siblings are the
directors and officers and they set their own pay. In the absence of a defense, if the father
starts an action under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam </i>or
under Rule 23.1, the sibling’s only defense to the reasonableness of their
compensation is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overall reasonableness</i>. That is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i>
possible. If the defendants can show
overall reasonableness, both in disclosure and on the merits, and creditors
aren’t harmed, then they have a defense. Note that this is a defense <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on the
merits</i>. A little company like this
would not have outside directors who could set up a litigation committee. What would we advice the siblings? We would advise them to hold a joint
shareholders’ and directors’ meeting and get all four people to vote “yes” for
salaries. As long as there is full and
fair disclosure up-front and no creditors are harmed, this is an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>absolute defense</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here is another defense lawyer’s trick. Defense lawyers have tried to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bifurcate </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>trifurcate </i>the trial. If you
can convince the judge to do that up-front, then in the preceding example the
defense can be asserted early. If the
defendants win, they are home free because it’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>total</i> defense. This has
recently been used in the 1990’s Supreme Court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Exxon </i>case. The case came
out of <st1:State><st1:place>Hawaii</st1:place></st1:State>. Exxon had a huge tanker serviced under a
contract with a dry-dock company. That
company was negligent in servicing the Exxon ship, and as a result, the ship
developed serious problems upon leaving the dock. The captain forgot to map where he was! Because the captain didn’t know where he was,
the ship ran aground and caused a huge amount of damage.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Exxon sued the dry-dock company in negligence and in
contract. The attorney for the dry-dock
company convinced the judge to bifurcate, saying: “There is an overriding legal
principle that if <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ordinary </i>negligence
by the defendant is followed by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gross </i>negligence
on the part of the plaintiff, then there is no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>legal</i> cause, and thus the dry-dock company has a 100%
defense.” The judge granted the motion
and found that what the Exxon captain did was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>gross</i> negligence, and under respondeat superior, Exxon is bound by
the captain’s actions. He agreed with
the defendant’s legal principle in negligence and he also said the same
reasoning applied to the warranty count on the express written contract. Even if there is a warranty, the judge said,
if the plaintiff reacts with gross negligence then the company has a 100%
defense.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court held that the trial court judge was
totally correct on the merits. What the
defense lawyers did here is get to the “nub” of the matter quickly. Within each “half” of the case, they can use
12(b)(6) and summary judgment. The court
did not have to hear testimony about damages. They simply looked at one part of it.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the example above, what is done by the three siblings
will not bind the Internal Revenue Service because it’s a Sub C company. If the Internal Revenue Service comes
calling, you will have to persuade them. However, the brothers are very much protected. One of the requirements is that creditors are
not hurt. What if the brothers are paid
out much more than they’re worth?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marciano v. Nakash</i>
– In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>, as well as in some
other states, courts have held that the ultimate handling of conflicts of
interest is up to the court. If a party
meets those statutes, the court just pushes the burden of proof back to the
plaintiff. A case to that effect was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Comolli v. Comolli</i> from the California
Court of Appeals. In this case, we have
the flip side. This is a close
corporation with two 50% shareholders (different families). There are no independent, outside directors
on the board. One family runs the company. The company runs into financial
troubles. The family running the
company, without consulting the other family, lends the company money. The company goes insolvent and a state court
receivership is started in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>. The other family objects because the family
running the company could in no way approve the transaction under <st1:State><st1:place>Del.</st1:place></st1:State>
§ 144 since they held only 50% of the stock and there were no independent
outside directors on the board. The
family out of power thus said that the claim for the note is per se bad.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Delaware Supreme Court, very consistent to their earlier
case, says that the defense of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overall
reasonableness</i> both in disclosure and on the merits with no harm to
creditors is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i> available to a defendant
in a duty of loyalty action. Here, the
chancellor examined the loan carefully and found that the loan was reasonable
overall. There was no fraud or bad
faith. The court-made exception for
overall reasonableness that preceded the statute is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not touched</i> by the statute.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Heller v. Boylan</i> –
This case references the famous case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Rogers
v. Hill </i>from the U.S. Supreme Court of the 1920’s. George Washington Hill was the president of
American Tobacco Company in <st1:City><st1:place>New York City</st1:place></st1:City>. He was a “man about town”. In 1909, American Tobacco, a <st1:State><st1:place>New
  Jersey</st1:place></st1:State> company, had gone to the shareholders and
gotten them to approve, in the bylaws, a cash bonus plan based on tables, that
is, “if net profit is over <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>x</i>, then
set aside <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>z</i>%” and so on. American Tobacco proved extremely profitable
over the years and the cash bonuses went through the roof. A minority shareholder brought a
shareholders’ derivative action. There
was no committee of independent, outside directors to pass on it, so it went to
full trial. The case went in the federal
court on diversity jurisdiction, and was decided, pre-<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Erie</i>, under federal common law (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Swift
v. Tyson</i>). The U.S. Supreme Court
held, similar to the <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
courts, that even with full and fair disclosure up-front, approval of a
disinterested majority of shareholders, and no injury to creditors, then if it
amounts to waste, it’s no good. Hill
objected that the “money machine” can’t be turned off because the cash bonus
plan was in the bylaws. The Court said
that it was part of the duty of the directors to recommend an amendment to the
shareholders that is contrary to the directors’ interests. In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
the doctrine of waste is now well entrenched.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the Delaware Supreme Court in the past three years, there
was a case involving Walt Disney. Michael Eisner hired an assistant weirder than him. They didn’t get along well, and he decided to
terminate the assistant. They came up
with a termination package and it was put before the board for approval. Most of the board consisted of independent,
outside directors. Before trial, the
Delaware Supreme Court determined whether the pleadings were good enough. They said that waste is alleged. The case was sent back. There was also a case involving The Limited
recently in the same court. The Limited
is a big NYSE company, and there are a lot of social friends of Les Wexner on
the board. He entered into a conflict of
interest transaction with The Limited, and the independent directors blessed
the transaction. The chancellor examined
the exact relationship of each of the alleged outside directors and found,
contrary to first appearance, they had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very</i>
significant business dealings with Wexner. The case was remanded for trial, and The Limited later settled the case.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sinclair Oil Corp. v.
Levien</i> – Sinclair USA is a big oil company. It owned about 93% of Sinclair Venezuela. The latter was, itself, a public company with
several hundred shareholders. The
directors and officers of Sinclair Venezuela were all directors, officers, or
employees of Sinclair USA. Sinclair USA
needed money. The directors of Sinclair
Venezuela declared very good dividends over a number of years so that the
parent corporation could replenish its bank account. Here we have a “man bites dog” lawsuit! It’s not a suit to force declaration of
dividends, but rather a suit by the minority shareholders that the payment of
these dividends hurt Sinclair Venezuela because they had business opportunities
that they could have taken advantage of if not for the dividend policy. The threshold question was whether the case
should be judged under conflict of interest analysis. If you do, Sinclair USA must prove overall
reasonableness. On the other hand, is
the case to be judged under the business judgment rule where the plaintiff, in
order to stay in court, would have to show fraud, ultra vires, illegality,
arbitrary action, or gross negligence to “shred the shield”.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The court pointed out that the dividends did not violate any
bank loan agreement or the <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
restrictions on dividends (that is, you must have surplus and the dividend
can’t leave you cash flow insolvent). The court said that even though it may <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>look</i> like a conflict of interest transaction, if the parent
received nothing out of it except a ratable return on each share of its stock,
equal to the ratable return each minority shareholder received on their stock,
then it’s not governed by conflict of interest principles, and you must look at
the business judgment rule! On the
merits, they held that there is no reason to shred the business judgment
shield. There were a few contracts that
the parent had entered into with the subsidiary that the parent wasn’t
performing. The court held that there
was a conflict of interest there.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Weinberger v. UOP,
Inc.</i> – Both of these companies are NYSE public companies. The parent owned 51% of the stock of the
subsidiary from an earlier friendly cash tender offer. The parent has extra money to invest and it’s
looking for something to invest in. The
financial and operating folks figure that if they can get the other 49% of the
subsidiary at the same price per share they paid for the first 51% then it
would be a great investment. At the time
of the friendly tender offer, the board of directors of the subsidiary
contained a majority of independent outside directors. But at the time of the controversy, only
three out of the seven board members were independent. The parent wanted a cash-out merger, meaning
that the subsidiary would be merger into the parent for cash and the parent
would pay cash only. This invoked the
proxy rules at the subsidiary level since the subsidiary was an NYSE
company. The Securities Act of 1933 was
not applicable to the transaction because cash is not a security either for
federal, <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> or <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Was Rule 13e-3 applicable to the situation? This is the “going private” rule. It applies only to SEC-reporting
companies. It was not in effect at the
time, but let us describe the effect it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>would</i>
have had. The thrust of the rule is that
if you have a public company with public shareholders having equity securities
and through one or more transactions with an affiliate those public
shareholders who <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>did</i> have equity
securities end up with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no</i> equity
securities then <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the rule applies</i>. Note that if the rule had been in effect at
the time, it would have applied. The
rule says that, in addition to all other disclosure, the board of directors, in
the proxy statement, must expressly state whether, in their opinion, the
transaction is fair to minority shareholders. The board of directors must give detailed reasons for their
conclusion. The Rule goes on to say that
the directors cannot delegate this task to an investment banker, though they
will hire an investment banker to help them. This is a high burden because the Rule goes on to state that
projections, forward-looking information, appraisals, and “soft” data must be
consulted. You must go way beyond GAAP!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The parent’s financial department had worked up tables
indicating that the stock of the subsidiary would be worth about $22 or
$23. They wanted to pay $19 which is
what they paid before. The parent went
through the books and records of the subsidiary without the consent of the
board of directors of the subsidiary. They did their due diligence without the consent of the board. The information of the subsidiary belongs to
the subsidiary, not the parent! They
also did not set up an independent negotiating committee. They had three outside directors. The court says that they should have
appointed an independent negotiating committee who would acquire independent
counsel, investment bankers and CPAs and that if they had done all that, the
business judgment rule would have saved the parent. There was no approval by a disinterested
majority of shareholders, because a majority of shareholders <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were </i>interested!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Self-dealing is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>serious</i>
conflict of interest. You can revert to
the more hospitable business judgment rule if you set up an independent
negotiating committee at the subsidiary, but in this case the parent did not. There is no other defense available. Therefore, the parent has the burden of
pleading and proving overall reasonableness. Overall reasonableness includes reasonableness on the merits as well as
reasonableness of disclosure. The
parent’s records showed that they believed the stock was worth $22-23. That was never disclosed to anyone at the
subsidiary. The defense was not made
out, and thus the case was remanded to determine damages. If you proceed under duty of loyalty,
causation-in-fact can often go by the wayside. You also do not need to show fraud or bad faith if the plaintiff shows a
serious conflict of interest. In that
case, it is up to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>defendant</i> to
make out one of the four or five applicable defenses. If the defendant fails to make those out, the
defendant is going to be a big loser.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What’s the fallout? Rule 13e-3 would be applicable today. The federal disclosure requirements don’t add a lot to the <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
requirements. There are two Sixth
Circuit cases, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nationwide v. Howing</i>
from the 1970’s that discuss <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
fiduciary duty law and Rule 13e-3. The
casebook tells us that we’re in the area of “squeeze-outs”, or cash-out
mergers. The casebook gives us a number
of cases. In a number of jurisdictions,
there are some very strict anti-squeeze-out cases. But Shipman suggests that where there is full
and fair disclosure up-front (no fraud), there are instances where a
squeeze-out is fair.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Consider a Washington Supreme Court case from the 1950’s, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Matteson v. Zielbarth</i>. A small startup corporation was about 63%
owned by one person who worked there full-time. The other guy owned slightly more than one-third, enough to block a
merger. Business was rough, and the company
was about to go under. The fellow
running the company did some shopping around and found Z, Inc., which thinks
they have a pretty good business. If the
minority shareholder will agree to certain terms, Z, Inc. will swoop in and
take over the business, continuing to employ the fellow running the company.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It is stipulated that the fellow running the company was
honest and that the salary he was receiving was reasonable. The salary being offered by Z is also
stipulated to be reasonable. The
minority shareholder decided to be difficult. The shareholder decided that he wanted a portion of the money the main
guy gets or else he would use his power to block the deal. The guy running the company, with the consent
of Z, Inc., set up a new company, N, Inc., and merged the old company into the
new company with him getting stock and with the minority shareholder being
cashed out. There was no fraud;
everything was done on the up and up. There was a strong business purpose. Shipman believes that the deal was reasonable. The court says that where the person being
frozen out has an appraisal remedy, if he waits until after the merger to sue,
then he has no damage remedy (as long as there is no fraud).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are three <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
cases we should know about in this area: first, there’s the case of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McConnell</i> dealing with the Bluejackets
from the Court of Appeals, after 1995. McConnell and the Wolff family got together to get an NHL team for <st1:City><st1:place>Columbus</st1:place></st1:City>. They didn’t have an arena yet. They went to the mayor and City Council. McConnell, the Wolffs, and Lamar Hunt formed
an LLC and got a ballot initiative for a half-percent sales tax to build an
arena. The ballot initiative was killed
partly by Bob Fitrakis raising up a storm on talk radio.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>They still wanted a team! They went to the NHL and Nationwide Insurance. The head of Nationwide indicated that they
would consider building the arena and leasing it to the team, which is what
ultimately occurred. Hunt wasn’t
thrilled with this change, and decided to block the transaction. McConnell and Wolff formed a new limited
partnership and went ahead. Hunt sued on
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>corporate opportunity </i>and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>freeze-out</i>. In the LLC agreement, a very important clause
said that any one of the members <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could </i>compete
with the LLC. That is often included in
real estate LLCs because real estate folks often have side ventures. The Court of Appeals in <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Franklin</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>County</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> held that because of the
clause in the LLC agreement, the transaction was reasonable. This is one of the leading cases in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
on Business Associations law. The
opinion talks about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i>
and other important <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> cases.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>When is the appraisal remedy a shareholder’s sole
remedy? The Ohio Supreme Court decided
two cases on this issue on the same day in the early 1990’s. The cases mean different things to different
people. One was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Stepak v. Schey</i> and the other was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>State v. Maraschari</i>. Here is
Shipman’s interpretation: when one minority shareholder sues in advance to
block a deal, the fact that he would have an appraisal remedy at the end does <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>toss him out of court. If you sue to enjoin, you may have to post a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big </i>bond. When you sue <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>afterwards</i> and there is no fraud or major disclosure discrepancy,
the cases suggest that in the absence of ultra vires, you can’t get damages,
rather, you must elect the appraisal remedy.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>Corporate opportunity</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This grew tremendously in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. In 1910, you had to prove an expectancy in
the corporation in order to prove corporate opportunity. That changed in the 1930’s with one of the
most famous cases ever decided: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Guth v.
Loft</i>, out of the Delaware Supreme Court, which involved Pepsi. The decision was very pro-plaintiff.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Another case was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Irving
Trust Company v. Duetsch</i>, which was from the Second Circuit in the
1920’s. There was a struggling
company. The DeForrest patents come on
the market. The controlling person
doesn’t have enough money to buy them from the holder. But the controlling person thinks that he can
rake up the cash in a couple of months. He wants to tie up the patents, so he has the company sign a contract to
buy the patents with the closing several months in the future. If he couldn’t raise the money, he figured it
would be the company on the line and not him. But his goal was to raise the money. He worked hard and succeeded. He
caused the company to assign the contract to him. He closed on the contract and made a lot of
money.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The company went bankrupt, and the trustee in bankruptcy is
the universal successor to everything the company had, including causes of
action against affiliates. So the
trustee in bankruptcy sues. It’s a close
case because the law says that a wealthy director, officer, or controlling
person does not have lend money to the company when it wants to take an
opportunity. In this case, the court
held that as a prophylactic principal that where the company has obligated
itself by signing a contract, the controlling person cannot use the defense
that the company didn’t have the money. If the controlling person takes over the contract and it’s good, then
the company or the trustee in bankruptcy will sue in constructive trust,
damages, and accounting.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller</i>
out of the Minnesota Supreme Court from the 1960’s does a good job summarizing
the law of corporate opportunity from the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. The early cases aren’t fully
consistent. The court’s reaction is to
say that when it comes right down to it, the test is really just whether what
the officer or controlling person did was reasonable. In the 1970’s, the ALI stepped into the
fray. They come up with a Restatement
which says that if the controlling person or officer or directors does not
disclosure what he is going to do at the outset to the other directors,
officers and shareholders, then he has per se violated his fiduciary duty and
the corporation can sue him.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Northeast Harbor Golf
Club, Inc. v. Harris</i> – This case follows the Restatement. <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
within the past 25 years, has expressly rejected the ALI Restatement and they
stick with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Guth v. Loft</i>. They probably would not be unhappy with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller</i>.</p>

interest</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let us finish up the material on conflicts of interest, then
we’ll look at partnerships, which we’ll look at today, tomorrow, and the day
after. We’ll do limited partnerships and
LLCs on Thursday.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i>
– This is a highly egalitarian decision that came as a big shock to the
corporate community. There were earlier
cases dealing with the sale of a control bloc to a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>looter</i>. The big case was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gerdes v. Reynolds</i> from the Supreme
Court of New York in the 1930’s. What
were the facts back in that case? There
was a liquid pool of money in the corporation. The corporation was managed, under contract, by an investment
company. The investment advisor had two
classes of stock: (1) the voting stock, and (2) non-voting stock. A purchaser appeared for the voting stock,
offering much more than liquidation value for the stock. The officers, directors, and controlling
person making the sale did <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i>
checking of the proposed purchaser, but not enough—they were negligent. The stock was sold. The purchaser took out the old board and put
in his guys, as you would expect. The
new guys looted the investment company! The trustee in bankruptcy brought suit in state court against the
controlling shareholder and the officers and directors of the seller. It was held that the trustee in bankruptcy
could get a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>double recovery</i>. He could recover jointly and severally the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>control premium</i> that the purchase paid
for the voting stock. Next, in ordinary
negligence, the trustee in bankruptcy could recover <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>from the same group</i>. All
jurisdictions follow the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>looting cases</i>. Within the past twenty years, a <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
decision has expressly approved them.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman</i> itself is
a diversity case in the Second Circuit under <st1:State><st1:place>Indiana</st1:place></st1:State>
law. The facts took place during the
Korean War. At time, especially during
war, wage and price controls are imposed by the federal government, and the
Korean War was one of those times. When
those controls are imposed, you get <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>startling</i>
results concerning the exemptions. In
both World War II and the Korean War, employee fringe benefits such as pension
and profit sharing plans as well as Blue Cross/Blue Shield were exempt from
wage and price controls. Furthermore,
government contractors making those payment were allowed to recoup them as cost
from the federal government. The federal
government treated those costs as legitimate. Out of these wars sprouted employer-paid Blue Cross/Blue Shield and
pension/profit-sharing plans because during both periods companies needed every
able-bodied worker they could find and they could not raise the wage level to
attract more workers. They couldn’t
raise wages, but they could pay fringe benefits.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The same thing was true with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perlman </i>in the Korean War. There were huge federal contracts left for big companies like GM. All of these contracts involved using a lot
of steel. There was not enough steel to
go around. The end users could not raise
the price that they paid for steel, but the price of stocks and bonds of
corporations was not subject to the wage and price controls. Therefore, if you were an end user like GM
and you were having trouble getting steel, you would get together with another
end user and try to buy mid-sized steel companies by buying the controlling
bloc of stock. The end users who bought
stock from the controlling family did not loot or financially abuse the
company. They paid a fair price by the
steel. We know it was fair because it
was set by central planners (ha ha). The
case was brought originally as a shareholders’ derivative action, which would
indicate that the plaintiff thought the recovery ought to go into the corporate
treasury.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the course of the Second Circuit opinion, we see a
strange “mid-course correction”: the opinion starts out by saying that “control
is a corporate asset” and that the controlling person has misused or
misappropriated it for himself. Then,
towards the end of the opinion, the court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>oozes</i>
into the remedy: they decide to share the control premium with the minority
shareholders, indicating that this right can be asserted either derivatively,
as a duty owed to the corporation (under FRCP Rule 23.1) or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directly</i>, as a class action (Rule 23) on
the basis of duties owed to the minority shareholders themselves. The court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could
have</i> cited a case that we started the course with, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Speed v. Transamerica</i>, for that exact proposition (and Shipman says
they should have). The <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
cases expressly say that the cause of action is AC/DC: it can be asserted
either or both ways.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Since this case, the <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
courts have said that if there is no looting and no fraud by the corporate
shareholders, then the controlling bloc of stock is his and it’s prerogative to
get as much money as he can. The <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> rule is discussed in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Wellman v. Dickinson </i>out of the Southern District of New York. It is found in F.Supp. from the 1960’s. <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
law is followed and discussed. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Speed v. Transamerica</i> is the first case
that says controlling shareholders owe special duties <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>both</i> to the company and to the minority shareholders. As the century goes back, we’ll get more
egalitarian in most states.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>,
we have one of the leading cases in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brown
v. Halbert</i>. It’s a published opinion
by the California Court of Appeals from the 1960’s. What were the facts? Mr. X owned about 80% of a prosperous stock
savings and loan in the 1970’s before the air went out of S &amp; L
stocks. Mr. Purchaser approached Mr. X
and said: “Merge your company into mine in a statutory merger, and I will pay
you and the minority shareholders a certain number of dollars per share.” A statutory merger or sale of all assets
tends to spread the control premium out over all shareholders on a per share
basis. Mr. X said: “No way! Can you make me another offer?” Mr. Purchaser says: “I think I see what
you’re driving at. I’ll buy your 80% at
more bucks per share and then we’ll work together to get the minority
shareholders to sell out at a lower price.” They did so and didn’t inform the minority shareholders what had
happened. Mr. X helped Mr. Purchaser get
the minority shares at a much smaller price per share. The California Court of Appeals holds that
the control premium must be spread out evenly for two reasons: (1) Mr.
Purchaser had originally wanted to tango in an egalitarian way that would have
paid everyone the same per share. (2)
This was botched by Mr. X, who additionally committed fraud in helping get Mr.
Purchaser the rest of the stock at a cheaper price. This case cites <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i> with great approval.</p>

case was from the California Supreme Court: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ahmanson</i>. Mr. Ahmanson lived in <st1:City><st1:place>San
  Diego</st1:place></st1:City>. Sometime
during the 1930’s, he started a stock savings and loan. He was a financial genius and the S &amp; L
did very well. He owned about 80% of the
S &amp; L. It was not publicly traded,
and he wanted a public market so that he and his controlling shareholder
buddies transferred their stock to Newco. That can be done tax-free under Internal Revenue Code § 351. Newco then owned about 80% of the stock S
&amp; L and Newco made an IPO that made Mr. Ahmanson financially liquid as well
as rich. Before this, he was rich, but
his money was tied up in the company. Meanwhile, Ahmanson tried to pick up the minority stock with very
lowball offers. The minority
shareholders generally had enough sense to reject him. They still owned stock only in the S &amp; L
but not Newco. However, the worth of the
S &amp; L was now in the public domain!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A suit was brought and it reached the California Supreme
Court. They discuss <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perlman</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brown v. Halbert</i>. The cause of action could be asserted either
directly, derivatively, or both. Was it
a breach of the fiduciary duty to form the holding company and not let the
minority shareholders in on equal, per share terms? It was held that this was probably so, but
the case was tried below under an erroneous legal standard. The case shall be sent back to the trial
court, which will be told that the controlling shareholder will win if he can
show both of two things: (1) there was a valid, bona fide business purpose for
excluding the minority shareholders, and (2) the purpose could not have been
served by less drastic means. Of course,
he couldn’t prove that. He died, and his
estate settled the suit. Here is where
it gets interesting. For tax purposes,
the Internal Revenue Service often recognizes two important concepts: (1)
minority discount, and (2) control premium. Compute the value of 100% of the stock. Multiply the result by the percent holdings of the minority
shareholder. Apply to that figure a
discount from 15-40% recognizing the minority status.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
appraisal law, they have said no to a minority discount on a closely-held
minority stock interest. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
the situation is unclear. There are
opinions indicating that where it is a closely-held concern, if you elect
appraisal rights, they may apply that. If you buy 8% of a company that is closely-held, then the regulations
will be amended to say that the stock will be redeemed when the buyer dies and
to establish a fair market value “without regard to minority discount”. Why do we put this in the regulations? There are <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>
cases that indicate that this may not happen unless you put this language in
the regulations.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Internal Revenue Service was in dispute with the
Ahmanson estate. He had the controlling
bloc of Newco. Let’s say that Newco
stock was selling at $45 per share. What
does that mean? It is the value of an
atomized 100 share bloc having no real factor in control. That’s why most tender offers are at well
above the NYSE price. They say to
Ahmanson’s estate that a control premium will be added because he has such a
big bloc. According to the newspapers,
the statute of limitations for a refund claim had not run, and they used this
doctrine to get around the control premium! There’s an interconnection here between tax and finance (and “everything
else”). Nobody knows what the current
situation in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> is. Somebody buying will not pay a control
premium, with certain exceptions. They
fear that they may have to pay twice because of these doctrines.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Honigman v. Green
Giant</i> – Why is the Green Giant jolly? Green Giant is a very old company, and the founding family took Class A
stock that on a share-for-share basis was just the same as Class B, except that
Class A carried 1,000 votes per share as opposed to just one vote per
share. Some call this kind of stock
“founders’ stock”. If the company were
liquidated, the Class A stock held by the family would only get about
2-3%. However, they control. The family talked with investment bankers and
proposed this deal: call a shareholders’ meeting to amend the articles, under
which on a ten year basis we can exchange our Class A shares for Class B shares
and get our equity participation increased from 3% to 9%. In other words, they would be paid to be
egalitarian. This proposition was put to
the shareholders. The proxy statement
had full and fair disclosure. There was
overwhelming approval by the Class B holders. Mrs. Honigman was a shareholder in <st1:City><st1:place>Detroit</st1:place></st1:City>
who didn’t like this. She went to <st1:City><st1:place>Milwaukee</st1:place></st1:City>
to bring suit in federal court in a diversity case. She argued that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i> gave her an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inalienable
right</i> to stop this transaction.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The court held “pish tosh”, there is no fraud, no damage to
creditors, no waste, no illegality, full and fair disclosure up-front, and an
overwhelming majority voting for it. Therefore, under the <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
standard, with shareholder blessing, Mrs. Honigman hasn’t a leg to stand
on. She argued that control was a
corporate asset and it ought not be subjected to this kind of waiver. The court laughed at her argument. It is one of the most important cases ever
decided in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i>
chain.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, we
have one provision that you should pay close attention to: R.C. 1701.59(D)
combined with .59(F). .59(D) generally
says: as to duty of care owed by directors to the company, you can’t hold them
liable in money damages unless the plaintiff proves recklessness or
intentionality. We have noted before
that .59(D) doesn’t apply to purely prospective injunction relief. It also doesn’t apply to hardcore conflict of
interest transactions. But many
companies today will have a majority of independent, outside directors. On the other hand, R.C. 1701.59(F) says that
.59(D) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does not apply</i> to a
controlling person acting <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as a
controlling person</i>—the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tomash</i>
analysis. If a company is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>a public company and the independent
outside directors approve the transfer of a controlling bloc of stock to
somebody, then the shield of .59(D) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does
not apply </i>to that transaction. That’s a very important section! If it’s a public company, then that provision of .59(F) doesn’t apply.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two other places where <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i> doesn’t apply. You have an amalgamation. The
acquiring company enters into contracts with many of the controlling persons of
the acquired company. Does this violate
conflict of interest law? Does it
violate <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i>? The answer is pretty well developed in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law: if the employment contracts are reasonable and are fully and fairly
disclosed up-front, there is no problem with the transaction. Why is this the correct resolution, according
to Shipman? In an amalgamation, one of
the first things that the purchasing company wants to button down with either
employment contracts or covenants not to compete is that the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>goodwill</i> will transfer: the controlling
persons won’t turn around and compete with you. The employment contracts or covenants not to compete are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>crucial</i>. If you don’t get them, it can be legal malpractice.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Next, if you look through <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law of the last thirty years, you’ll find that if there is a good reason for
treating the controlling person a little differently from others, it will be
upheld if you can show there is a sound reason for doing it and that it is
reasonable and fully disclosed up-front. Let’s say Smith owns 19% of X, Inc., which is an NYSE company. GM wants to amalgamate X, Inc. into itself in
a statutory merger using its own common stock as the consideration. GM wants to button the deal down as early as
possible, and they talk to Smith and the directors of X, Inc., saying: “Under
R.C. Chapter 1704 and under the poison pill, if the board of directors agrees
to this, we can buy Smith’s stock right now and we’ll buy it for our common
stock using Rule 506. We agree that
within seven months we will cause X, Inc. to be merged into GM for GM common
stock at the same rate that Smith got the stock. If you research <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law, you will find that’s okay. There is
no doubt that it’s okay under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law. Both sides of the transaction will
be tax-free under Internal Revenue Code § 368(A)(1)(a). Generally, acquiring corporation outside of <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State>, they don’t want to chance it and they will
comply with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman</i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ahmanson</i>, and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Brown v. Halbert</i>. Note how
egalitarian these cases are.</p>

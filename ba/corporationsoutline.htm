<b>Not-for-profit corporations<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not-for-profit corporations will not have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shareholders</i>, they will have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>members</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The people who run the not-for-profit will be called <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directors </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>trustees</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Below them will be
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>officers</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Beneath them will be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>non-officer executives</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
below that, you have “the people who actually do the work”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There will be creditors in a not-for-profit
corporation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of §§ 1701 and 1702, they both state the
following: “§ 1701 applies to corporations formed under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>other</i> chapters (e.g. § 1702), except to the extent that § 1702 is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inconsistent</i> with § 1701, in which event
you go to § 1702.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is it always to
determine when there is inconsistency?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Go to § 1702, and you’ll find
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mirror image of that</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It says: “In construing this chapter,
construe it with § 1701, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>except</i> if §
1701 is inconsistent, in which case use this statute.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>specific
trumps the general every time</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The NYSE is organized as a <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
not-for-profit corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All
not-for-profit corporations have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>members</i>
who elect <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directors</i> or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>trustees</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t have shareholders, but they do
have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>creditors</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are two big subdivisions of
not-for-profit corporations:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1)
Charitable, religious, educational and corporations for the prevention of
cruelty to animals – The most favored not-for-profits are those that meet
Internal Revenue Code § 501(c)(3).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To
gain this status, you must file papers with the IRS in advance to convince them
that you’re charitable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One requirement
is that no insider can have an undue right to the income or assets of the
foundation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In practice, that means that
the promoter can be a trustee, director, or president and can collect a
reasonable salary and benefits, including a reasonable salary plan.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some people who run charitable corporations
get good money!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you are a charitable
organization, you’re governed by ordinary state corporation law and also the
law of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charitable trusts</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re a § 1702 charitable corporation,
you’ll be governed by both § 1702 and § 1701 (to the extent that it’s not
inconsistent), and also by the law of charitable trusts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re going to start a charitable
organization, though, do it under § 1702.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you get into a dispute over trust law, you’ll have to go to a
treatise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under § 503(c)(3), you’re
exempt from federal income taxation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You’re also exempt from most federal excise taxes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can also get an exemption from real
property taxes!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that’s not the end
of the financial feast!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under IRC § 170,
within certain percentage limits, donors making donations to you get a federal
income tax deduction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) Non-charitable
not-for-profits – § 503(c)(6) describes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>business
leagues</i>, which provide <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i> tax
breaks, but not nearly as many as if you are a § 501(c)(3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, these
are governed primarily by § 1701.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
promoter wants a vehicle that he can (1) raise money with (to entice inactive
investors to put their money in), (2) can control (the promoter wants to
control the board of directors because it will determine who the officers and
highly paid employees are and who gets the fringe benefits), and (3) if things
go to hell he can minimize his liability (subject to qualified exceptions for
disregard of the corporate fiction; but the inactive investor seldom gets
reached).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Who can be tapped (that is,
who will be liable) if things go wrong?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perpetual warrants</i> out there that

</span>Executive stock options are nearly always <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you die, your beneficiaries get the option

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Officers are very high-level management
employees with a formal legal title: “executive vice president” or

directors are to pass major transactions, to monitor the officers, and to set
long-range plans and policies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
directors are advised by lawyers, CPAs, management consultants, and investment

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Corporate securities determine, among other things, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>who controls</i> (that is, who elects
directors), which in turn controls <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>who
gets the good jobs</i> (since the directors choose the officers), and also what
cash flow will go to the shareholders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The most junior equity (usually common stock) captures the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>upside</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is invariably the common stock that elects directors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes you’ll see voting preferred stock,
but not all that often, so we’ll call common stock the most junior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a company sells its assets and is liquidated and it’s
paying off its security holders, creditors take first, preferred stockholders
take second, and common stockholders take third.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those most junior stockholders will get <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nothing</i> unless the creditors and common
stockholders are satisfied in whole.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On
the other hand, the holder of a fully secured mortgage note (the most senior
debt) is the most protected when the downside comes. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The unsecured creditors, that is, the
creditors with no lien, often take nothing or close to nothing in bankruptcy
because the secured creditors may have placed first mortgages on almost
everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first version of R.C. Chapter 1707 was passed in 1913.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first state statute was in <st1:State><st1:place>Kansas</st1:place></st1:State>
in 1912.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Kansas Secretary of State
that the farmers were being sold “so many pieces of the blue sky”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is why we call state securities statutes
“Blue Sky” statutes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a CCH
“Blue Sky” Reporter. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The state statutes
provide for registration of securities at R.C. 1707.09, which in effect says
that unless exempt, every person must first register every security before you
offer it for sale in that state.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
exemptions in the Ohio Act are found in R.C. 1707.02 and .03.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the Securities Act of 1933 you’ll find the
same stuff in § 3, 4, and 5.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just before
World War I, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state “Blue
Sky” statutes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So R.C. Chapter 1707 has
a “don’t breathe” clause, and then exemptions like .02(E).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A security listed on any major stock exchange or listed on
the national market system of NASDAQ is exempt from registration by
everybody.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there is no comparable
thing in the federal statutes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If GM
makes a public offering, they will have to register just like a startup
company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>But that’s not the end of the
story.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A big public company like GM can
use a shorter registration form and, in fact, their offering will go through
faster than an IPO because the SEC is very aware of GM and its reputation for
high solvency.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Broker-dealers must
register under R.C. 1707.14.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Court cases
have held that if you have more than an incidentally small number of
transactions, you’re <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in the business</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In R.C. 1707.13, there is a substantive fairness
provision.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the commissioner can find
that the securities are to be sold on grossly unfair terms, he can stop
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no similar provision
federally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if you try to register
federally and it’s a real screwjob, then the SEC will delay you forever.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In R.C. 1707.29, .44 and .45 are criminal
provisions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>.44 reads like a regular
high-scienter criminal statute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But .29
says that if you claim that you don’t have scienter because you didn’t have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knowledge</i> but if a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>reasonable investigation</i> would have produced such knowledge, then
you are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>presumed</i> to have known what
you would have learned from a reasonable investigation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, ordinary negligence is the
mens rea!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>R.C. 1707.38-.45 deals with civil
liability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first federal statute was the Securities Act of
1933.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This deals with public offerings
by companies and their <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>affiliates</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That usually includes directors, high
officers, and anyone who is a controlling person.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 deals
more with broker-dealers, stock exchanges, the trading markets and the
NASD.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just what is the NASD?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a Delaware-chartered not-for-profit
company subject to heavy SEC oversight which governs the “over-the-counter”
(that is, not on a stock exchange) markets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The NASD runs <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>quotation systems</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a national market system which is
automated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are also <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other</i> automated systems, the most
prominent being the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bulletin board</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The smaller public companies in <st1:place>Central
 Ohio</st1:place> are found on the bulletin board.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They also have the “sheets”, that used to be
mimeographed, but now they’re more electronic.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Excluding mutual funds, there are only 14,000 public companies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are 8,000 mutual funds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s out of several million business associations
in the country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How did the NYSE come
about?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They started out under a tree,
then they got a building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first question with regard to any federal securities act
is whether it is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>security</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Smith v. Gross</i> –
Here was an entrepreneur selling earthworms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Earlier cases had held that if you buy cattle from an entrepreneur and
he keeps and feeds them for you, then that is an investment contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if you take care of your own cattle they
are not securities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Smith brought a suit
under § 12(a)(1) under the Securities Act of 1933 for rescission.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That statute says that if you should have
registered but didn’t, the investor can rescind and get his money back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, the investor will only rescind
when the stock goes down!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So we have a
suit against the vendor of the earthworms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There was clearly a public offering here and Regulation D was not
complied with.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no registration
statement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, of course, if there is
no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>security</i>, then there is no

<p class=MsoNormal>The company was a very prosperous NYSE company in <st1:City><st1:place>St.
  Louis</st1:place></st1:City> that generally had stock of increasing value
from 1941 on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They could have filed a
short form with the SEC, but they didn’t.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The S-8 is limited to public companies and its employee stock options.<span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What remedy does the SEC seek?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They only want an injunction forcing the
company to file.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>a criminal proceeding.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company picked out employees who they
thought were up and coming, and they offered stock in the company to them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The people who were picked out ranged from
the deck foreman to the President and CEO with a lot inbetween.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a broad group of people.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the 1930’s, the SEC general counsel had
issued his opinion that once you define what the offering is, if the number is
25 or fewer, there will nearly always be an exemption from registration.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the number is 26 or greater, it will not
be a private offering.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court
looked at the legislative history and found a congressional statement saying
that generally speaking, if you make a public offering to employees it’s like a
public offering to anyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court could have gone either of two ways: (1) it could
have accepted the SEC rule of thumb, saying that the company was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>way</i> over the 25 number, and thus there
was no private officer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) It could
have said that the SEC could have its own rule of thumb, but that’s not binding
on the courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The latter is what they
actually said.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The test for determining
whether it’s public or not is the “needs to be served” test.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the people <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>need</i> the protections of a registration statement (which will
contain a prospectus) then whether it is to few or many offerees, it’s a public
officer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justice Clark tried to get more
specific, saying that if the offering were limited to people who could “fend
for themselves” and all of those people have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>access </i>(emphasis on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>access</i>)
to information that a registration statement would provide, then it is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-public</i> regardless of the numbers
involved.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, in this particular
case, had the offering been limited to the ten top officers in <st1:City><st1:place>St.
  Louis</st1:place></st1:City>, it would have been fine because those ten
people can “fend for themselves” and they had access to the information that a
statement could provide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Wall Street law firms interpreted the case as saying
that we can go further if Chrysler wants to sell its 5 year notes to the 150
biggest banks in the country, they put together a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>private placement memorandum </i>containing the essential financial,
accounting, and narrative statements and they hold a meeting giving top
representatives from those banks access to management to ask questions, then
even though there are 150 offerees then it’s private.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s the only good news from this case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Justice Clark’s last point was that the burden of pleading
and proving an exemption is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>totally</i>
upon the proponent of the exemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s also true in R.C. 1707.38-.45.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Later Fifth Circuit cases made it clear that the proponent of the
exemption had to come into court with the list of the exact names of every
offeree and further proof that nobody else was approached and show that each of
those met the “needs to be served” test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Those Fifth Circuit cases were <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>awful</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ralton Purina</i>
established, among other things, that with all exemptions the burden of
pleading and proof in every detailed respect falls upon the claimant of the
exemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>R.C. 1707.38-.45 establishes
the same thing in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both federally and in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
the fact that you’re exempt from registration doesn’t exempt you from <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>express</i> civil liabilities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For example, R.C. 1707.38-.45 apply equally as to registered
transactions as they do to exempt transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>State law is often more demanding than federal law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, R.C. 1707.29 and .44-.45, in a
criminal case, make a defendant far more vulnerable than in a federal criminal
prosecution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The major case on the
subject is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>State v. Warner</i> out of the
Ohio Supreme Court from the 1980’s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
court held that R.C. 1707.29 means what it says: the mens rea element in a
criminal prosecution under R.C. 1707.29 is simply <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ordinary negligence</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Federally, the mens rea element is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>willfulness</i>,
which has been construed as a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very high
burden</i> on the federal government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How much does federal law preempt state law?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The short answer is some but not much.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the 1990’s, there were three big federal
statutes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First, in 1996, there was
NSMIA, or the National Securities Markets Improvements Act.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This Act has several preemptive
provisions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As to investment advisors,
the federal government takes over primary regulation of the big ones and the
states take over primary regulation of the little ones.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a result, in the 1990’s, <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
passed an investment advisors act that covers financial planners.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>NSMIA also says that if a company is listed
on a major exchange or on the national market system of the NASD, no state can
require registration of the issuance of securities by that company.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It reads just like R.C. 1707.02(E) in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before this federal Act, several states like <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>
did not exempt nationally-listed corporations from registration.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Only the state of incorporation can deal with
alleged securities and fiduciary duty violations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As to mutual funds, certain things were
reserved to the SEC, while the states can do certain other things.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’ll later discuss the provision dealing
with Rule 506.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1998, an act was passed that says with respect to certain
fraud and other suits they will become subject to the 1995 federal act (which
was very pro-defendant).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they are in
state court, they are to be removed to federal court where the defendant
advantages of the 1995 Act apply.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
is a big exception, though.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In an action
for breach of fiduciary duty under the law of the state of incorporation, the
1998 Act doesn’t apply, and if the plaintiff’s lawyer is careful in drafting,
you can avoid the 1995 Act.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>CTS</i> from the U.S. Supreme Court in the
1980’s, the Court said that regulation of tender offers by the states must be
reasonable and limited and if they are not reasonable and limited then they
will be preempted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So there is some federal preemption but not a heck of a
lot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Common law remedies are not
displaced by federal or state securities laws and are the best more often than
you think!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Under the federal securities
laws, a securities broker must avoid recommending unsuitable securities to
purchasers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a remedy under Rule
10(b)(5).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under 10(b)(5), it is only if
the customer proves that the recommendation was made with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>scienter</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s
hardcore.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a big <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
case, a NYSE member broker-dealer recommended some investments to a customer,
and they went south.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The customer said
that given his precarious financial position, they should not have recommended
a speculative security.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If he had sued
under 10(b)(5), it would have had to go to federal court because the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 says that all actions under the Act must be in federal
court (which is different from the other federal securities statutes).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The plaintiff argued that Olde &amp; Co. is a member of the
NYSE and that one of the rules of the NYSE says that every member must “know
thy customer”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The primary purpose of
the rule is to protect the member firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If a customer doesn’t buy up after he buys, the member firm is
responsible to the party on the other side of the transaction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court held that under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
common law this created a statutory tort for a negligent failure to observe
suitability, and the plaintiff won!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shipman says that the plaintiff’s attorneys were very smart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cases like this will usually go to arbitration.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Usually, broker-dealers will force customers
to sign arbitration clauses up front, and usually the broker-dealer insists on
arbitration.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We don’t know why they
didn’t do so here!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In arbitration,
suitability claims under 10(b)(5) require scienter, at least in theory.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But in practice, arbitrators will often give
recovery for mere <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>negligence</i> on the
part of the broker-dealer firm regarding suitability.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, studies of all massive
arbitration system, like the securities system, indicate that arbitrators tend
not to give lavish or large awards.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
cut down on the amount.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’re more
liberal in giving the plaintiff <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>something</i>,
but the dollar amounts are smaller.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Some examples of
exemptions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Around 93% of all transactions are exempt.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s go over some of the important
ones.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§ 4(1) says that if you’re not an
issuer or an underwriter or an affiliate of the company, stock which you
purchase through the organized trading markets will be exempt.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, I’m contacted by Johnson in <st1:City><st1:place>Dayton</st1:place></st1:City>
who is a physician.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Three months ago, he
bought GM stock, registered in his own name, through the NYSE.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He is not a director or officer of GM.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Neither is his wife or any other
relative.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He doesn’t meet the 10% rule,
which is the third way you can be an affiliate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you add up the GM stock all of his family owns, it’s still well under
10% of the shares outstanding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Insofar
as the Securities Act of 1933 is concerned, he has a § 4(1) exemption.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Insofar as <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law is concerned, R.C. 1707.02(E) exempts him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>To sell the stock, he will have to sell it through a broker, but he had
to have a brokerage account in order to buy the stock in the first place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are an affiliate as defined in Rule 405, you must
construe § 4(1) with § 2(11), which gets tricky.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>2(11) defines “underwriter” in terms of a
person taking with a view to distribution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>United States v. Wolfson</i>
out of the Second Circuit, the court held that in a criminal case the last
sentence of § 2(11) applies not only to the first sentence of § 2(11) but also
to § 4(1), meaning that an affiliate owning stock can sell only in one of only
three ways: (1) The company files a registration statement for him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This happens only once in 10,000 times because
it’s very expensive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) As to public
companies, Rule 144 provides a limited, specified exemption that is widely
used.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) He can make a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-distribution</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Look at 2(11)’s first sentence, and you’ll
find the word “distribution”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The SEC
concedes that if an affiliate makes a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-distribution</i>,
4(1) applies to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An affiliate can sell under Rule 144 on the stock exchange
(but there’s a lot of paperwork).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
will get market price for his stock on the exchange.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He can legally make a non-distribution in
theory?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The SEC says that the term
“distribution” in § 2(11) equals “non-public offering” in § 4(2) as defined by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ralston Purina</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He could sell the stock to a big mutual fund
with a legend saying that the taker is buying for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>investment</i> and not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>distribution</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The taker cannot sell for one year.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there is full and fair disclosure to the
mutual fund up-front, that would be perfectly legal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, he won’t do that because he’ll have
to sell at a 15-40% discount.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So he’ll
go to the internal general counsel to get the paperwork going to sell and he’ll
sell under Rule 144 at the full market price.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So to construe § 4(1) you must construe it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>with</i> § 2(11), <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>United States
v. Wolfson</i>, and Rule 144.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This accounts for the fact that in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, many major investors elect <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> to sit on the board of a company
that they own a lot of stock in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they
sit on the board of the company, they will be subject to the restrictions of
Rule 144 and Rule 10(b)(5).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other
hand, let’s say a rich guy in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
wants to buy 4.5% of GM.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He can go to
his bank and the bank can purchase in “street name”, and as long as he stays
under 5%, he doesn’t even have to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>surface</i>
under 13(d).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He will prefer to remain
anonymous because if that is his only connection to GM and his family owns no
GM stock and he acquired the stock over one year ago on the NYSE, then he can
sell it at any time!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If, on the other
hand, he’s on the board, he has all the Rule 144 limits plus, if there is material,
undisclosed and unfavorable information about the company, 10(b)(5) absolutely
precludes him from selling.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>,
the big companies all have the big investors on their board.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But in this country, a lot of the people who
are big investors prefer to stay off the board.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As long as they’re under 10% including family holdings and as long as
they don’t seek out or get inside info, they can sell when they want to and
they can buy when they want to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another person that cannot use § 4(1) is someone who has
purchased stock in an exemption and sells before it has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>come to rest</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is why
under Regulation D securities sold under that exemption must be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>legended</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the public trading markets, delivery to
your broker of a legended security is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per
se</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bad delivery</i>!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, if you buy in a 506 offering and
get legended securities, then even if the company is a public company you’ll be
unable to sell the securities until you get the company to issue you a
“squeaky-clean” certificate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Can a person be both an affiliate and also not meet the
“come to rest” period?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the “come to rest” period?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At common law, it is two years.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>United
States v. Sherwood</i> out of the Southern District of New York in the 1950’s,
under Rule 144 for a public company the period is cut to one year.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Public companies are treated better under the
securities laws in about eight ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The SEC introduction to Regulation D talks about “come to

“mom and pop” exemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This exemption
cannot be used by a public company or investment company.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a dollar limit of $1,000,000.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under all of Regulation D, there can be no <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general advertising</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The same is true under § 4(2).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
entrepreneur and you’re getting in the car and dropping in on 80 bankers that
you don’t know, that would be construed as general advertising.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is Rule 504 a 4(2) rule?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That is, is it adopted under 4(2)?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No, it’s adopted under § 3(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 which gives
the commission power to adopt exemptions for (1) private offerings and (2)

in the main, on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purchasers</i>, who you
can more easily keep account of.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under
504, there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no limit</i> on the

to pure debt?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Look for the .02

.02, saying that if something is a pure debt security and if it would meet
.03(O) if it were an equity security then it will meet <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

</span>Another set of <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
regulations that are crucial are the regulations under .03(V).<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Federally, Rules 701-703T of the Securities Act of 1933
provide a similar exemption for non-public companies up to a certain dollar
limit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The rules under 701-703T say that

options and purchase plans are a lot more valuable for public companies than
for private companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Beginning 25
years ago, executives could make tens of millions of dollars through these
plans.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the 1990’s, this expanded to

<p class=MsoNormal>From 1913-1960, the almost invariable rule where you had a
corporation was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>double taxation</i>,
meaning: (1) the corporation itself is subject to tax, and (2) when the income
is paid over (the dividend), they are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>again
</i>subject to tax, and (3) when the corporation dissolves and distributes its
assets to shareholders, there is a tax at the corporate level on the difference
between the fair market value of assets and what the company paid for them <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> there is a further tax at the
shareholder level on the difference between what the shareholder paid for the
stock and the value that he received.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first exception came in 1942 for mutual funds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the late 1950’s and early 1960’s, a
similar deal was put in for Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s an odd statute.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It says that if you’re a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>trust</i> taxable as a corporation and you make the election, it is
similar to mutual funds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you pay out
a certain percent of your income each year (something like 95%), then as to
what is paid out, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i> aren’t taxed on
it; only the recipient shareholders are taxed on it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>REITs haven’t had as great a run as mutual
funds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman speculates that the

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the same time, a huge amendment to the Internal Revenue
Code, Subchapter C came into being.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
is the general subchapter governing corporations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All the rules in this section are double and
triple taxation!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you meet the
requirements and make the election properly, you are governed mainly by
Subchapter S.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But where Subchapter S
doesn’t deal with an issue, you go back to Subchapter C.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sub S is a bit different than the mutual fund
situation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How many companies can
elect?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It must be a <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> corporation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It can have no more than a certain number of
shareholders (75 as of the last edition of the book).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No shareholder can be a partnership,
corporation, or ordinary trust.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
are limits on the extent to which non-resident aliens can own stock in the Sub
S company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Making and keeping this election is complicated!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It requires a lawyer because what you have to
have is a shareholders’ agreement under O.R.C. § 1701.591 to restrict the
transfers of shares and require election of consent by everybody who gets the
shares.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The board of directors files the
consent with the Internal Revenue Service, but they have to have consents from
all shareholders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a two-level
proposition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re only dealing with
one or two shareholders, it’s pretty simple, but if you’re dealing with 45,
it’s going to get complicated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the election is made, the situation is about 70% like
that of a general partnership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tax
lawyers describe this as “flow-through taxation”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means that the corporation files a
return, but it’s an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>information return </i>as
to income taxes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As to taxes other than
income taxes, it’s fully subject, just like GM: excise taxes, sales taxes, real
estate taxes, corporate franchise taxes and so on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But they file a return, and then at the end
of the year they inform each shareholder of his or her share of the net income
or net loss for the year and the shareholders include it in their income just
like in a partnership (in a way).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
company <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>keeps</i> all the income, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>it’s still taxable to the shareholders
currently</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s one of the reasons
why you must have a § 1701.591 agreement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You want to require, say, half of earnings to be paid out because the
shareholders have to pay state, city, and federal income taxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suppose the company makes $1 million in year one, has one
shareholder, and pays nothing out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
company pays no tax, but the shareholder is subject to tax on $1 million,
absent a R.C. 1701.591 agreement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
shareholder is Bill Gates, it’s no biggie since Gates is worth $50
billion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But for most people, it’s a big
deal!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Suppose that in year two, that
money is paid out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s called <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>previously taxed income</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the company broke even in year two but
gave a $1 million check to the guy, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>he
wouldn’t pay any tax on that</i>, because it would be previously taxed
income.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most states now allow this, but <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
did not until about 20 years ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us compare Sub S to the new kid on the block from Sub
K-land: the LLC!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First of all, you can
have an LLC if you “check the box”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
can have an LLC with Sub K treatment even if a corporation, a trust, a partnership
or a non-resident alien is a member of the LLC!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Furthermore, the numbers can exceed the 75 specified shareholders in Sub
S.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is an upper limit, and it comes
in a “back-handed” way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>current tax law</i>, no new Sub K entity can
have securities traded on a public market.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We will discover that two sections of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, §§ 15(d) and 12(g)(1), will cause (1) an entity that makes a registered
public offering under the Act of 1933(?) or (2) any entity with 500 or more
holders to file public periodic reports with the SEC.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With those reports, under Rule 15c2-11 of the
1934 Act, a public market <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> be made
by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> broker-dealer in the country
on that stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition, under §§
12(a) and (b) of the 1934 Act, if you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>voluntarily</i>
list any security on a national securities exchange there is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se</i> a public market in that
security.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, as a practical
matter, you have to work with a securities lawyer and avoid these four sections
of the Act.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a back-handed
limitation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Grandfathered in are a few
old limited partnerships from the 1980s that are listed on a couple of
exchanges: these are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>master limited
partnerships</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were cut off a
few years ago, but there are a few hanging around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LLCs have another use: they are widely used for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mineral interests </i>held by entrepreneurs,
for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>real estate</i> held by a real estate
investor, and for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intellectual property</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are widely used for two reasons: (1)
Wealthy people will often leave property in trust to a bank to manage for their
family.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The big banks and trust
companies want investment property given to them to manage in trust to be in
corporate form or LLC form in order to minimize their potential liability.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the LLC goes bankrupt, they’re unlikely to
get stuck.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) Very often you’ll have
two or more entrepreneurs come together, each contributing some assets.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After a few years, each one often wants to
pull their own contribution out and go their own way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have a corporation, even a Sub S
corporation, there will be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tax </i>on
“phantom income” at the corporation level, measured by the difference between
the cost of the assets and the current fair market value.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re in a Sub K situation, however, very
often the split will be tax free to the LLC <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
tax free to the member taking back what he contributed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He’ll simply take over the LLC’s basis and
move forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>caution</i>: don’t
ever put publicly traded securities in a Sub K entity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a tax trap there!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are three better ways to do this: (1)
With publicly traded securities, put it in a revocable trust.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you do it right, contributions to the
trust and the unraveling of it will be tax free.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) Another option is a managing agency
account with a big bank.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the name implies,
there’s no trust, there’s no entity, although the stock will be in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>name</i> of the bank, it is a simple
managing agency account and there is no consequence in setting it up, and you
have the right to revoke it at any time and they will register the stock in
your name and return it to you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3)
Finally, the third way to go is a street name account at a big brokerage
house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They call it this because they’ll
hold the stock in the name of their own “nominees” (some of their senior
executives).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That makes trading a lot
easier.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you need it back at any time,
they’ll deliver the securities to you.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

there was a big “hiccup” along the way!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Ohio Supreme Court ruled that (1) the legislature could not
legislate concerning the governance of lawyers in this way, (2) only a Supreme

allow it, but only if there was a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charter

federal and state, they were treated as common law employees.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you excluded these four or five people,
there weren’t 15 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>employees</i>, and the
company moved at summary judgment for exclusion from the statute.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That issue, in the Second Circuit, had been
resolved against the shareholder/employees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They held that if you choose the corporate form, the fact that you’re a
shareholder, and even a majority shareholder and a director doesn’t affect the
fact that if you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>work</i> full-time for
the company, then you are an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>employee</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Out west, one of the courts held just the
opposite: it’s a small, intimate, professional corporation.<span

employees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
this case would go against the doctors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stevens, for the majority, says that he will remand the case
so that the Court of Appeals can apply his opinion.<span

work for the company and who have such <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>large</i>

</span>It’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cannot be fired test</i>!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a single doctor incorporated, and he was
the sole director, the president, and the sole medical employee, then no one
could fire him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Second Circuit, or <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,

</span>You get national uniformity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Stevens discusses the 12-14 items you look at to determine if a person
is a servant-agent, and he says that will apply.<span

the letter and then defend you, they are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>estopped</i>
from affirming the exclusions or lack of coverage later.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>About one time in ten after the reservation

</span>Why is this done?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the old

the lawyer employed by the insurance company to represent the insured owned <i

insured.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And if it’s through
confidential attorney-client conversation that the attorney learns of the

</span>(1) negligence, (2) fiduciary duty, (3) fraud, and (4) a <i

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Supreme Court of Minnesota and the lower court agreed
that there was no cause of action alleged in common law negligence or common
law fraud because for any tort, you must plead and prove an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual legal injury</i>, that is, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>damages</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Consider the general fiduciary duty claim: you must plead and prove some

damages are enough.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next, we came to the
fraud exclusion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court held that
there are two types of fraud: (1) actual legal fraud with scienter, and (2) <i

normal'>equitable</i> fraud between the fiduciary and the beneficiary of the
relationship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, they held that the
second type of fraud, which is basically <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unfairness</i>,
does not trigger the fraud exclusion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
the fraud doesn’t apply.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the
coverage clause cover the refund of fees?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They said yes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They follow the
maxim that insurance policies are construed, when reasonable to do so, to
benefit the insured.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The coverages are

executions are construed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>narrowly</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about the public policy arguments?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As to the firm itself, its ability to refund
is based entirely on respondeat superior.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The firm did not tell Perl to do what he did, and they didn’t ratify
what he did.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, coverage of Perl, the
actor, is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>against public policy</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When an insurance company covers both
principal and agent, principal cannot recover from the agent when the principal
has to pay off to a third party.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But,
the court says, the result here is $20,000 to the plaintiff, to be paid by the
insurance company on behalf of the firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How do we equalize with Perl?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
answer is that when the insurance company pays off on behalf of the law firm to
the plaintiff, they’re subrogated to her rights.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, they are subrogated to the rights of
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>firm</i> against Mr. Perl.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, the insurance company will cut a
check to the plaintiff and then, on remand, the trial court is going to enter a

$20,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zahn v. Transamerica</i>
– Here are the three big holdings of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Transamerica</i>:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) Controlling shareholders have very high
fiduciary duty to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> the
corporation and to minority shareholders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Anybody who litigates knows that if you’re representing a plaintiff and
you can prove a high fiduciary duty on the part of the defendants, you’re a
long way toward home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) This holding
is more by the district court than the Court of Appeals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district judge reminded the Court of
Appeals (“ever so delicately”) that even if there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>total </i>conflict of interest in the corporate arena, and even if it
is severe, if the fiduciary can show <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overall
reasonableness </i>as to disclosure up front and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>overall reasonableness</i> on the merits, and no harm to creditors,
then the transaction will stand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this
particular case, there was no injury to creditors because all the creditors
were paid off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a failure in
disclosure here that led to the 1:1 instead of 2:1 splitting of tobacco
inventory.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) Disclosure was also
violated in this case under SEC § 10(b) and rule 10b-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The court read the charter: the label preferred stock (Class
A) could be called by the corporation at a certain rate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Class B shares were a lot more
complicated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is the declaration and
payment of dividends <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mandatory</i>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this case, the answer was no.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do we know this?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dividends were “when, as, and if
declared”, and this was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-mandatory</i>
language.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can you have mandatory
preferred stock as to dividends, though?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Generally, you can’t because the board of the directors and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only</i> the board determines whether
dividends are paid (with certain exceptions to be developed later).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One exception is that when you have a
closely-held corporation where all the shareholders have signed a § 1701.591
agreement and the creditors aren’t hurt by the agreement, then that agreement
can provide for mandatory dividends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is the dividend cumulative?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That is, if, in a given year, the directors don’t declare dividends on
preferred stock, do the directors <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ultimately</i>
have to pay it?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The footnotes of this
case say that the drafter made sure it was cumulative by saying: “if they don’t
declare in a year, they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shall accumulate</i>”
and “if any dividends <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>have</i> been
passed, the common stockholders can’t get a penny until any accumulated
dividends are paid”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is a preferred
stock <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>participating</i>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today, you seldom see participating preferred
stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this Class B stock <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is </i>participating.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once the board pays the annual dividend on
the Class B, the rest of what’s left is split between the Class B and the
common stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Class B gets two bites at
the apple!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do you make a preferred <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-participating</i>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You use the phrase “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and no more</i>” after the words “dividend of $X, when, as, and if
declared by the board of directors”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is the stock callable?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>To make a stock callable, it requires special language.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The language is here: the stock can be called
at par plus accrued unpaid dividends.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A
call provision is always for the benefit of the most <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>junior</i> security, that is, common stock, because it puts a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cap</i> on what the more <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>senior</i> security can take.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is the stock convertible?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This takes special language too.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Class B in this case could go into the common
stock, but only 1:1, and they give up their accrued, undeclared dividends.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the preferred stock have a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>put</i>?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A put is an option whereby the holder of the option can <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>force someone else</i> to buy at a
stipulated price or under a stipulated formula (like fair market value, for
example).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Court of Appeals held that because all of the directors
of Axton-Fisher were officers or directors of Transamerica, there was an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overarching</i> conflict of interest, and
the board of Axton-Fisher could not call the preferred stock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The district judge says to the Court of
Appeals that they got it all wrong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
district judge says that the overriding rule of law is that even if there is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>complete </i>conflict of interest, if the
fiduciary shows overall fairness as to disclosure up front and on the merits,
and creditors are not injured, then there is always a complete defense in the
corporate world against conflict of interest transactions (but in the trust
world, this isn’t necessarily true).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the district judge says that the call provision is for
the benefit of the common stock, and the conversion provision is for the
benefit of the holders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>T<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hen</i>, this judge looks at Rule 10b-5 and
says that to compute damages, let’s assume the board of Axton-Fisher did it
right, in which case they would have called the Class B.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, if under Rule 10b-5 they should have
informed the Class B holders of what was going on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Class B, having been informed of that,
all would have converted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, the
judge says to the B holders that they should get 1:1, not 2:1.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman says that this is right!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The terms of securities, including debt
securities, are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>everything</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have about the same disclosure duty under state law
that you would have under 10b-5, and the disclosure duty under state law is on
a fiduciary basis, then you plead the matter today under state law rather than
under Rule 10b-5.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How come?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) 10b-5 always requires scienter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under state law, if there is a heavy
fiduciary duty, mere negligence, without any scienter at all, may well
suffice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s easier to prove negligence
than fraud in either federal or state court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(2) In the 1990’s, there were three federal statutes that cut way back
on 10b-5 class actions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>More on these
statutes later in the course.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These statutes
are “plaintiff killing fields”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you
can avoid them, do so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They apply to
class actions for fraud.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, if
you go under state law theories that don’t require fraud to be proved, then you
avoid them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) In the last 25 years,
about half of the federal judges have become more anti-plaintiff in the
corporate area to some degree.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the
state level, it’s a more even playing field.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Even with class action suits, often you stick with the simpler state law
theories rather than going to <st1:State><st1:place>Washington</st1:place></st1:State>
or to the federal courthouse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
very pragmatic but true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case is
very important!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Master this case!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Frick v. Howard</i> –
This case deals with the fiduciary duty aspect of the promoter’s liability
doctrine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since the promoter took a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-negotiable</i> note and assigned it to
the plaintiff, the plaintiff took over all of the disabilities of the assignor
and because he couldn’t meet any one of the three <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>validating tests</i>, he stood in the shoes of the promoter and his
claim for secured status was denied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this case, the promoter is a lawyer who thinks that the
town needs a motel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He buys land for
about $200,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He probably disclosed
that he would transfer the land to a corporation that would run the hotel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today, he would have to negotiate with the S
&amp; L because usually it would put a “due upon sale” clause in the first
mortgage note, and unless they consent to the transaction, they could
accelerate the note and cause it to come due.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> a consumer
transaction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are no federal consumer
statutes involved.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone is a
business, not a consumer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawyer ups
the value, in his own mind, to $310,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The lawyer takes back roughly a $110,000 second mortgage <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>note</i>, plus a second mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a mortgage, there are always <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>two instruments</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a note, which is the in personam

property interest that you record at the courthouse giving you the right to
foreclose if the principal and interest payments aren’t made.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a rank real estate promotion, meaning that it is a

</span>This is the opposite end of the world from the highly secure Exxon!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A big danger for highly leveraged companies
is that they will go insolvent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do
the courts deal with insolvent corporations?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They do it in two ways:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) The
insolvent person can file a voluntary state court receivership or it can be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>involuntary</i> by creditors forcing the
insolvent into the state court receivership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(2) The insolvent person, at the front end, has the option of going
under the Federal Bankruptcy Code of 1978, found at 11 U.S.C., and they can file
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>voluntary</i> petition of
bankruptcy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, initially the
creditors could have filed an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>involuntary</i>
petition in bankruptcy, and a third possibility is that once a state court
receivership is filed, the creditors can force it to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
a unit <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>of</i> the U.S. District Court
with its own clerk and its own judges.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is reviewed by the U.S. District Court, and a district court judge
can take charge of a proceeding at the beginning if they’d like.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The creditor sign and file, on time, formal claims asking
for a “piece of the pie”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s the same
way in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
district court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The $110,000 note, which was originally payable to the
promoter (the lawyer), who was the 100% shareholder, had been <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>assigned</i> by him to the plaintiff.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiff had filed a secured claim in
the state court receivership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He says:
“I have a good $110,000 face amount claim, plus interest, as a secured creditor
in this proceeding!”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court, acting <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sua sponte</i>, started this proceeding to
determine whether this guy had a valid claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what does the court hold?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>First, a note, if it is worded as “pay to X or pay to the order of X”
will usually be a negotiable instrument under Uniform Commercial Code Article
III.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this note lacked this
language.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It simply said: “pay to
X”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawyer assigned it to his buddy
for lots of cash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court holds
that:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) The note is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>a negotiable instrument under
Article III of the Uniform Commercial Code.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were</i>, the holder of that
note could be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>holder in due course</i> and
have greater rights than his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>transferor</i>
had.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s kind of like the Recording
Acts in Property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But since the words of
negotiability were missing, it was a simple, straightforward assignment and the
lawyer’s buddy stepped into the shoes of the lawyer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is, every infirmity that the lawyer
suffered under, the buddy will also suffer under.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) Just what kind of infirmities was the
lawyer under?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawyer was a promoter,
and he owed very high fiduciary duties to the corporation and to the other shareholder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When he sells property to the corporation, in order for that
to stand up, he must do one of two things: (1) he must prove <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overall fairness</i> of disclosure and the
substantive price and that creditors aren’t injured.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Did the assignee of the promoter prove that
as to the promoter?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) The promoter can only put people on the
board of directors who are independent, outside directors who are not beholden
to him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they approve, it will be
tested under the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Business Judgment Rule</i>,
a rule of deference.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is, if they
approve it, it will stand <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless</i> the
other party shows fraud, arbitrary action, ultra vires (beyond the powers),
illegality, waste (meaning recklessness) and then the biggies: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gross</i> negligence in procedure, or gross
negligence on the merits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The last two
are usually the easiest to prove.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Did
the lawyer’s assignee meet the Business Judgment Rule?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, because there wasn’t an independent Board
of Directors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) If all shareholders
and all present and future creditors consent after full and fair disclosure up
front, that would be another “out”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Did
the buddy qualify for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> of these
three “outs”?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the infirmities of the lawyer carry over
to him!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you endorse an instrument to transfer, you have
secondary liability unless you write after that endorsement “without
recourse”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawyer didn’t want that
secondary liability!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are also
certain warranties under Article III whether it would be applicable or
not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawyer probably wrote “W/R and
without warranties”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What the lawyer did
here was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very dangerous</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawyer probably had a duty to tell the
purchaser that this was a non-negotiable note, subject to all the promoter’s
claims.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Careful lawyers, when drafting a
non-negotiable note, will include the caption: “Non-negotiable note”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There’s a case in the last thirty years that says that a lawyer who
wasn’t thinking about it but created a non-negotiable note was liable to a
remote purchaser who didn’t know it was a non-negotiable note.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Are non-negotiable notes something you should
use at times?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sure they are!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re a manufacturer buying 300,000 parts
from someone, then if you give your non-negotiable note and the parts are defective,
then if they guy sues you on the note, you can set-off.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be the same as if the guy sold the
note to a bank.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if you make the note
negotiable, then the note can be sold to a third party, like a bank.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the bank sues you on the note, you can’t
set-off the defective parts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman

cases<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>– What’s the situation?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The promoters formed the corporation and each
of the promoters got stock in the corporation for $5.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Soon after that, the corporation issues stock
to the public and charges the public $15 per share.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was not alleged that there was any fraud
in either sale of stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore,
there is no injury to creditors alleged.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s because the company is
receiving money for stock and upon liquidation, stockholders take last after

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here are four flavors of action.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’re related, but different.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First, consider legal actions on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>behalf</i> of the corporation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The easiest one is the case of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Frick v. Howard</i>, where a company goes
insolvent and there is either a voluntary or involuntary state court
receivership <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>or</i> a trustee in
bankruptcy (“T/B”) who is appointed in a bankruptcy action in the United States
Bankruptcy Court under 11 U.S.C.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>State
court receiverships are quite complicated, and federal actions are even more
so!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These are called <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>universal successors</i> to all of the
assets and causes of action of the corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The state court receiver or trustee in bankruptcy can do two things: (1)
they can assert any causes of action on behalf of the corporation that the corporation
has.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The benefit of these causes of
action ultimately goes to the creditors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(2) The <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
bankruptcy judge or state court receiver has jurisdiction to pass on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>claims</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They must be filed correctly and in a timely manner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And the court for any good equitable or legal
reason can disallow claims or “push them down in the pecking order”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Frick</i>,
the court says that if the claim was refilled as an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>unsecured</i> creditor’s claim, there might be a chance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the unsecured creditors sit at the bottom
of the pecking order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next up, we have shareholder derivative actions, governed by
Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A shareholder files a complaint, served it on
the corporation and the actual defendants, alleging that the defendants have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overreached</i> the corporation in some
way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The shareholder goes on to allege
that the corporation <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>should</i> sue, but
it hasn’t because the defendants <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dominate
the corporation</i> and they won’t sue themselves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, the shareholder wants to sue <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on behalf of the corporation</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the court approves this (after a whole
bunch of motions before the answer), then the suit is tried.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the plaintiff gets a judgment, the
attorney for the plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees and there is notice and
opportunity for hearing on the attorney’s fees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then the attorney for the plaintiff takes off the top.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These actions are driven by plaintiffs’
lawyers!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s left after that goes to
the corporation and the judgment is res judicata as to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all </i>shareholders (not just the suing plaintiffs), the corporation,
and all defendants.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>true </i>true class action” because no
plaintiff can opt out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What the judge
says is res judicata as to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>everybody</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is powerful stuff!!!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the defendants win, it’s also res judicata
as to everybody (they walk away scot-free).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are two other possibilities: (1) settlement, or (2)
dismissal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under Rule 23.1, these are
possible only after the court orders a hearing and determines that it’s to
everyone’s benefit to approve the settlement or dismissal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Any settlement will contain extensive
provisions for the attorneys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Matsushita</i>, you
had a friendly tender offer for a movie studio by a Japanese company.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a good cash tender offer at a good
price.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The family that owned the
controlling stake in the company didn’t like the fact that it was in cash
because they would have to pay taxes on it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They went to the offeror and asked to have them pay with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stock</i> instead of cash.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They agreed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But the problem was that two SEC rules were violated (14d-10 and
10b-13)!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the deal closed, a class
action in the federal district court in <st1:City><st1:place>Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:City>
started up under federal law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But then
there was also a parallel action out of <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
state court under <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
courts couldn’t hear the SEC issues!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
parties settled in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The defendants took the settlement from <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
to <st1:City><st1:place>Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:City> and claimed res
judicata.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Let my defendants go!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which held
that as long as the hearing on settlement meets the Fourteenth and Fifth
Amendments, then a settlement in a state court can cover both the state action <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> related federal action.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it wasn’t all over yet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case went back to <st1:City><st1:place>Los
  Angeles</st1:place></st1:City> and a panel of the Ninth Circuit found that
Justice Thomas, writing for a 9-0 Court, “didn’t really mean what he
said”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a rehearing en banc
before all the Circuit judges and the full court overturned the panel!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The upshot of the case is that some
defendants love class actions because they love early settlements.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note, however, that those people who opted
out of the federal and state actions could proceed on their own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There can be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>direct
action </i>by shareholders against the corporation or its fiduciaries.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there is an ultra vires action, the action
can be asserted derivatively or directly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The lawyer will always choose direct because Rule 23.1 is a “plaintiff’s
killing field”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Similarly, like an
action to force declaration of a dividend, can be asserted by either a class
action of shareholders against a corporation or a single shareholder.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiff’s lawyer will make his decision
based on what’s likely to get better attorney’s fees.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s just how it is!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Massachusetts <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old
Dominion</i> case, which dealt with a few of the promoters, it was said that the
public selling price determined the value of the shares, and the promoters must
pay the company the difference between $5 and $15 times the number of shares
purchased.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the federal <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old Dominion</i> case, written by Holmes, it
was said that one of the exceptions to conflict of interest regulations applied
here because (1) there was no injury to creditors, (2) no fraud or information
deficiency was alleged, and (3) there was consent of all shareholders.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That creates a defense to conflict of
interest?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How did the <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old Dominion</i> case distinguish
Holmes’s opinion?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They said that at the
time of the promotion a public offering was contemplated and that the low price
of the promoters was not put in the perspective, and so there was no unanimous
consent of all shareholders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rule 10b-5 says that when a promoter buys stock, for the
next five years, whenever the corporation issues stock to other people,
publicly or privately, you must disclose that (this is the “five year”
rule).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, today, the promoters in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old Dominion</i> would have put a paragraph
in the offering circular that disclosed the stock holdings of the
promoters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They would have disclosed
that the promoters paid $5 per share even though they were asking $15 per share
from the public.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You must do this or
risk violating federal and state securities laws!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the promoters had followed the SEC
disclosure laws, then there will be unanimous shareholder approval, no harm to
creditors (because it’s beneath the creditors), no informational deficiency,
and no fraud.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Put it all together, and
you get one of the exceptions to liability under conflict of interest
regulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, if people are aware of SEC disclosure rules, and other
those rules these cases are irrelevant, why are these cases important?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s all about compensating the promoter and
compensating <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sweat equity</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today, the offering circular to the public
would fully disclose the $5 price.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Generally, for tax purposes, if the promoters organize for $5 and then
you go to the public at $15, within two years of when you do it, the IRS will
say to the promoters: “You have $10 per share of ordinary income!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Pay up!”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If it’s over two years, the tax cases say that it is clear that the
promotion was “old and cold”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what is the lesson of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old
Dominion</i>?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to find the true
value of stock as applicable to the marriage, business-wise, of sweat-equity
and capitalists.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s start a new
business!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We need $1 million.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a capitalist who has that much cash,
but he needs someone to run the company on a day-to-day business.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s say the capitalist will work 40 hours
per week.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He’s a retired doctor who is
no longer practicing medicine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He needs
someone to put in the 80-hour weeks who has detailed operating knowledge of the
business (which the capitalist doesn’t have).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Let’s use Subchapter S because the projections show that there are going
to be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big losses</i> for three years, and
then there will hopefully be a turnaround!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The capitalist finds sweat equity and makes a handshake agreement that
the corporation’s two directors will enter into a three-year signed, written
contract for sweat equity with enough money for him to live on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There will be a similar contract for the
capitalist for less money (because he’ll be working less).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Part of the sweat equity deal is that the guy
gets <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>half the upside</i>, that is, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>half</i> the common stock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s how <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> to
do the deal right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Internal Revenue
Code sections needed here are §§ 1032, 351, 61 (gross income includes income
from all sources and including non-cash assets as well as cash; shares of stock
of a corporation are clearly qualifying non-cash property), and 83 (if you
receive non-cash property and its transferability is restricted, you value it
at its value if it had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no </i>restriction
on it).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this transaction, the
transfer of shares must be restricted for two years under federal and state
securities laws.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The restrictions will
be on the face of the certificates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
will be fully valid if the restrictions are on the face in full caps: that’s
considered a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i> restraint on
alienation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Complying with the
securities laws is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What happens if a lawyer has sweat equity?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a $1 par stock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He buys 1000 shares at $1 each.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a restriction on the face of the
certificate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sweat equity dude buys
1000 shares at $1000 per share.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Old Dominion</i> rule says that you take the
highest price paid and project that value backwards to everyone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So our sweat equity has $999,000 income.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each share is worth $1000.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He paid $1 for it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So we multiply $999 times the number of
shares, 1000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the sweat equity person
is rich, then it’s no problem.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They can
cut a check.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, for the average person
this is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>total disaster</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even for Bill Gates, we wouldn’t be
thrilled.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It will be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>service income</i> to sweat equity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then you look at another Internal Revenue
Code section: § 162.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not quite as
bad for sweat equity as it looks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He gets
a deduction!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bill Gates can use a big
deduction!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since he’s working for the
company full-time, he has this great deduction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But the Internal Revenue Service will contend that the sweat equity is
promotional services for organizing the company, and thus is non-deductible
under §§ 263-66.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sub S rules out any different classes of stock except one
category of common stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it has
some good rules!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The debt/equity
distinction will give us headaches.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
what’s the beauty of Sub S?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
regulations have a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>straight debt
exception</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To be straight debt, it
must call for definite payment of principal and interest at definite
times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In that case, regardless of the
debt/equity ratio, for Sub S purposes, they will leave you alone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The regulations even say that you can use, in
certain cases, contractually subordinated debt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can’t</i> use an income
bond.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s that?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s interest payable only if earned.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s not allowed!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s say the capitalist buys 1000 shares of common stock at
$1 per share in cash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the
capitalist has half the upside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
business requires $1 million to get off the ground.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a $999,000 straight debt note.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what’s wrong?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The straight debt note will have to carry an
interest rate of 10-16% per year to be believable because it’s such a risky
note!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, that does not violate the
usury laws of any state, though there are some statutory limits in <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>.<span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So how do you deal with it?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you go to get a bank loan, they will
require <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contractual subordination</i> of
the capitalist’s $999,000 to the bank.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This will be explained more later.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It really means <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>assignment</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Will that kill you under straight debt?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Probably not, but the lessor will be
hesitant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Suppose the lessor says:
“subordinate that baby to all creditors!”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

debt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the company gets sued by
creditors, they’ll go after the capitalist!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

individual guarantee, he’ll have to switch his note to $990,000 of preferred
stock and give up the Sub S election.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
are “inbetween” ways to do this too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You

<p class=MsoNormal>What about Internal Revenue Code § 1244?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman mentioned §§ 461-466, which were
added by Reagan in the 1980’s to discourage tax shelters.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They say: “Even if you’re Sub S, which has a
flow-through, if you don’t work full-time for the company, you can’t use
flow-through losses as they arrive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
can stack them up and use them when you sell the stock.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Full-time is 40 hours per week.<span

only work on your Sub S a few hours a week, you won’t get your flow-through
like in the old days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here is an anomaly: what’s the tax effect of debt when it
goes bad?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is an odd set of rules
that we’ll look at tomorrow. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>One of the
ironies is that often, for a closely-held company, investing in common or
preferred stock is better than taking a note.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

100,000 shares of stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
considerations go into it?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First off,
look at it from a practical standpoint.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Father is a retired physics professor with a good pension.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He’s well-to-do but not wealthy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Suppose that Daughter is his only child and
he’s not married now.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say he can rake up
over $100,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the problems will
be that Daughter and her co-investors will be more interested in their salaries
than dividends.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s
understandable!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could Father make out
well?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sure!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company could do well.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It could get bought out by a big public
company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does Father want to be a
director or an officer?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No way!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He doesn’t want to be liable!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about the downside?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On this hypo, if he invests and the company
goes under, he’ll get an ordinary business loss under § 1244, whereas if he <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lent</i> the money to the company and they
went under, then § 463-66 would only give him a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>capital</i> loss.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§ 1244 is a
sometimes useful <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>oddity</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It gives a limit for a single person.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lastly, you would tell him that his potential
for liability is quite low if he doesn’t try to run things, and isn’t an
employee, officer, or director.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
called “disregard of the corporate fiction”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As long as he’s not active, he’s probably safe.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But should he do it?<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76297509"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Executive stock options</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the 1970’s, executive stock option plans became very
popular.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are governed by §§ 83, 61,
and 162 of the Internal Revenue Code.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§
83 tells you the results of a non-transferable stock option plan.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you advise a client about options, ask
for a plan!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plan can only be adopted
by the board of directors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one else
is allowed to do it!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And if you’re a public
company, you must follow SEC rules, including the proxy rules at § 14 and under
§ 16 (about which more later).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§ 162 of
the Internal Revenue Code contains a major subsection on executive stock
options for public companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first
thing to look for under the plan is the vesting period: the “use them or lose
them” provision.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The point of options is
to tie employees to the company in some sense: a kind of consideration.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are exceptions, though: options can
vest even if someone is no longer an employee if the person dies or is
seriously injured and can no longer work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a federal statute from three years
ago, says that public companies can’t lend money to insiders.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the employee is independently wealthy, he can
exercise his $1 million option.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But for
the average person, this will be a problem.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But the bigger problem comes from the tax standpoint.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Other than § 83, the grant of a
non-transferable stock option to an executive usually creates no income at that
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if the employee wants to
exercise the option, he’s going to get taxable income, in this case to the tune
of $6,000,000!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is, 100,000 times
$70 minus $10.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the good news is that
subject to certain limits in § 162 (which gives a deduction for only <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i> salaries), the company gets a
deduction in the same amount and in the same time that the individual realizes
that income!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This can make it so that a
company doesn’t have to pay any income taxes!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since it’s a public company, the employee can use Rule 144
under the Securities Act to sell within the volume limits of that Rule.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it’s a big company, this Rule will pose
pretty much no problem.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if it’s a small
company with just a few hundred shareholders, it will be a big issue!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The way out is to go to a big securities firm
and coordinate with the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inside</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>outside</i> legal counsel of the company and
with the CEO.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Remember the Bernie Ebbers
story!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He fired one of his top
executives for not telling him when he was going to exercise his options!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The brokerage house will lend the employee some money to
exercise the option, sell enough of the stock to pay back the loan plus taxes
(state, city, federal, Medicare, Medicaid and all that), and give him the
rest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He will have to get the company to
sign off on this because the option plan will have a provision about tax
withholding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company must withhold
taxes on the gross income (federal, state, city, and the employee’s Medicare
tax).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company, the brokerage house,
and the employee will enter into a contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The brokerage house will get its fee, then remit the withholding that
the company must then send to the tax authorities.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The fee will be very high!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What if this is a private company and there’s no public
market for the stock?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once in a while,
the company will have enough money to buy the employee’s option out for what
it’s worth, after withholding taxes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
employee pays taxes and the company gets the deductions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So options work well for public companies,
but for private companies that will stay private they are a bad idea.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the employee is rich enough to exercise
the option, they will, but that’s rare.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But there’s yet another case!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Private companies often want to go public.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say a private company goes public after six
years and they sell several billion dollars’ worth of stock in an IPO.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the IPO, the underwriter will restrict
the sale of the stock for nine months.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The employee will have to clear the sale with the boss, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With options and convertibles, you need to be concerned
about dilution of the common stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
there are $5 billion in outstanding convertible debentures and you can convert
10 shares for each 100 debentures, and your stock is selling for $60, the stock
will get really diluted when the debenture holders convert!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lastly, in terms of accounting, companies may, if they wish,
may value the option upon its issue and treat it as an expense when issued for
accounting purposes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is done by
lots of the country’s big companies!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
the future, all companies may be required to value their options when they are
granted and take an expense deduction on their income statement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The FASB (faz-bee, or the Financial
Accounting Standards Board) is a not-for-profit organization that sets GAAPs
(generally accepted accounting principles).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>FASB must be consistent with what the SEC says.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the SEC generally defers to the FASB when
setting GAAPs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Occasionally, the SEC
will step in, and “once in a blue moon” Congress will step in and alter the
rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this case and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wilderman</i>,
we see that if you’re a Sub C corporation, the Internal Revenue Service is
always bugging you on the issue of reasonableness of salaries.<span

the Internal Revenue Service found that what the husband was getting was
unreasonable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, they disallowed many

the same rule applies <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in theory</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In practice, however, it doesn’t so apply
because public companies hire <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>compensation

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, the federal income tax statutes
regulate, and if you meet those technical requirements, you’re
capitalized.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most public companies have
a majority of their directors as outside, independent directors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Internal Revenue Service, as a practical
matter, usually doesn’t challenge the independence of directors of public
companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For private companies, there
is constant friction of § 162(a), and that’s a big reason they go with Sub S or
a limited liability company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re

business went well for some time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
husband was a good worker and a fine businessman.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The salary scale was set at the company by
the fact that the husband was doing most of the work.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He made himself the President and CEO, and
made his wife the “inside person”, doing the books and records.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As long as the marriage goes well, it’s not a

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What facts were on the husband’s side?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a corporate rule that officers are
elected for a term: one year and “for so much longer as is needed until a
replacement or successor is elected”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Therefore, they both remained directors and he remained the CEO.<span

bank signature cards said that either person could write checks on behalf of
the corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman thinks that the
wife wrote her own check to herself at the old, low scale, and then the husband
declared as CEO that he was worth a lot more than when the board of directors
had last passed on it!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He started
paying himself a lot more!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, there

holds that if there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>true close

bypassing Rule 23.1, which is good for plaintiffs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So here are the holdings of the present case: (1) Only the
board of directors can set the salary for officers and top executive
employees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) If there is a deadlock,

163 of the Internal Revenue Code.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§ 163
sets forth this test: (1) There are a lot of technical rules in § 163 that must
be mastered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First: you can’t make a
public issue of debt securities payable to the bearer.<span

here, you can’t screw around with the tax authorities.<span

make it payable to the bearer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
must be a name on there so the Internal Revenue Service can trace just who got
the interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this doesn’t apply to
private issuances of debt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) Most
public issuances of debt have to be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>registered</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s sort of like the previous rule: there
must be a bond registry maintained by the company.<span

must be definitely amounts of principal and interest required to be paid at
specified times, even if there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no
income!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></i>The debt must <i

closely held, Sub C corporations, as in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Slappey

the interest deduction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In practice, if a public company meets the first two
qualifications, the court won’t go to the de facto equity test.<span

LLC, governed by Sub K, and thus it’s flow-through and you don’t get into the
de facto equity or unreasonable salary problems (with an exception to be
mentioned tomorrow).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But one of the big
selling points of a Sub S or LLC is that you avoid the unreasonable salaries

though there was purportedly a preclusion issue from the <st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>
court decision, <st1:place>Douglas</st1:place> held that the bankruptcy courts
recognize claim and issue preclusion, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>but</i>
because bankruptcy proceedings are unique and policy-oriented, then the
bankruptcy courts can deviate from normal preclusion jurisprudence if there’s a

</span>Say you have a mid-sized public company that needs to raise more
money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They have already borrowed a lot

insurance company, and the insurance company says that they may issue new debts

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The mid-sized public company will issue debentures
(unsecured debt) to the public, with the following clause: “This debt is

their own behalf for their own debt and to file, as our agent, a claim for this
subordinated debt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the total of those
claims yields Insurance Company less than the face amount of the debt to
Insurance Company plus interest, then Insurance Company keeps everything.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>Contractual subordination is, in effect, an assignment
coupled with an agency coupled with an interest declared to be
irrevocable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why that wording?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The typical agency power is revocable even if
the revocation would cause the party revoking to be liable in damages (which is
counter-intuitive but correct).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The big
exception is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>an agency coupled with an

coupled with an interest merely by stating that it’s coupled with an
interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Restatement Second of
Agency says that the agent’s interest in performing services for a principal
doesn’t make it an agency coupled with an interest.<span

if the agent advances substantial money or property, and the parties state
that, then the agency is irrevocable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

subordinated, you’re dead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
subordination goes to all creditors and not just institutional lenders, then I think
you’re dead too.</p>

instruments in civil law countries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both
stock certificates and bonds are typically issued in bearer form.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have a bearer bond from a big company
in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>, for
example, that pays interest twice a year, how do you get the interest?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman has been told that you make sure you
don’t lose the bearer bond!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You take it

give you cash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Voting with bearer stock

to comply with the rules of the NASD and the exchanges if you are a public
company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once you notify the NASD and

<p class=MsoNormal>State statutes literally require the appointment of an
important officer called the Inspector of Elections for each shareholders’
meeting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This person is important
because if there is a close or disputed item, the inspector will conduct an
administrative hearing, take evidence from lawyers for both sides, and then
will issue his certificate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He’ll
basically say, “Jones won” or “Smith won” and give his reasoning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In most states, that report is accepted in
the courts prima facie.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a
presumption that they are correct.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
it’s a close corporation and you don’t anticipate any dispute, they’ll usually
pick one of the corporate officers and name him Inspector of Elections.<span

hire one of the Big Four accounting firms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you have issues that you want to work out up front (before the
meeting) in court, in many states the only way to do so is through declaratory
judgment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you went for a mandatory
injunction, they may say that you’re invading the responsibility of the
Inspector of Elections.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if you ask

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>In re Radom &amp;
Neidorff, Inc.</i> – This case talks about dissolution, which has two
“flavors”: (1) voluntary and (2) involuntary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Voluntary dissolution is governed by § 1701.86-.91, where the
shareholders vote to dissolve the corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That vote will give the directors authority to sell the assets and
.86-.91 will direct the directors (at their own peril!) to pay or make adequate
provision for all creditors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the
directors will distribute the cash left over to the shareholders.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once in a great while, it will be an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in-kind­ </i>dissolution of the
corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there’s only one
shareholder, and they only own Greenacre, then the corporation can distribute
Greenacre to the sole shareholder.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s rare, because under the Internal Revenue Code §§ 331-338, if it’s
a Sub C company, there will be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>double
tax</i>: one at the corporate level and one at the shareholder level.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s why companies often use an LLC.<span

is set up solely for the stock of another company: the whole thing can be
tax-free!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Involuntary dissolution comes in two “sub-flavors” at common

like the <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> statute in the

statute that on its face was broad in the categories of deadlock and
oppression.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were two directors:
the sister and the brother who actually ran things.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was the sister an employee of the
company?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was not.<span

isn’t.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company is solvent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s making plenty of money because the
brother is a good businessman.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
sort of the opposite of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hatt</i>

also a deadlock at the shareholders’ level.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

other!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sister won’t sign his salary
checks! <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>But he had a very simple remedy:
he could have sued under Rule 65 for a temporary injunction.<span

you would add <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i> to

would be enough.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justice Jackson wrote the

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:State><st1:place>Oklahoma</st1:place></st1:State>
statute provided that notice must be given within 60 days after publication in

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Check if the quorum requirement is met!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Look at the statute, regulations, and the charter,
and if there is a special agreement under R.C. 1701.591, you must look at that
too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those agreements are kind of rare,
though.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have four directors and
one resigns, then the quorum remains at <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>three</i>
(a majority of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>full membership</i>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But a quorum need not mean a majority.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe it means that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>everyone</i> must be there!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two big exceptions: (1) Ohio’s statute says: if
there is a vacancy in the board of directors due to death, resignation, total
disability, etc., then “unless the articles are to the contrary, the remaining
directors can fill the vacancy <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>even if</i>
the remaining directors are less than a quorum”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This makes the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

than it was in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) What quorum of shareholders is needed to
elect directors?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s tricky!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
by statute, one-third or more of the outstanding shares must be represented <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in person </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>by proxy</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Proxy means that
you get permission from another shareholder to vote on their behalf at a
certain meeting on a certain date.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
piece of paper is called the proxy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
person who holds it is called the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>proxy
agent</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For a big public company,
they will solicit your proxy, as required by federal law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You sign the proxy card and they will send
you a stamped return envelope, you put it in the envelope and return it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Almost all proxies are revocable, because
it’s an agency that’s seldom coupled with an interest.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The interest of the proxy agent in voting,
standing by itself, is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> enough to
make it an agency coupled with an interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider the situation under the Model Business Corporation
Act.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have a four person board and
one person dies, then three is a quorum.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you have the three living directors show up and you have a 2-1 vote,
you have good action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One yes and two
abstentions under the common law is not good action.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cullen
v. Milligan</i> held that if you’re present and abstain from a vote on
dividends, it counts as a yes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What are the exceptions again?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s say Smith is the President and CEO of Smith,
Inc., which is a corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Smith owns
100% of the stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company runs a
mid-sized grocery store.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The problem is
that the corporation is having financial difficulties.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. Smith talks to Mr. Jones and asks Jones
to sign a two-year contract with the corporation as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>general manager</i> (not an officer).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Part of the deal is that Mr. Jones will lend the company $200,000.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. Jones’s lawyer says Jones will do this
only if Smith gives Jones an irrevocable proxy to vote his stock during the two
year period.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Smith agrees and writes out
a document as an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>irrevocable proxy</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The last paragraph says: “This is a proxy
coupled with an interest, and it is irrevocable for the two year period.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>According to the Restatement Second, that
will be a valid, irrevocable proxy for the two years because it’s coupled with
an interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>New York and Delaware, by statute, go even further, saying
that if Jones doesn’t lend any money but simply agrees to be general manager
for two years under a two-year signed contract, that if a proxy is given and it
is stated to be irrevocable, then it will (by golly!) be irrevocable because
the statute says so!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
doesn’t have a comparable provision.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
you would go under the common law or R.C. 1701.591.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, when
it comes to election of directors, the statute itself imposes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no quorum requirement whatsoever</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, in theory, if a company had 1 million
outstanding shares and Mr. Jones, owner of one share, was the only guy who
showed up to a duly called meeting to elect directors, then unless the charter
or regulations provide otherwise, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mr.
Jones is a valid quorum</i>!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This seems
like a shock, but this is true of presidential elections too!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If only 10% of the people voted, the election
would be just as valid as if 40% of people voted!</p>

and <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> statutes say that if you
have a valid telephonic hookup on which all directors can speak to each other,
then the vote taken telephonically will be binding.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statutes also provide a handy tool:
action can be taken without a meeting <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i>
you have all directors or shareholders sign a document whereby they assent to a
certain action!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The signatures need not

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
there’s a statute that sets out the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>consent
procedure</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Smith owns 51% of

cautions: if it’s a public company, then under § 14(c) of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, you have to send of notice to all shareholders.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once the action is taken, the statutes
generally require that minority shareholders be advised.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We only have this procedure in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
in a couple of specialized sections.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cullen v. Milligan</i>
is an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> case involving R.C.
1701.95, which says that for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purposes of
liability </i>on dividends, a director who is present and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>does not vote no</i> will be deemed to have voted <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>yes</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only way to avoid
liability under R.C. 1701.95 is to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vote</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The question in the case was whether the
statute applies to issues <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other than</i>
dividends, and the answer was no, it doesn’t.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State> and most
United States jurisdictions, directors are far more “under the gun” than in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The common law rule, codified by statutes in
most states, says that in order to avoid liability as a director on an issue,
if you’re present you must (1) affirmatively vote <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>no</i> and then (2) turn to the corporate secretary and say “Please
enter in the corporate minutes my formal dissent from the board action!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re absent from a meeting, you must get
the minutes as fast as possible, and if you disagree with what the board did,
you must register your dissent by registered mail to the corporate secretary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the big deal?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The majority rule is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very
counterintuitive</i> to laymen and a lot of lawyers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re a director of a <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation and they’re doing something foolish, you need to vote no and also
make sure it’s reflected in the minutes that you dissent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
rule isn’t so demanding, because if you turn to the secretary and say “I vote
no”, then you don’t have to take the second step of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>formally</i> entering a dissent to the board of directors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The majority rule is not only
counterintuitive, but it also builds up bad relations on the board.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s annoying enough to vote no!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But when you turn to the secretary and
dictate your dissent, it really ticks people off!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there is a time not only to vote no, but
to make sure you enter your dissent into the minutes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The way corporate cultures operate, once directors
get the agenda for a meeting and they decide they’ll vote no, they tell the
other directors in advance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
often enough to kill the action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As to shareholder votes, in Delaware, the general rule is
that, unless the articles provide otherwise, when shareholders act on matters <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other than</i> election of directors, for
the shareholder vote to be valid, over 50% of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all outstanding shares</i> must be voted affirmatively.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
the rule is stricter: if the articles and regulations are silent, then for a
lot of actions (like merger) the requirement goes up to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>two-thirds</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you are a
public company, you will hire a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>proxy-soliciting

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You see how abstentions can screw things up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have an even number of directors, cumulative voting
will generally prevent a deadlock in the election of directors.<span

articles to go to straight voting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
required vote will usually be (1) two-thirds plus (2) if the vote against is
enough to elect one director, then the amendment doesn’t pass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Say you have four directors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>All of them are elected annually.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The majority of the directors want to go to straight voting.<span

amendment could go through and there would be no appraisal rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here are a few more procedural points on the Ohio system: it
will be straight voting unless one or more shareholders states before the
meeting that it will be cumulative voting and the secretary gives notice to
everyone that it’s going to be cumulative voting.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If someone thinks it’s straight voting and shows up and it’s really
cumulative voting, that person will get screwed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cumulative voting works only if everyone
knows the rules in advance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s
fairly common in all states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s prove the deal with odd and even numbers of
directors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s say we have an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation whose charter says nothing about cumulative voting, meaning that
there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> cumulative voting, because
the statute says so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are 200
shares outstanding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Smith owns 100 and
Jones owns 100.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are four directors,
and they are all elected annually, that is, it’s not a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>classified</i> board of directors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How will the two sides likely vote?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From game theory, we assume that each side
uses <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>minimax</i> theory, meaning that
each side is highly rational and will vote to minimize harm to themselves while
maximizing the upside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a
rational model, which isn’t to say that it always reflects the real world.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So how will the two sides likely vote?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Take the number of shares times the number of
directors to be elected.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, each side
has 400 votes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute says that you
can accumulate and spread among one or more of the four as you wish to maximize
your situation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The ballot will likely
come back with 200 votes for each of Jones-1, Jones-2, Smith-1, and Smith-2.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s assume all the requirements for a valid
vote have been met and that there has been notice given that cumulative voting
will be happening.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Inspector of
Elections issues a certificate of the result.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There were only four candidates, and therefore a new board will take
over!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If any of these people are
different from the old directors, the old people will be pushed out!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here is a different case: say there are only 3 directors,
all elected annually.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One or both sides
demands cumulative voting and the secretary gives notice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is proper call of meeting, proper
notice of time, place and purpose, the charter is silent concerning cumulative
voting, meaning that in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
voting will be cumulative.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
if the charter is silent, we’ll have straight voting.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jones-1, Jones-2, Smith-1, and Smith-2 will
all get 150 votes!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But then there’s a
deadlock!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one is elected!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are no three directors with a plurality
over the fourth!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The result is that the
Inspector of Elections will enter an order than no directors were elected at
the meeting and that the old board of directors carries over.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don’t forget that in the corporate world,
when it comes to directors and officers, you’re elected to serve for a term
plus so much longer, if needed, until your successors are duly elected and
qualified.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(What does qualified
mean?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When someone gets elected to be a
director or officer, have them send a letter of acceptance.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cumulative voting prevents deadlock in the
election of directors only when there is an even number of directors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we get around this?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In the Jones/Smith hypothetical, there are three Joneses and three
Smiths who want to be active in the company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Each is contributing a lot of cash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Let’s say we’re counsel for the Jones family and a different firm is
counsel for the Smith family, while a third firm altogether is counsel for the
new company, to be formed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do we advise Ms. Jones, who will be the CEO, and who
will have two sons active in the business as directors?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do we avoid the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Gearing</i> problem?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We can set
the board at six, and since that’s an even number, we’ll get three from each
family.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that doesn’t deal with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gearing</i>!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What happens if the two sons get killed in an accident?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other side can call a director’s meeting
and replace the two sons with directors favorable to their side, and you’d be
stuck that way until at least the next annual meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One way to get around this is with a R.C. 1701.591
shareholder agreement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But these aren’t
used much.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The legal fees are pretty
high!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, you have the same problem
that you have with prenuptial agreements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A third of the time, you can’t negotiate the agreement!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And if you can’t negotiate the agreement,
maybe you shouldn’t get married!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also,
if you get too much down on paper, you won’t get a deal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, sometimes when you get lawyers
involved, they’ll want to kill a deal over a very small provision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what if we have two classes of stock, let’s say Class J
and Class S?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law, you can have two classes and you can have the charter provide that the two
classes are exactly the same except that each class will annually elect three
directors, voting separately.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can
provide further that no board of directors’ action will be valid unless at
least one member of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>each</i> class of
directors votes yes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, to go against
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gearing</i> and the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statute, you can provide that if there is a vacancy in the J directors, then
just the Class J shareholders will be called to a meeting in order to vote for
a replacement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can provide that the
board of directors will have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>zero power</i>
to vote for a replacement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also have Class J voting, Class J non-voting, Class
S voting and Class S non-voting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
big kahunas of each family want to give gifts of shares without screwing up
voting powers, then the kahunas can give non-voting stock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can have classes of stock that are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>almost</i> entirely non-voting in many
states.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, in other states, all
shares must have a vote.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes the
statutes and constitutions don’t mean what they say!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe the founders have shares with 100 votes
per share, but the publicly issued stock will have 1 vote per share.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Often, that will satisfy state statutes and
the state constitution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
in a given class, each share in a class must have the same voting rights
according to R.C. 1701.44.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
the rule is different.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Providence &amp; Worcester</i>, a clause
said that if you own 300 shares or less, you have 1 vote per share, but if you
own more than 300 shares, than you only have 1/10<sup>th</sup> of a vote per
share.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was in the original charter
of the old railroad, and it served as an anti-takeover provision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Later, as applied to Cincinnati Millicron,
there was a shareholder vote to have the same thing, and <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
courts allowed them to add this clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, however, a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P &amp; W</i> provision is not allowed.<span

we’ll cover ultra vires and read the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Litwin

what the officers and directors did was contrary to the bank’s charter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiffs’ shareholder derivative action
had two counts: (1) negligence and (2) ultra vires.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiffs claimed that since what the
officers and directors did was ultra vires, they had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>liability without fault</i> (i.e. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strict
liability</i>).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court said that the
plaintiffs had it wrong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They said that
in the corporation area if what an officer or director does is ultra vires,
it’s not strict liability, but rather <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>evidence
of negligence</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why did the plaintiff make the argument that he did?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the trust area, if you’re a trustee or an
executor or administrator of an estate, and you do something ultra vires, the
trust rule generally <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> that of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>absolute liability without fault</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That rule is related to a rule on conflicts
of interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unless a trust instrument provides
otherwise, a trustee who sells stock to the trust which later goes down in
value has absolute liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fault need
not be shown.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the corporate world, if
(1) a conflict of interest is fully and fairly disclosed up front, (2) there’s
no injury to creditors and (3) what the director or officer did was reasonable
then there is a defense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It can be hard
to show those three things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why is there a difference between the corporate arena and
the law of trust?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The law of trust and
executors and administrators is designed to deal with the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

with the same thing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the law of
business associations is more entrepreneurial in that it also takes into

<p class=MsoNormal>Lastly, all states have provisions concerning <i

out-of-state) qualifying to do business in that state, e.g. R.C. Chapter
1703.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why do we have these?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) They’re a big aid to the tax authorities
to know who to tax.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) One of the
requirements of these statutes is to designate a registered agent for service
of process.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s say a <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation has its main offices in <st1:City><st1:place>New York City</st1:place></st1:City>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it’s subject to Chapter 1703, they must
file a consent to service of process.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They will often name a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>corporation
service company</i>, such as CT Corp.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why do people resist this so much?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The consent to service of process statutes
don’t stop with torts in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
but govern torts worldwide!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re a <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation with your main office in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>

but also do business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
you can be sued in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But how do these statutes fare under the
Dormant Commerce Clause?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The U.S.
Supreme Court has held that if there is some kind of business operation, like
an office or store or property or mine in the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
then that breaks the chain of interstate commerce enough for <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
to regulate the business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
corporation simply mails things into <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
then even though <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> courts
would have jurisdiction over that company in a products liability case, the
Dormant Commerce Clause precludes Chapter 1703 from applying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bendix</i> was a case
regarding Chapter 1703 and also a separate <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tolling
</i>statute in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That statute says if a defendant in an action
has been out of the state, then in computing whether the statute of limitations
has run, you “carve out” the period of absence and don’t count that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bendix was an <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation that delivered equipment to an <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
vendee and installed it in the vendee’s plant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Chapter 1703 exempts that from having to qualify to do business in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Four years and two months later, a fraud suit
against Bendix was started in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Remember that delivering and
installing machinery constitutes minimum contacts if there’s a long-arm
statute!)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also remember that the
plaintiff’s complaint must clearly plead why he is within the statute of
limitations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The vendee said that based
on the absence statute, the company could have qualified to do business in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
but they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>didn’t</i> qualify to do
business in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, and thus
they’re absent from <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Justice Kennedy held that the statute was
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>discriminatory </i>against interstate
commerce, and the tolling statute was knocked down.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With the tolling statute knocked down, the
general <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> four-year fraud
statute of limitations booted the vendee out of court!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The question is: why the heck did they wait
that long?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s malpractice
somewhere.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So unless you can find a
compelling state interest to justify the restriction on interstate commerce,
the statute goes down as unconstitutional!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What happens if the corporation is formed?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the corporation is formed and you have a highly
formal document, namely, a 3-way novation agreement, then it will clearly be
valid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A novation is a recognized
“animal” of contract law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But things
usually aren’t that simple!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McArthur</i> case
talks about ratification and adoption, which are agency terms both in tort and
in contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In torts, we learn that
even if there is no authorization up front and even if respondeat superior
doesn’t apply, if the principal <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ratifies</i>
the tort afterwards, then you may sue the actual tortfeasor <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> the principal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, if you’re a bus company
superintendent and a driver comes in saying: “I socked this dude on the bus to
teach him a lesson because he was annoying me”, and then the superintendent
says: “I woulda hit him three times”, then that is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>implied ratification</i>, and the company will be liable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ratification can be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>implied</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does this come up in the context of pre-incorporation
contracts?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>McArthur</i>, we’re in <st1:State><st1:place>Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>
in the 1880’s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First off, the promoter
and employee orally agree on a 14 month employee contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On April 2, the corporation is formed and the
board of directors meets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They have
knowledge of the oral contract of employment made by the promoter in
January.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They approve!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, on July 2, the employee is dismissed without
cause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The employee sues for damages
against the corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not an
action for specific performance!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a
legal action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s wrong here?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
the old days, and the new days in some states, partial performance doesn’t take
a contract outside of the statute of frauds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>At the time, there was no strong partial performance doctrine!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The employee says that this was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ratified</i> by the board of directors, and
therefore the corporation is bound.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
corporation gives two defenses: (1) under British law and many American states,
if the principal was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not in existence </i>when
the agent made the contract, then there can be no ratification because the
ratification relates back to the original event, and there was no corporation
in existence on that date!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Besides, if
you relate it back to that date, you’re in violation of the statute of
frauds!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So this seems like a good
argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what the court held was
that there is a separate of related doctrine of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>adoption</i>, and that the board could not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ratify </i>on April 2, but it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could</i>
“hop over one compartment” and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>adopt</i>,
which doesn’t relate back to January 2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When we put the day at April 2, there are 11 months to go, and there is
no statute of frauds problem.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
doctrine of restitution would apply to any corporation that is formed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about the lawyer who does the work of bringing a
corporation into existence?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the
lawyer have a right to get paid when the corporation is born?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The cases are split.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s say Peter Promoter walks into your
office with his wife, Paula.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They want
to promote a company and it will take a lot of complicated and detailed
work.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can a lawyer represent both of
them?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>dual clients</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under Canons
5, 4, and 9 of the Ohio Code of Professional Responsibility, you must warn them
(1) of the potential conflicts between them, (2) that there is no strict
attorney-client privilege and that what one tells you can be discovered by the
other, and (3) that there would be advantages to each one having their separate
attorney.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If, knowing this, they still
want you to represent them, that’s fine, with a major caveat: on every major
matter, you would have to stop and explain how the major matter is favorable
and unfavorable to each client.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a
same thing when a married couple comes in and wants you to craft both their
wills.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This can get hairy!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s a widely used hypo from CLE symposia: H &amp; W come
in and want you to draft both of their wills.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The ordinary will is fully revocable until the person dies and/or goes
crazy (AKA “lose mental capacity”).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
draft the wills, and married couples will usually leave to each other.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Three months later, W calls, saying that she
wants a new will drafted leaving everything to her lover.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the first question is whether you can do
that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course you can’t!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What else do you have to do?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At a bare minimum, you must phone the husband
and tell him, at minimum, that you can no longer represent him vis-à-vis the
will, that you’re no longer representing the wife, and that he should
immediately go to a new lawyer to make a new will revoking the old one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You also have to tell the wife that you can
no longer represent her at all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Representing joint clients can get sticky!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some say you have to tell H about the
lover.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman supposes they’ll get the
message when you tell them to go get a new lawyer and a new will.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if the husband says, “Why are you
telling me this?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You want to make sure
that nobody gets killed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Later, we’ll
talk about quasi-clients in the corporate area: they’re not quite joint clients,
but you incur the same duties.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are
also third-party non-clients who are in privity of contract with you, for
example: if you represent a corporation selling Greenacre to a third-party, and
that party wants your opinion that the contract is cool, and you address the
opinion to that party, that is a third-party non-client who is in privity with
you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can be liable in negligence on
the opinion to him!</p>

only for the corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can she assure
that the land is available if she forms the corporation?<span

husband and parents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’ll represent

the corporation <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>isn’t</i> formed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The thing to do is to pay the guy to have an
option running a few weeks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The option
states that it may be assigned to a corporation to be formed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the formation of the corporation goes
ahead, she assigns the option to the corporation for the cost of the
option.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the corporation doesn’t get

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Frontier Refining
Company v. Kunkel’s, Inc.</i> – This case arises in a state that had the old
Model Act formula, meaning your corporation is either formed or not with no
gray area.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A promoter wanted to start a
gas station.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kunkel needed additional
money and he went to two prospective investors: <st1:City><st1:place>Fairfield</st1:place></st1:City>
and Beach.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He asked them to invest in
the gas station.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case shows why
investors should get a letter from the corporate lawyer stating that the
corporation is validly and duly created under state law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The two guys wrote checks to the promoter,
who promised to form a corporation, but never did.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The promoter goes to the owner of the service
station and enters into contracts under the name: “Kunkel d/b/a Kunkel’s, Inc.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, he never went to the Secretary of
State and he never filed a charter!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The business went belly up!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The seller of the gas station wasn’t paid!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the seller sues the promoter and the two
investors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The testimony at trial was
disputed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are six different
theories the lawyer and client will usually put forward: (1) general
partnership, (2) agency, (3) joint enterprise, (4) statute, (5) third party
beneficiary, and (6) guaranty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The joint enterprise theory, like agency, covers both
profit-making activities and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all other </i>activities
(i.e. not just business activities).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There is some case law in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
suggesting that joint enterprise is alive and well!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The joint enterprise theory is never applied
to the ordinary carpool to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If there is co-ownership of a business for profit, it fits
the general partnership statute, and you can reach all the partners
individually.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another category is the
third-party beneficiary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It may be that
contractual dealings between the capitalist and sweat equity have created a
third-party beneficiary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they have, a
third-party beneficiary can sue in contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The next-to-last theory you look at is guaranty.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Smith, Inc. goes under, but Mr. Smith, the
100% owner, has guaranteed the debts of the company, then you can sue Mr.
Smith.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In some states, the statute of
frauds may be waived.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the present case, if you read the <st1:State><st1:place>Wyoming</st1:place></st1:State>
statute on defective formation carefully, it seems to say that people who act
like a corporation even though they’re not approved to be one will be jointly
and severally liable for the corporation’s debts and liabilities.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here, the two outside investors are a bit
difficult to put in the category of mere inactive investors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not as though someone is going to his uncle
and is getting a $5,000 loan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not
100% clear, but Shipman’s reading is that they disregard the statute and go to
the theory of estoppel because when the entrepreneur failed to make his monthly
payments on what he had borrowed, Frontier sued him in his individual
capacity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They sued Kunkel d/b/a Kunkel,
Inc. and got judgment against him in his individual capacity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The paperwork that he signed with Frontier
was all signed that way, and the court’s holding is based on estoppel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They simply hold that because the fellow was
dealt with as an individual, the Model Act provision that might have made the
investors jointly and severally liable was inapplicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us tie up the loose ends of incorporating.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the rule about the number of
directors?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statutory scheme is common.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The usual
rule is a minimum of three directors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, if you have only one shareholder, you have only one directors,
and if you have only two shareholders then you can get by with only two
directors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, if § 1701.591 is
invoked, you could have a company with 20 shareholders and only one or two
directors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there is no <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>upper limit </i>to the number of directors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is there a minimum number of shareholders?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Up to 1950, there were court decisions that
followed the European practice that since the state statutes required a minimum
of three directors, you had to have a minimum of three shareholders.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Statutes in the 1960’s reversed this, and in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
today, a single shareholder corporation is perfectly legal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The smaller the number of shareholders, the
more likely the corporate veil will get pierced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>But</i>: (1) In many
countries, there must be a minimum of three shareholders.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In those countries, if there is an American
parent that is the only shareholder, then you get two locals to buy one share
each, and they will known as accommodation shareholders.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The parent will have the option to buy back
these shares.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Watch foreign statutes
carefully!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) Even in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and especially in civil law countries, there will be three or four different
classes of corporations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the four
will essentially be a hybrid between a corporation and a partnership.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the hybrid features will be that the
shareholders have joint and several liabilities.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So be careful!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this country, for professional
corporations in some states, they say that doctors may incorporate, but they
will have the same liabilities as a partnership.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
PLC stands for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>public limited company</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the category for public companies
with limited liability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Always end the name of the company with “(comma) Inc.” or
“(comma) Incorporated”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is
recognized <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>throughout</i> the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and most of the rest of the world as
signifying a corporation with limited liability.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Avoid using “<st1:place>Co.</st1:place>”!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At common law, that denominated joint and
several liability on the part of shareholders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A few statutes in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
still say that, but you should make the name “(comma) Inc.” and worldwide
people will know what you’re talking about.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Some state statutes authorize the use of “(comma) Ltd.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don’t fool with it because it’s not exactly
clear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It could also mean “limited
partnership”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have to hold yourself
out as a corporation in every way if you want to be treated like a corporation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The goal is to file the charter, filled out correctly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s called the articles of incorporation in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and the certificate of incorporation in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You fill out the form, take the filing fee,
and have it signed by one or more <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>competent
incorporator</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you pay the fee,
the Secretary of State will timestamp your copy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s important?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
fees are titled by statute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’re in
Title I.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The filing fees are usually not
tiny, but not high either.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Look at the
schedule of fees to determine how many shares you want.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don’t form a corporation with 100 or 500
shares because they’re ultimately going to be spread around a family.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there are too few shares, you may have to
set up a trust to subdivide one share!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Par value: under our statute, you can use par or
no-par.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>never use no-par</i>!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also,
never use high par except for preferred stock!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How come?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many states, like <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
impose both a franchise tax and an income tax, and you pay the higher of the
two.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The franchise tax is a percentage
applied against the assets of the company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If low par stock is used, and generally that will be either $0.01 or
$0.0001 per share, then they will use the par value to determine the tax.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if there is no par, they will use the
fair market value of the stock instead!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Check if the state has a separate stock issuance or stock transfer
tax.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
has neither, but nine states have such a tax.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Sometimes that tax can be avoided by holding the closing of a
transaction in another state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you go back 150 years, people usually set par value at
the initial offering, at what they thought the stock was actually worth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That has ceased to be true in this country,
though in some foreign countries it’s still somewhat true.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today, in this country, par value is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>partially artificial</i>, though
important.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s important because the corporation
must receive at least par value for the issuance of stock <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>or</i> the purchaser will be subject to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>assessment</i> by statute and at common law for the difference.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A sophisticated purchaser of stock will
always ask for the opinion of the legal counsel to the corporation that the
stock is duly and validly issued.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Only
the board of directors can issue stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The lawyer will also have to check that the charter authorizes enough shares
so that there are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unissued</i> shares
available to cover the issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If that is
so, then it is not assessable, it is fully paid.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you use low par stock, like $0.01 or
$0.0001, then you probably won’t have a problem, and thus that’s what most
attorneys will advise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One reason you do
that is to minimize the exposure of directors and lawyers under creditors’
rights proceedings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>High par can be used
to restrict the power of the board of directors, acting alone, without a
charter amendment, to pay dividends and/or buy stock back from selected
shareholders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is assessability all about?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It goes to the heart of a corporation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The usefulness of a corporation is that you
can get inactive investors to buy stock and they have some assurance that if
the company goes bankrupt, their assets in their own possession are not going
to be liable for the deficit at the corporate level.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Early in corporate history, up until 100
years ago, most corporate statutes made shareholders subject to assessment if
the corporation went bankrupt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As late
as 1960, if you filed in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
shareholders <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were </i>subject to
assessment, unless the articles of incorporation provided otherwise.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But in the 1960’s, <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
met the mainstream of American law and said that in general, there is no
assessability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the 1930’s, the
non-assessability general rule was fully adopted in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s in the Ohio Constitution!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s in Art. XIII, § 3.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Are there still corporations around with
assessability features?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yes, there are:
in a few states, policyholders of mutual insurance companies are assessable by
the insurance commissioner if the insurance company goes bankrupt.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what’s the good news?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have 20,000 policyholders, generally,
in those states, if it is an assessable mutual, then it is not joint and
several liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Assessability will be
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>several only</i>, and in many states,
you, as one of 20,000 policyholders, if there is a shortfall in the company,
the insurance commissioner can assess you for only <st1:time Hour="13"
Minute="20">one twenty</st1:time>-thousandth of the deficit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are limited partnerships and LLCs
around that have an assessability clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Stay far away from them!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Within
the past five years, one of the leading management consultant general
partnerships has an assessability clause that paid out very generously.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each partner got assessed $6,000!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a federal estate and gift tax.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some states have a gift tax too.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Mother is setting up a company and putting
$1 million in with 1000 authorized shares at $1 par per share, and she
immediately give 40% of the shares to her children as tenants in common, go see
the tax lawyer because there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gift</i>
there for federal and state purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The state has records that you’ll be interested in from time
to time:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Secretary of State can give
you, for a fee, not only a certified copy of the articles of incorporation, you
can also get a certified copy of the docket sheet for the corporation running
back to formation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Plus, you can get
certified copies of everything that’s there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Secretary of State, also for a fee, will give you a certificate of
good standing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does this indicate?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All state statutes provide that if you don’t
make the required filings annually with the Secretary of State and/or your
state tax returns, then they can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cancel</i>
your corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The certificate of
good standing says that a particular corporation is in good standing with the
state.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re going to make a big
deal, you always send someone to the Secretary of State’s office to get
that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, you will have to get an attorney’s
opinion that the corporation is duly and validly organized and existing as a
corporation under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, the first thing you do is send
someone to the Secretary of State’s office to get all this stuff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In many states, you can get a certificate of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tax </i>good standing from the tax
authorities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the significance of
that?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s limited, but useful,
according to Shipman.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They will certify
that there are no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>assessed</i> taxes
unpaid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How does assessment take
place?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Case law tells us that assessment
occurs in the office of the tax official when that official makes the
assessment by writing or typing in the office!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s basically a claim by the tax commissioner that you owe money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the assessment is sent to you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This certificate will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i> deal with non-assessed tax claims.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is to say, all tax authorities will have
informal or formal audits ongoing, or they will be planning them before the
expiration of the statute of limitations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This certificate of tax good standing does not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>estop</i> them as to that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, it’s still a worthwhile document to obtain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a part of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>due diligence</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In many
states, a failure to file your tax return or pay your taxes on time can mean
the loss of your corporate charter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First off, there is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>de

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>People v. Ford</i> –
This is an Illinois Supreme Court case from around 1921.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The people were represented by the <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
Attorney General or Cook County Prosecutor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The corporate statute in <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
had a requirement that before articles be accepted for filing, they had to be
executed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>under seal</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Secretary of State screwed up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone filed on forms provided by him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They neglected to put the “L.S.” on there!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was a “friendly action” for a
declaration by the Illinois Supreme Court as to whether these were de jure
corporations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re only de facto or
by estoppel, it doesn’t save you as against a suit by the sovereign.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You must be de jure!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Illinois Supreme Court said that the
legislature did say this, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>but</i> the
requirement was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>merely directory</i>,
meaning, legally non-binding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore,
the corporations were de jure corporations despite the screw-up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s this merely directory business?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many state constitutions that didn’t give
their own constitutions a lot of effect, when the state Supreme Court was faced
with a strong directive in the constitution, they would say that the statement
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>merely directory</i>, meaning it’s a
directive by the people to the legislature.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But there was no recourse if the legislature didn’t do what the
constitution said!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re in a state
with constitutional initiatives such as <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
<st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>, and <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
(along with eight other western states), then if you’re putting a provision in
a state constitution this way, you should add a last clause that says: “this
provision is not merely directory to the legislature.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This provision is the law and private
citizens may sue on it and enforce it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So up at the top is de jure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As of 1940, below de jure, the average state would say even if you
aren’t de jure, if you’re a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>de facto
corporation</i> or a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>corporation by
estoppel</i>, then private parties cannot argue that you’re not a valid
corporation even though the state may come in a say that you’re not de jure and
“cut your head off”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So in a case
involving contract creditors contracting with a corporation that hadn’t gotten
its certificate filed, if there’s no fraud by anybody, the contract is made in
the corporate name, there was no individual guarantee from the shareholder then
you have a corporation by estoppel, if not a de facto corporation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It takes a bit more to be a de facto
corporation rather than by estoppel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
you’re de facto, it operates against tort <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
contract creditors, but if you’re by estoppel, it only applies to contract
creditors who made a deal with you in the corporate name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You know a document has been filed when you have a
time-stamped copy with the official seal on it that says it’s been filed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You don’t know before that whether the
document has been filed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Always print
and file a day or two early.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Things can
get screwed up!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Leave yourself time to
recover!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1946, the old MBCA, which Shipman said was a
“hare-brained” statute, said that you’re either a corporation or not, and
there’s no de facto or by estoppel defense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s the situation in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Robertson
v. Levy</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How far was the old MBCA
pushed?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Sherwood</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Timberline</i>,
the courts had to follow what the statute said as to the people active in the
formation and running of the company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There’s no out!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were liable
just as general partners would be!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both
cases, however, used a lot of common sense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As to purely inactive investors, in good faith, the joint and several liability
would not apply.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is generally true
throughout the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They will distinguish between those who are
active in the formation and running of a corporation and the mere investor, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>including</i>, often, the spouse, parent, or
child of the guy who is running the company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shipman says that the courts are exactly right!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The point of limited liability legislation is
to get inactive investors to invest in business enterprises, and in a
capitalist system, there are ups and downs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Maybe inactive investors are willing to risk $10,000 or $20,000, but not
their home and everything else.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s
what makes the system work!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s suppose the defectively organized company itself is
suing and the articles haven’t been filed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

has a common name statute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This statute
says if you’re suing an organization in its common name simply for the recovery
of the assets that the company has, the fact that it’s not incorporated or
defectively incorporated is no defense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>On the other hand, an unincorporated association or defective
incorporated association suing someone else in contract or tort can do so in
the common name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These are widespread
statutes, but there are five or six states that don’t have them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a state that doesn’t have such a statute
and you’re suing a law firm, you need to make copies of the complaint for all
the partners.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
if you sue a law firm for $10,000, you simply lay one copy of the complaint on
the managing partner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Consequently, if
that law firm is suing someone, you’ll need a signature for the firm plus a

<p class=MsoNormal>This means <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>beyond the

in the 1970’s, we were one of the last states to allow that corporations can be
formed “for any lawful purpose” and may say so in the charter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
today, everyone says “any lawful purpose”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>“Any lawful purpose” doesn’t include insurance or banking!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In § 1701.13, we’re given a helpful enumeration of
powers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why did they do that?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the 1920’s, when you had to enumerate your
purpose, the charters would enumerate five or six purposes and then would
enumerate about 20 powers and then they would say: “the purposes are powers and
the powers are purposes!”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were
trying to get back at the legislatures for not allowing the phrase “for any
lawful purposes!”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The federal and state
governments decided early on that in limiting the powers of corporations they
would rely more on antitrust, tax, labor, and environmental laws than they
would on provisions in the charter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s very different from the practice as of 1800!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ultra vires remains important!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What was the law as of 1940, and how did it get up to that
point?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a contract was fully performed
on both sides, there is limited ultra vires relief; almost none.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The exception was corporate directors or
officers engaging in ultra vires acts, which creates a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

head off for an ultra vires action.</p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It cost a total of around $600 billion to taxpayers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The federal banking authorities have federal
legislation saying that as to banks, a provision like R.C. 1701.59(D) can push
the level down to gross negligence, but it can’t push it down to
recklessness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this case, what the
officers and directors did was ultra vires because the charter forbade the loan
and transaction made.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They didn’t run it
by a lawyer!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawyer would have
caught it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a contract is executory on both sides, then any
shareholder of the company can sue the company and the other party and get an

the end, adopts that rule with this caveat: if the contract is <i

other or if an injunction would be inequitable, then there is no relief.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ultra vires and “no authority of agent” are two different
defenses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let us see why.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ultra vires means that the corporation <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>itself</i>, acting through all of its organs
(officers, directors, and shareholders) simply does not have the power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, when you say that the
agent did not have actual or apparent authority, it’s entirely separate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The corporation is saying that the action is
something that the directors and/or shareholders should have approved.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is quite separate, though related to
ultra vires at times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suppose a particular corporate action is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>illegal</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shipman believes that it is a separate defense from the other two,
though it is very closely related.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
you’re trying to enjoin an action as a shareholder, and the directors have
violated a statute, you will usually add <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>illegality</i>
as a count of your suit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The question will
be: does the statute, as interpreted by the court, give <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>standing</i> to a shareholder to raise the illegality issue?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It depends!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This question usually comes up under the rubric of “implied private
right of action”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We use torts
lingo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that illegality includes
criminality but is broader than criminality.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If certain conduct violates a criminal statute, the conduct will be both
criminal and illegal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if it only
violates a civil statute, the conduct will not be criminal but will still be
illegal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that sometimes this is part of contracts lingo, though
under a different name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a contract is
void as against public policy, either party may get a judicial determination
stopping the prospective performance of that contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is similar but different from the
“implied private right of action”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
under the securities statute, R.C. Chapter 1707, there are three or four
express private rights of action,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>R.C.
1707.38-.45.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But in those sections, it
explicitly says that the courts will not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>imply</i>
private rights of action beyond what we the legislature have expressly
stated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, despite that language,
the Ohio Supreme Court has held that if you have a contract to be performed in
the future and that contract is in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>material
</i>violation of R.C. Chapter 1707, either party can come into court and get a
declaratory judgment saying that the contract <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The hypothetical from

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>X, Inc., a closely-held <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation formed in 1921 to do manufacturing, states the purpose in its
charter to manufacture industrial goods.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It has never amended its charter to broaden that purpose.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two items come before the board of
directors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I’m the outside legal counsel
for X, Inc., and the board of directors and officers want my opinion on both
items.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First, one of the officers thinks
that investing $500,000 in the capital stock of a big NYSE natural gas company
would be a good investment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
directors ask me whether this would be ultra vires.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In R.C. 1701.13, a lot of powers are given to
the corporation and they don’t need to be copied into the charter to be
valid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Generally speaking, according to
the statute, ultra vires cannot be raised as a defense by the corporation
itself, but that the provision does not limit quo warranto actions by the
state.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The provision also doesn’t limit
officers’ and directors’ liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Finally, non-complicit minority shareholders of the company can bring
injunctive actions to prevent ultra vires contracts from being performed so
long as the judgment setting aside the contract is not grossly unfair to the
other party to the contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But that’s not all!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Lawyers are always looking to protect themselves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“It’s a jungle out there!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawyers have malpractice liability to worry
about.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We may be asked to render an
opinion that a contract has been duly and validly adopted and is enforceable in
a court by its terms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We may have to
render an opinion to our company and also to a third party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Assuming that the company is solvent and has the money to
invest and assuming that the board and officers have done their research in
investing in the NYSE, one of the express statements of R.C. 1701.13 is that
for companies like X, investing as a pure investor without control in a company
doing something different from what your company does is not subject to an
ultra vires objection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s assume that the company is financially solvent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the officers wants X to purchase 100%
of the capital stock of Z, Inc., a closely held <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation producing natural gas in <st1:place>Northeast Ohio</st1:place>,
where X has its plants.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If X had been
formed in 1980 and the lawyer had put in “any lawful business” as the purpose,
there would be no problem.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We would
simply make sure they had done their due diligence on Z, and that they have the
money to do it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this is a
1921-formed corporation with a specific purpose: to manufacture industrial
goods.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>R.C. 1701.13 says: if you’re
buying control of another company and that company is not within your purposes,
then it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> be ultra vires!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why do we say “can” instead of “will”?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>probably</i>
would be ultra vires, but there’s the possibility that it won’t be, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i> Z’s natural gas wells are very close
to X’s plants and X would plan to use the natural gas produced by Z to run
their manufacturing plants.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then it
would be the same situation as <st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
  normal'>Jacksonville</i></st1:place></st1:City> (see <st1:City><st1:place>Hamilton</st1:place></st1:City>,
notes, p. 277).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But let’s say X is getting their natural gas from a utility
and they’re happy with it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We would tell
X to look at R.C. 1701.69-.72 and propose an amendment to the articles of
incorporation to allow the corporation to run for “any lawful purpose”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That will probably give rise to appraisal
rights to shareholders voting against the amendments.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There will probably be no problem if X is
closely held.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One more point on ultra vires: if all shareholders, voting
and non-voting, approve after full and fair disclosure in advance and if
creditors are not hurt by the ultra vires action, then the ultra vires cause of
action disappears insofar as shareholders are concerned.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are two people who can come after you:
the state can come after you in a quo warranto action.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, if what you’re proposing may violate
agreements with creditors and the creditors don’t assent, then the creditors
can shut down the transaction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As
important as the articles are, the credit instruments of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>any</i> corporation (from Exxon down to Mom ‘n’ Pop, Inc.) are just as
important, if not more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In real life,
you’ll find yourself negotiating with creditors for waivers, you’ll read these
credit instruments to find out what is proscribed and what is allowed, and some
of the credit instruments get very long and detailed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One thing you have to often write an opinion about is
whether stock has been duly and validly issued and non-assessable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another opinion that must sometimes be given

shareholders, will not be personally liable for the debts, liabilities and

the legal opinion is that you simply cannot and should not give that opinion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, it is an uphill battle for people asserting
disregard of the corporate fiction because legislatures have purposefully set
up corporate statutes and other statutes to encourage investment by inactive
investors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The very first thing that an
inactive investor wants is assurance that you can only lose what you put into a
stock and no more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, consider

National Bank Act dealing with insolvency of national banks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before 1933, national banks had to issue $100
par common stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means the shareholders
had to pay at least $100 per share of stock to the company when it was
issued.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The act also provided that if
the bank went insolvent, each shareholder could be assessed up to par.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What was done in 1933 to encourage investment in banks?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They prospectively did away with the
assessment of stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, both the <st1:City><st1:place>Hoover</st1:place></st1:City>
and <st1:place>Roosevelt</st1:place> administrations set up the Reconstruction

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The banks all went to Jones wanting loans
from the RFC.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He checked their balance
sheet and told them that they couldn’t afford to make the interest payments.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead, he caused the RFC to buy <i

banks recovered, the RFC redeemed the stock and over the years managed to break
even.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This case involves a big investor in a national bank who
went to a lawyer before he invested.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
lawyer told him about the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>double
liability provision</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So this investor
formed a personal holding corporation, put money into the corporation, and then
the corporation bought the stock in the national bank.<span

corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During the Depression, that

income, expense, and deductions so as to fairly reflect income.<span

in here and said that the houses were worth $8,000 but were being sold for
$6,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It could have allocated $2,000
as dividends to the member of the cooperative parent saying that the difference
is an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied dividend</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dissent argues that this same line of
reasoning should apply on the disregard of the corporate fiction theory.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a contract case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Remember that if you can prove fraud or a
sham, you can definitely pierce the veil.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

guarantee by the controlling shareholder, but there’s the “next best thing”: an
oral guarantee!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here we have <i

happened here was that one of the unpaid creditors went up to the trucker and
said: “Hey!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You’re way behind on your
payments!”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The trucker said: “If the

defendant says that this is just crap!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s not in writing and it’s not signed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>But</i>, in the last 100 years,
the statute of frauds has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>softened</i> a
good bit, though not totally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
example, if you write out a check with a notation of what property it’s for and
what the purchase price is and you hand it to the other guy, even if he doesn’t
cash it, it’s held to be a signed memorandum.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It describes the land and the price, so it’s found to satisfy the
statute of frauds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, there is the
doctrine of part performance, which can get you out from under the statute of
frauds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When a major or 100% shareholder
of a corporation makes a statement such as: “I will stand by my
corporation!”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court says that he’s
not answering for the debts of another, but rather he’s answering for his own
debts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Post-1980, we have an Ohio Court
of Appeals case stating exactly that.</p>

amendment of articles, sale of all assets, dissolution, statutory merger, and

directors and shareholders typically must approve of such transactions, and
dissenting shareholders typically get appraisal rights so they can cash in
their shares.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This goes beyond so-called
“reorganizations”, which come in two flavors: (1) recapitalization, and (2)
amalgamations, or putting two or more companies together in one of several
ways.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Wall Street firms, you never
get a department labeled “amalgamations”; it’s always called “mergers and
acquisitions”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dissolution of the

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of these corporations are either corporations de jure or
de facto.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, the plaintiff
is not relying on some defect in formation, but instead is going to this
question: assuming there is enough compliance to be de facto or de jure, can
third parties nonetheless look through the corporate veil and hold the active

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Baatz v. Arrow Bar </i>–
This takes place in a <st1:City><st1:place>Fargo</st1:place></st1:City>
bar.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bar owners got a statute passed
saying that in <st1:State><st1:place>South Dakota</st1:place></st1:State>,
there will be no dram shop liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Most states have dram shop liability, meaning that if you serve
excessive liquor to X, and X goes out and negligently kills Z, then Z’s
survivors can bring suit against the bar.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Based on this legislative victory for the bar owners, the Arrow Bar
decided to drop its liability insurance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So their bartender serves too many drinks to X and X runs out and
negligently kills Z, and Z’s survivors bring a wrongful death action.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They sue the bartender.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They try to sue the owners too.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they had been tending the bar themselves,
then they could have been sued as primary actors.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The primary actor doctrine says that even though the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i> may be liable under respondeat
superior, you can also sue the actor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are three exceptions of recent vintage, however: (1) Under the
Federal Tort Claims Act, if a United States government employee is merely
negligent, your only suit is against the federal government itself, and the
federal government cannot recover from the actor because the FTCA didn’t
include statutory provisions to that effect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(2) In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> and many other
state tort claims acts, if a state or local employee is merely negligent, you
can only sue the employer and you can’t join the employee, except if the
employee has acted recklessly or worse, in which case you can sue both the
employer and employee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) Under federal
equal employment law, if an executive sexually harasses someone, you can’t sue
that executive; you can only sue the private employer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This doesn’t seem to make sense!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this doctrine has been rejected through
the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> equal employment
statute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This means that many
plaintiffs’ attorneys send to sue using the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statute rather than the federal statute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So we can sue the corporation under respondeat
superior.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the problem is that the
corporation has a lot of debt to the bank and not much in the way of net assets
once you consider its debts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bank
has a lot of perfected first mortgages on the borrower’s property, because the
bank stays in business by taking mortgages on everything.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why would the bank loan to the company when
it didn’t have much capital?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
shareholders were forced by the bank to sign written guarantees before the bank
lent to the corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a fact
of life!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Until a corporation becomes
fairly prosperous with a lot of assets of its own, banks won’t make loans to it
unless they get a guarantee from the shareholders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Undercapitalization

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is fairly pro-plaintiff in theory.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The black letter rule is that
undercapitalization is a key factor, but as to common torts, if the corporation
has been covered with reasonable amounts of insurance, that will be considered
adequate capitalization.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no
insurance policy here!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They relied on
the state statute!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s wrong with
that?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The South Dakota Supreme Court
declared the statute unconstitutional!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The plaintiff argued that even though the company had some money, the
fact that the shareholders had guaranteed the bank loan was enough to show
undercapitalization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In many states, if you have some kind of immunity and you
nonetheless get insurance, then that will be deemed a waiver of immunity with
one exception: if the insurance policy itself has a clause saying “the writing
of the insurance by the insurance company and the getting of the insurance by
the insured are not considered to be a waiver of any immunity or
privilege”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you work for an insurance
company, you want to put that clause in all your policies because it will
generally be honored.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is also
becoming an issue for not-for-profit organizations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The cost of directors’ and officers’
insurance has gone way up!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The premiums
have probably doubled in the last five years!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Non-profits have convinced their directors (or trustees) that there is
nothing wrong with that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s true that
it’s less of a problem than with a non-profit, but it’s still a problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Good plaintiffs’ medical malpractice lawyers, when suing a

<p class=MsoNormal>In the corporate world, starting after the Civil War,
legislatures modernized the statutes in all four areas.<span

could be a dissolution, charter amendment, amalgamation (statutory merger), or
a sale of all assets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These changes were

 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l5 level1 lfo11;tab-stops:list .5in'>In
     nearly all states, the company need not give consideration to the
     subscriber in order for it to be a valid contract.<span
     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many statutes expressly so provide, and
     when there is no statute on it and there are two or more subscribers subscribing
     on the strength of each other’s subscription, then you know from <i

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Par value</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Historically, if you go back 130 years, par value tended to
represent the value of the stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
people thought the common shares were worth $100 per share, then par value
would be $100.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is no longer true
except with respect to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>preferred stock</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re selling preferred stock for $100,
it will almost invariably be put at $100 par.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Also, in a lot of foreign countries, the old understanding is still in
place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In modern usage, you can use no
par stock, but you should never use it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Also, don’t ever use high par stock except for preferred stock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You should use $0.01 par stock for common
stock, even if you’re selling for $40 per share.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes they’ll even make it $0.0001!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They do that because of franchise taxes,
stock issuance taxes and transfer taxes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What does this have to do with par value?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and many other states, if you use no par stock, the franchise tax is computed
on the fair market value of your assets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But if you use par value, it’s computed on the par value of your stock
and therefore if you’ve used $0.01 par or $0.0001 par, the franchise tax will
be a lot lower.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Neither <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
or <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State> have stock issuance
or transfer taxes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under those statutes,
you’ll end up getting screwed if you use no par or high par value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So why do we still have par value?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Revised Model Business Corporation Act
states, you can choose to do without it!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In fact, very few people take advantage of this.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They use $0.01 par except for preferred stock
because loan agreements, note agreements, and trust indentures, some going back
70-80 years are tied to par value.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also,
occasionally, par value is very useful in that a high par value restricts the
board of directors on dividends because, in a nutshell, under the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
dividend statutes, R.C. 1701.27-.37, the board of directors can declare
dividends only out of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>surplus</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Surplus, generally speaking, is the excess of
consideration for stock over par value (that’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>capital </i>surplus) and accumulated earnings (that’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>earned</i> surplus).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the par is high, the board of directors,
acting alone, is restricted on dividends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider this hypothetical: a corporation is organized by
Promoter, who takes 600 shares, with his friends taking 400 shares.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each share has a par value of $1,000 per
share and each investor pays $1,000 per share in cash.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company thinks it’s going to need
$1,000,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After they set up the
company, they see that they need only $500,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The board of directors consists of Promoter and two subordinates at the
company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can the company return the
extra $500,000 as dividends by themselves?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No, they can’t, because there’s no surplus!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no earned surplus because the
company has just been set up, and there’s no capital surplus because $1,000 par
has been issued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How could they pay a dividend?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’ll have to go to the shareholders under
R.C. 1701.69-.72 for a charter amendment (let’s assume the amendment is to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reduce the par value</i> from $1,000 per
share to $1 per share).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they do that,
under R.C. 1701.27-.37 and .69-.72, there will be created $999,000 in capital
surplus and the dividend can then be paid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Promoter and his friends on the board will have to call a shareholders’
meeting and get 67 votes to go with Promoter’s 600 votes to amend the
charter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On these facts, he could
probably do it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if Paul and his
buddies declared the dividends without doing this, under R.C. 1701.95, they are
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>personally liable </i>to the corporation

interesting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He thinks this will change
with the “opt-in” situation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have
preemptive rights you can have problems!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
preemptive rights are dealt with in R.C. 1701.14-.20.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In older <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
companies, there generally won’t be an opt-out, and the change won’t apply to a
company established before the change.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The common law exceptions are actually built into R.C. 1701.14 along
with some other exceptions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This section
says that if you’re subject to preemptive rights, you can, without a
shareholder’s meeting and without a charter amendment, “bless” the transaction
if you get shareholders owning two-thirds or more of the stock to say that
preemptive rights will not apply to that transaction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that if you do that, you must
immediately notify all shareholders of what you’ve done.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, this provision exists “on top of” the
common law waiver provision.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Preemptive
rights can exist by contract among the shareholders.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are a number of cases where, when you
deal you a close corporation, you find that there is a shareholders’ voting
agreement (per R.C. 1701.591) that has contractual preemptive rights provisions
in it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are situations where the
shareholders want the proportionate ownership kept.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This affects lawyers in a big way!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawyers are often called upon to issue the
opinion that stock is “duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and
non-assessable”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does this opinion
include “no violation of anybody’s preemptive rights”?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s disagreement on this point!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Careful lawyers for purchasers request a
second paragraph that says: “Issuance of the stock does not contravene
anybody’s preemptive rights under the charter, the statute, or any contract or
agreement”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s an example: in the first merger, all the shareholders
voted yes, but the lawyer forgot to amend the articles to take out preemptive
rights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Down the road, under new
management, they didn’t realize that preemptive rights were still there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They sued the lawyer in the first
transaction, and Shipman argues that the lawyer’s opinion was correct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hyman v. Velsicol
Corp.</i> – This is an old case with a lot of lessons for us.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was an <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
corporation, two capitalists, and one sweat equity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a start up, and everyone put in an
equal amount of cash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With start-ups,
you’ll need more money down the road!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You’ll seldom make it on the first infusion of money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company needed more money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The two capitalists owned two-thirds of the
stock and were two of the three directors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The board of directors authorized the corporation to sell a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>huge</i> number of new shares for a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>huge </i>amount of money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company was under preemptive rights.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each shareholder was notified of his right to
subscribe to a third of the offering at the stipulated price.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The two capitalists, who planned the issue,
had the money for their one-third.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
sweat equity didn’t have the money!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So sweat equity sues under the theory of fiduciary
duties.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The two capitalists were technically
complying with preemptive rights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
sweat equity could have afforded it he could have exercised his right to buy
one-third of the new shares.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Preemptive
rights doesn’t displace fiduciary duties!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In a close corporation, the officers, directors, and controlling
shareholders owe <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strong</i> fiduciary
duties to each other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i> codifies that
doctrine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So sweat equity asks for an
injunction stopping the issue because he has no money and after the issue he’ll
only own a few percent of the enterprise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We’re told that the injunction was denied, but we don’t get all the
facts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sweat equity came into court with
unclean hands!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those who seek equity
must do equity!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sweat equity had gone to
work for a competitor and the <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
court held that under the unclean hands doctrine there was no relief on the
fiduciary duty theory.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The capitalists
“kissed the books” correctly on the preemptive rights doctrine!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What other lessons can we draw from this case?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you represent a sweat equity type and the
startup is in corporate form, sweat equity will want a clause saying: “If new
money is needed for capitalist, they will advance it for preferred stock that
is not participating or voting, or else they will advance it as debt.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a high-tech startup, sweat equity wants to
be a major owner when the enterprise goes public.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This will entail <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>heavy bargaining</i>, but keep in mind what sweat equity’s point
is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the startup is in a limited
liability company, the problem is going to be there, but it will be much less
acute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The contractual provisions
protecting sweat equity while dealing with the capitalists can be dealt with a
lot more easily as an LLC with the Internal Revenue Code.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>LLCs are very good for startup ventures in
that Sub K is simply more flexible than Sub C or Sub S.</p>

without a contract</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An agent can get indemnification from the principal if four
conditions are met: (1) The agent is not negligent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) There is no crime.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) The agent acts within the scope of his
employment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(4) The agent violates no
implied or express work rule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 codifies this rule at §
18.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The leading case on the rule is a <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>
trial court case from the 1800s called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>D’Arcy</i>,
in which a <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State> principal
sent his agent down to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Haiti</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and through no fault of the agent, he got thrown in jail and he had to
litigate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The agent finally got out of
jail and back to <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>,
where he sued the principal for indemnification for the litigation
expenses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was held that he made out
the case and would be entitled to indemnification even though he had no
contract for indemnification with the principal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That’s the rule as of 1930.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McCollum</i>, a <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> trial court case from about 1940 shocked the
corporate world!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>McCollum was an
executive of a company that’s now part of ExxonMobil.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the 1930’s, a number of the oil companies
engaged in fixing the price of oil.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There were large downward pressures on oil and many of the company did
“naughty things” in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The government brought a lot of cases and got
a lot of convictions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But when they
brought the criminal case against McCollum, he paid the expenses out of his own
pocket and got an acquittal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then he
asked his employer for indemnification, but the employer refused and he sued
based on the common law principle of agency law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case added a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>fifth</i> requirement to those on the board: McCollum didn’t show any
benefit to the employer, and therefore he couldn’t get indemnified!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some states refused to follow McCollum.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They followed the “classic statement”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After World War II, statutes came about like R.C.
1701.13(E).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
it’s § 144.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Ohio, if you’re sued in
your corporate capacity either by or on behalf of the corporation or by a third
party and you prevail on the merits or otherwise (such as based on statute of
limitations), then you are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>absolutely
entitled </i>to indemnification from the company.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This doesn’t mean you don’t have to have
insurance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Insurance and indemnification
don’t completely overlap.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Your rights
under indemnification are no better than the solvency of the corporation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if you have an insurance policy that
covers you, then the insolvency of the company you work for doesn’t affect your
insurance coverage, assuming, of course, that your insurance company is
solvent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, your R.C.
1701.13(E)(3) right against a corporation might not be worth much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>R.C. 1701.13(E)(5)(b) says that if you’re sued in your

1701.13(E)(1) talks about suits <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>by</i> or
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on behalf of </i>the company, while R.C.
1701.13(E)(2) talks about third party suits including shareholder actions,
creditor actions, actions under the securities laws, and actions under criminal
provisions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both statutes say that other
certain circumstances, the board of directors <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

and (E)(2) do not have any “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must</i>”
language in them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But here’s the new kid
on the block from the 1980’s: R.C. 1701.13(E)(5)(a), which also deals with
attorney’s fees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must</i>” provision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re sued in your corporate capacity and
you make a demand on the company, the company<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> must</i> pay your reasonable attorney’s fees monthly subject to one <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big</i> condition: you must sign a written
undertaking to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonably</i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cooperate</i>, and if you are found to have
been reckless in discharging your duties, you will have to reimburse the
corporation for such attorney’s fees advanced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the 1980’s, we also got R.C. 1701.59(D) and
1701.59(F).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(D) provides that in an
action <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>by </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

your corporate capacity, no money damages will be awarded unless you are found
to have been reckless.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(D) applies only
to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directors</i>, and the same is true of
.13(E)(5)(a), except Shipman thinks that the latter applies to a director <i

that .59(D) also does.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>R.C. 1701.59(F)
makes it clear that (D) does not apply to a suit against a director in his
capacity as a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>controlling shareholder</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’ll get back to the duties of controlling
shareholders later.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The infamous <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>

provisions to apply, the shareholders must vote it in, but in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
it’s just the opposite: they apply unless the shareholders vote it out.</p>

that: (1) You can prevail in different ways: either by acquittal or by a second

</span>(2) It is not all-or-nothing, that is, Wolfson should allocate his legal
expenses among the various counts and as to the allocated expenses, to those

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Justice Department, in its sentencing guidelines, wants

<p class=MsoNormal>Director and officer’s liability insurance is
important.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re advising a client,
don’t go on a board without it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Look at
the coverage and exclusion clauses of the insurance policy.<span

§ 102, we’re told that these new clauses can apply only to actions under the

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ohio R.C. 1701.59(D) and .13(E)(5)(a) don’t
make that distinction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The courts have
held that if the action is a duty of loyalty action against a director or
officer, and all that’s shown at trial is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inadvertent</i>
breach of the duty of loyalty, Delaware § 102 will apply.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman thinks that the same rule applies
here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s another big exclusion?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One is Rule 10(b)(5) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>ERISA is also an
exclusion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The biggest headache is a
clause that says: “If the director or officer received some corporate benefit

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This gets us into the way policies have been drafted for the
last 35 years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the old days, the
policies were written as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>occurrence</i>
policies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you bought a policy for the
calendar year 2004 but you didn’t get sued until 2010 under a discovery rule, that
occurrence policy would cover you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
the problem with this type of policy from the insurance companies’ standpoint
is that it has a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>long tail</i>; the
insurance companies can’t figure out how much they’re on the hook for.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So about thirty years ago, the insurance
companies switched to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>claims made</i>
policies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today, your D &amp; O policy
will cover you for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>claims made </i>in
2004 with two additions, one going backward and one going forward: (1) if you
notify the insurer in 2004 of something that may give rise to a claim and the
claim is made later, then the 2004 policy will cover you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) If you’re buying a policy from the
company for the first time in 2004, things that you fully disclose in detail to
them that happened earlier can, for an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>additional
premium</i>, be covered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a professional retires, they purchase <i

be one and one half to three times your usual annual premium.<span

looking backwards is going to have a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very</i>

examiner’s report, they would have seen that a bunch of claims were about to
break loose.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court held that in
order for the “forward looking” out to apply, you must be specific and detailed

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s one more situation where you can get your attorneys’
fees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The outside legal counsel for a corporation
is asked to review a proposed merger in detail.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He does so using reasonable care and he gives a written opinion to the
directors and officers that, in his opinion, neither federal nor state
antitrust statutes are violated by the transaction.<span

sues the corporation and the officers and directors claiming that it <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does</i> violate the antitrust laws.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The outside lawyer in that situation will
recommend to the board that he enter an appearance for both the corporation and
the directors and officers because he advised <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all</i> of them that in his opinion he thought it was legal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He would say that because he advised <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>everyone</i> that way, there is no conflict
of interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What he is trying to fight
is the government strategy, which is to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>divide
and conquer</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is perfectly proper
for the outside counsel to make an appearance for everyone and handle the
litigation since they were proceeding on his authority.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The board of directors will go along with
this and allow it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not literally

<p class=MsoNormal>It is still fairly standard in a tort case if there are two
defendants and one is negligent while another has committed an intentional tort
like fraud, it is fairly widespread that the judgment that the court will enter
in that case is joint and several liability on the part of both defendants to
the plaintiff, but the defendant that is negligent is entitled to
indemnification from the defendant who committed the intentional tort.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about comparative negligence?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Case after case has held that comparative
negligence statutes by themselves do not preclude this result.<span

intentionality.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> cases in the past fifteen years have held that
if even if due care had been used, the intentional actor was smart enough that
he would have committed the tort anyway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Out west and in the south, you’ll find a number of states that have
eliminated joint and several liability by statute.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They call for percentage allocation rather
than joint and several liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shipman has his doubts whether these statutes would apply when one
person is intentional and one is negligent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

excluded reckless and intentional action by the underwriter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can bet that the underwriter wanted an
opinion from the lawyer for the company that the contract was valid, and the
lawyer for the company knew that on common law grounds, it would not be valid
if it covered reckless or intentional misconduct.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The underwriter got sued and had to pay a
judgment because the offering circular to the public was misleading.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>Sarbanes-Oxley caused an accounting oversight board to be
created.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its relationship to the FASB
has yet to be determined.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its
relationship to accounting standards is going to be quite heavy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The money for FASB and the Accounting
Oversight Board comes from fees charged to public companies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The AOB is subject to oversight by the SEC.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CPAs are licensed by individual states.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a standard nationwide exam, so it’s
pretty easy to get admitted in different states as long as you pay the
fees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The CPA owes its first duty to
public investors and creditors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then
they owe a duty to the company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
independent CPA firm is paid to “tattle” on the person that pays it!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s like being required to pay your spouse’s
lover.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is some chance that the insurance company will say
that the coverage doesn’t fly, and the insurance company will probably
win.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So there’s probably no
coverage!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She wants to know what her
exposure is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There will be big legal
fees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First we’ll want to see whether she had no knowledge or
reason to know of the cooked books.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are no criminal worries if this is true.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There could be a trustee in bankruptcy
action, but there probably isn’t recklessness on the part of our client.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her medical license should be dealt with by a
lawyer in the firm who deals with the medical board.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We must show that she had no knowledge.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So hopefully her medical license will not be
affected.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about taxes?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If she received money for being a director,
then her legal fees and what she has to pay in settlement will be tax
deductible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She has a good income as a
physician.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So talk to a tax lawyer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This may all be deductible as she pays
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She might ask whether she should
transfer assets to her husband.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No,
because that would be a fraudulent conveyance and it would also look bad in the
litigation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hopefully, she has a family
trust for the benefit of her husband and children with spendthrift clauses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In practice, you’ll find that the independent investment
advisor and the estate and tax lawyers are always trying to get people to set
up trusts with spendthrift clauses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
it’s hard to get people to do that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There’s a substantial gift tax payable and they don’t want to part with
control of the money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we can show that she is “pure as the driven snow”, then
we’re in good shape because it’s hard to prove scienter against someone who is
trying to do the right thing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
for the purposes of Rule 10b-5.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
addition, the 1995 Federal Act puts a number of procedural inhibitions upon
plaintiffs who want to file.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can get
around them with a good case, like the Citigroup case, where the plaintiff’s
lawyer knew just how to get around it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§
12(a)(2) is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strict privity</i> section,
and she wasn’t in strict privity with any of the victims.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we must double check that she hasn’t
pulled a “Martha” in the last couple of weeks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She says the first news she had was yesterday, but we must make sure she
wasn’t selling any stock before that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about § 11?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
first big deal is that this statute is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>negligence</i>-based.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a plaintiff’s lawyer has a shot at good money
under § 11, they’ll go under § 11.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
.38 to .43 of the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> statute is
very close.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s also
negligence-based.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§ 11 <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does not apply</i> if there is no <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>registered public offering</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In that sense, it’s different from R.C. §
1701.38 to .41 which apply to public and non-public, registered and
non-registered transactions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>semblance</i> of a privity requirement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You must prove that the shares you bought <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>came out of </i>the registered public
offering.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You don’t have to be the first
purchaser.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could be the second,
third, fourth or fifth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That requirement
doesn’t help us in the question because all the shares in the public market
came out of the registered public offering.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You should always check the statute of limitations; in many cases people
wait too long to sue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this case, we
can expect that the suits will be filed within the next few days or weeks, so
there will be no statute of limitations defense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the defendant can prove no legal cause or
causation-in-fact or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>partial</i> no
causation-in-fact, then that is a defense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are two <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Franklin</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>County</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
cases in the 1990’s on this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Early in
the 1990’s the Federal Reserve Board kept interest rates fairly low, which
encourages homebuilding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Interest rates
have been fairly low for the last four years and we’ve had a homebuilding
boom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two separate local homebuilding
companies went public during that period.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Unfortunately, about nine months after they went public, the Fed greatly
increased interest rates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Homebuilding
temporarily went to hell.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were §
11 suits against the companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
defendants made out either a partial or total § 11(e) defense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were bogus accounts receivable and the nature of those
accounts was not disclosed in the prospectus, obviously.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company has virtually no defense under §
11 except the statute of limitations and § 11(e).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No plaintiff will collect much of anything
from the companies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s divide the prospectus into the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>narratives</i> and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>certified
financials</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As to the narratives,
where the directors are not relying on experts, the director must prove for a
defense: (1) she made a reasonable investigation, and (2) after such reasonable
investigation she reasonably believed the prospectus narrative material to be
true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As to the expert material, the test
is different.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no requirement of
reasonable investigation as to the certified financials.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The test is simple: did the director
reasonably believe the certified financials to be true?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the real world, a lot of material crosses
over between the two categories.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s
not absolutely clear whether she made a reasonable investigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about another possible defense for our client?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Legislation from the 1990’s provides under §
11 that there is no joint and several liability; it is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>several </i>only.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means
that if we can slot her into that, and the jury finds that of the 100% of fault
involved she contributed only 3%, then we would simply multiply the liability
by the percent and that would be her liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It would still be a lot of money, but note that if she doesn’t qualify
for this, it’s joint and several liability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Securities Act of 1933 was based in part upon the
English Companies Act and in part on state “Blue Sky” law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In the English Companies Act, a director <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>can</i> rely in good faith on officers and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>others</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is the law in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
at § 1701.59.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s also the law in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
at § 141-144.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a good faith reliance
rule.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As long as you’re not reckless or
worse and your heart is pure, you can rely upon what officers tell you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This looks like an accounting matter,
though.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The auditors should have gone
out and “kicked the tires” on some of these post office addresses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is, they should have traced it to the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual</i> office or factory.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawyers who are working on a registration
statement and who are careful always do that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The leading case in the area is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Escott</i>,
and it says that you do have to kick the tires.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As to important written documents, you must get the actual material and
read it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably the plaintiffs’ lawyers are looking for big money
from the accounting firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They will want
to settle with our client early.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
like to settle out with peripheral defendants early for modest amounts because
it’s very expensive to finance a class action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Under R.C. 1701.38, Shipman thinks her liability is about the same.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about the liability of the accounting
firm?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s under § 11 and also under
the Rest.2d of Torts § 552, which is negligence-based and would provide a
similar result to the federal result.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The seminal case in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Heddon View </i>from the 1970’s.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are later cases including two in the
1990’s that were decided the same day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The cases hold that comparative negligence will apply if the client was
negligence and caused a tort that damaged himself, you “chop off” that
30-40%.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those cases are especially
important because Shipman thinks that they apply to lawyers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When a lawyer is sued by a client, you’ll
want to throw in the defense of comparative negligence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is the Restatement § 552 applicable to
lawyers?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The authority for that comes from <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dublin Securities</i>, reported in the
Bankruptcy Reporter in the 1990’s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two or three loose ends from yesterday:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Would our client from yesterday have any indemnification
rights or rights over the independent CPA firm, the investment banking firm or
the good <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> law firm that
represents the company?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A bare
possibility exists against the accounting firm depending on what the GAAS
standards were for alleged debtors with post office express boxes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As to the law firm, Shipman doubts it very
much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Law firms seldom say that they’re undertaking a 100%
investigation or an audit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are
exceptions to that: if there is a sexual harassment claim in a corporation and
four of the seven directors authorized the investigation of the fifth director,
then the law firm will be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extremely</i>
careful and investigate the facts fully.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Generally speaking, however, they expressly state in their opinion that
they are relying on facts <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>supplied by
officers </i>and in the normal course of events, if there is nothing strange
about what the officers tell them, they can do so.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both CPA firms and law firms will sometimes
require <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>officers’ certificates</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They will have the officer read, sign and
date it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re an officer, be
careful!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Sarbanes-Oxley § 404, as to public companies, there has
to be a system of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>firm</i> internal
controls established.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This has led to an
elaborate system of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subaffirmations</i>
that top management requires from division managers, addressed to them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This creates additional expense, to the tune
of $4 million a year for a $1 billion company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For lawyers, in giving opinions they will negotiate in the
initial agreement that in certain matters they may reasonably rely upon
officers’ certificates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a good
way to cut down on legal cost.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a
public offering, the outside law firm’s duties run in two different directions:
(1) to the officer and directors, and (2) to the quasi-client.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the lawyer knows or reasonably should know
that what is being done violates the law, then the quasi-client (buyer of the
security) can sue the lawyer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tomash</i>, which
had to do with indemnification, the director there had asked the lawyer for the
company whether what he was doing was legal, and the lawyer said: “Go ahead,
it’s legal.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawyer was wrong, and
an SEC injunction was issued against him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>His best cause of action was against the corporate lawyer who gave the
advice, and then under respondeat superior against the corporation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about the legal opinion to the underwriters?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>long</i>
opinion on many matters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The outside law
firm would be liable to the underwriter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One opinion, for example, is that the corporation has picked the correct
SEC form to file on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the case of a
mistake, there is clear liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Lawyers <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i> opine that there
has been <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>full compliance</i> with the
federal securities laws because these laws include <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>anti-fraud</i> provisions and there’s no way that the lawyer can be
clear that he’s getting the full story from all the officers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the underwriters do require an
independent opinion concerning the truthfulness of the prospectus.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Based on what we know (without a full audit
or full investigation), nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to
believe that the prospectus is truthful in all material respects.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next sentence will say: “The preceding
sentence does not relate to the financial statements.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the real world, there is a lot of overlap
between the narrative and financial statement portions of the prospectus, and
one of the big issues is whether there was an overlap in the case we talked
about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about the law firm’s liability to the client?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their opinion is limited and there is
probably no possibly of liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
lawyers <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> be held liable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the big law firms in <st1:City><st1:place>Dallas</st1:place></st1:City>,
out of tax shelter advice, settled in the amount of their malpractice policy,
$75 million, based on their recommendation of bogus tax shelters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One more thing about deals, registered and unregistered: as
to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unaudited interim </i>statements
(CPAs only audit annual statements), you can get a “comfort letter” from the
CPA firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The purchaser will require
such a “comfort letter” concerning the unaudited statements.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It reads much like the attorney’s negative
opinion: “We have not conducted an audit or a complete investigation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is supplied to you alone; nobody else
may rely on it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The opinion may not be
assigned or transferred and it applies only to this deal.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawyers in practice refer to this as dealing
with the “sister-in-law problem”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say
you’re asked for a big opinion for a client.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Suppose the guy gets the opinion and the sister-in-law has a similar
problem, and the guy copies the letter for her, but it doesn’t fit her
situation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you don’t have that
clause, it’s possible that the sister-in-law can sue you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They will also state: “We have conducted certain limited
inquiries concerning the unaudited statement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>To the best of our knowledge, in our opinion [to prevent a warranty or
contract], based on what we know, the interim statements contain no material
untrue matter <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> they are consistent
with the bases on which the audited statements were prepared.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Comfort letters are useful for three reasons: (1) The
letters come with a prestigious letterhead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(2) The accountants take this seriously, even though they don’t
audit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) You probably trigger R.2d
Torts § 552 because the auditing firm is on notice of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>special foreseeability</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are instances in which it would be wise to get audited
statements for the six month period if you’re really suspicious.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But it will take a while a cost a lot of
money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It costs almost as much to certify
a six month period as it does to certify a twelve month period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>

to prove <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gross</i> negligence in order to
sue that firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The comfort letter

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, at § 12 we find talk
of registration of securities, too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
big form you use, either with a stock exchange or with NASD is Form 10 under
the ’34 Act.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition, you will have
to file a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>listing application </i>and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>signed listing agreement </i>with the stock
exchange or NASD.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re a new
company, going public, you usually will list on an exchange or on NASDAQ at the
same time that you have your ’33 Act statement approved.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But you don’t have to say the same thing
three different times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once your S-1 is
effective, you just fill out the first couple of pages of the Form 10 and
listing application and then attach your ’33 Act statement to it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then you incorporate by reference.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This information is publicly available in <st1:State><st1:place>Washington</st1:place></st1:State>.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>At § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, fraud is
prohibited in connection with the purchase or sale of any security by any
person.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It covers everything!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not often useful to plaintiffs due to
the restrictions of the ’95 Act and the fact that you always have to plead
scienter with great particularity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, the last two U.S. Supreme Court cases on the subject have
turned out to be very pro-plaintiff.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>American investors bought warrants in a <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>
company that also did business in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They went to exercise the warrants, but they
were refused.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They sued the <st1:place>Hong
 Kong</st1:place> company in federal court in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They proved to the district judge that the <st1:place>Hong
 Kong</st1:place> company had intended to squelch their efforts at exercising
from the beginning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case went to the
Supreme Court: was this a proper use of 10b-5?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Rule requires that only a purchaser or seller of securities can
sue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the options were clearly
securities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court held that
if they had the actual specific intent to screw them over from the beginning,
then that’s fraud!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>§ 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relates to
any tender offer by any person for any security.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you make a tender offer to a little
company and you use the mails or means of interstate commerce, you’re
covered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But § 14(e) does not
specifically require the use of the mails or interstate commerce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re using it affirmatively, it’s
usually present, so plead it and prove it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Supreme Court has held that where the statute doesn’t require an
interstate commerce connection but the plaintiff proves it, you’re okay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Compare §§ 12(a)-(b) and 12(g).<span

required to list their securities on a stock exchange.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§ 12 (g) is mainly mandatory in that if you have
over 500 shareholders and over a certain amount of money in assets, you must
file.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§ 12 (g) also permits voluntary
filing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why would anyone want to do
that, though?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The answer comes from the
Williams Act.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The big deal is §§
13(a)-(b): public periodic reporting with the SEC is required.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once you go public and list on the NYSE,
you’ll be filing reports thereafter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Under §§ 14(a)-(c), you have proxies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Under § 16, you have insider trading reports.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§ 16(b) has to do with recapture of
short-swing profits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§ 16(c) deals with
an officer, director, or 10% shareholder and says that a short sale is a
crime.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A short sale is a sale of stock
you don’t own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You sell short when you
think the stock is going down.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the
1920’s, the CEO of a company sold his stock short and made a mint!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was deemed “un-American”!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, you can’t sell “against the box”,
meaning borrowing it from your own stock certificates in your safe deposit box.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have to actually transfer the certificate
when you sell the stock!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Williams Act, §§ 13(d)-(e) and 14(d)-(e), deals with
control share acquisitions and tender offers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>§§ 14(d) and 13(d) are restricted to § 12 companies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there’s an oddity: § 14(e) and the
regulations thereunder apply to tender offers for any security, whether
registered or not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For a private
company, go to the regulations for § 14(e) and Rule 10b-13.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For a public company, go to § 14(d) and
regulations plus § 14(e) and regulations plus Rule 10b-13.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most regulation of tender offers today is
under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>state</i> law but the federal law
is important, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two other ways you can become subject to §
13.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re a public utility holding
company or an investment company, those statutes incorporate the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 provisions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under §
15(d) and regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, if you file an
effective Securities Act of 1933 statement, you become subject to § 13.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now go to 15c-(2)(11), which says that the
SEC has power by regulations to govern quotations for securities on a stock
exchange or the over-the-counter market.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Rule 15c-(2)(11) is mind-boggling, but it has a simple purpose: before
this Rule, if you were a securities broker-dealer and you wanted to enter into
the NASD quotation system, you could do it for quotations for a company not
subject to § 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Rule reverses this: no broker-dealer will
enter quotations for a company not subject to § 13 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 into a quotation system.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There is one exception, which is if a broker-dealer, on his own, gathers
material substantially similar to what would be in the SEC file for a § 13
company, in which case the broker-dealer can enter quotations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This would be easy for an insurance company
because, for 100 years, state law has required insurance companies to maintain
mountains of public periodic information at the state capitol.<span

to do this.</p>

insolvency, that’s a crime under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the company is solvent in this
case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, consider the effect of Rule

undisclosed, unfavorable information about the company, the COO can’t trade.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>Would a § 13(d) report have to be filed?<span

electronically within two or three days.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This won’t be a problem because most bigger companies have people either
in the corporate secretary’s office or general counsel’s office who are
equipped to make these filings for her, and with advance consultation with
those people she could get them to file the report on her behalf.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If she happened to be out of town on the day
that it’s due, she could give those people a signed, written power of attorney
to file the reports.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re over 5%,
there will be both a § 13(d) report and a separate § 16(a) report.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the theory behind the two
sections?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under § 16(a), the market pays
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tremendous attention </i>to what the
insiders are doing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under § 13(d), it’s
an early warning system of a possible <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>takeover

not you’re an officer, director, or 10% holder, you’ll have to report.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>§ 16(b) says that if the client or people within her

period, then any shareholder can bring a suit and recapture the

“sale and purchase”?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s say that
looking back six months over her beneficial ownership range (that is, your
family, trusts and other close people).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We look backwards first and see if she or anyone in her beneficial
ownership range has made a purchase in the past six months.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it was more than six months, we look
forward.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It makes sense that if she buys
stock for $10 and sells for $70, it’s clear she’ll be hit with $60 per share
recapture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if she sells for $70 and
then purchases for $40, $30 per share will be recaptured.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next up, we go over Rule 144, which <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

very favorable to public companies and their insiders and those buying in
exempt transactions from insiders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our
client is under Rule 144 even if all the stock she bought was option stock or
stock she bought through a broker on the securities market because she is an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>affiliate</i> as defined in Rule 405.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We make a checklist for the company: are they
current in their § 13 filing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If not, we
can’t use the Rule.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next, we compute her
beneficial ownership (including ownership by her husband and kids and live-in
mother/mother-in-law, family trust, partnership and charitable organizations
that she runs).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We look at those
people’s transactions and see if this proposed transaction, coupled with others,
will pass the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>volume limit test</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We explain that it must be a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>brokers’</i> transaction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next, if she has acquired any security in an
exempt transaction from the issuer, there will be a holding period of one year
that will attach.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition, any securities
of that nature that she has will have a legend on them, and she’ll have to go
to the transfer agent and get securities without a legend because legended
delivery is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se</i> bad delivery.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She will have to timely file a Form 144.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If she was over 5%, she would have to do
three different filings!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In practice,
half of the transactions have to be unwound, but people screw it up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You’ll be dealing with a local office of the
brokerage house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the Form 144 hits <i

right and you have to cancel it and do it over.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How do we avoid this?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can
file the form a week or so before the transaction, get the local brokerage
house guy and the <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> compliance
director to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> sign off by fax
before you actually sell.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the real

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The company may have filed a stop transfer order with the
transfer agent because she’s a #2 officer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

</span>The transfer agent will usually accept the written opinion of internal
counsel that it’s okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Get that file in
advance with the transfer agent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
will eliminate the stop transfer order.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The internal counsel will usually request the opinion of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>personal</i> lawyer for the officer or
director and we can give it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lastly, the
brokerage house that she has got her to fill out a questionnaire, with one
question being: “Are you the officer or director of a public company?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many brokerage houses also require the
opinion of the internal counsel for the company and again, on that opinion, the
internal counsel will usually require our opinion as a condition
precedent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is a bit complicated, and
there is a lot of paperwork.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She should pick a specific certificate with a high tax

you cannot specifically identify.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A
court will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pick</i> the stock with the
lowest basis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Probably all of her stock
has a basis lower than $70 per share.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A
lot of it is probably option stock for which she may have paid $20 or $30 per

<p class=MsoNormal>Especially in big Rule 506 transactions, there will be a

venture capitalists come in and advance money under Rule 506 for stock.<span

the company will have a chance of going public down the road.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They will require a covenant to register the
stock that they purchased under certain conditions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Usually, there is not one, but two or three
rounds of venture capital financing before a company can go public.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The contract to register is a valid
contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note this practical
limitation: if you’re a venture capital outfit and you’re investing in a
company and the contract to register is conditioned on the company “turning the
corner” and starting to make money, you still have to find an investment banker
interested in such transactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, if it is agreed that the company will go
public, the underwriters will not let the venture capitalists sell over
one-half.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a matter of
merchandising.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the venture
capitalists want to sell more than that, it looks like a bailout and the
offering won’t take.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The underwriter

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the end of nine months, when Rule 144 will
be fully effective as to people who have held the stock for a year or more and
as to non-executives who want to sell, the market price of the stock will go
down an average of 8%.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a risky
business to take a company public, but it can also make you a lot of
money!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Underwriting fees can approach

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can Smith, an affiliate, sell to GM?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Smith can’t use Rule 144 because, among other
things, Rule 144 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i> applies to a
company that is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i> public.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He can’t use § 4(2) because that is limited
to the actual <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>issuer</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Smith can use § 4(1) plus § 2(11): when you
put them together, the controlling person can, in this situation, sell to GM so
long as it is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-distribution</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first sentence of § 2(11) talks about
distribution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If something is a
non-distribution, then when you put § 2(11) together with § 4(1), you have an
exemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This will be a
non-distribution if Smith meets the test of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ralston
Purina</i>: (1) there is full and fair disclosure up front, (2) the purchaser

owned the majority stock of the New York Giants, and McGraw was his manager in
the 1920’s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>McGraw was also a minority
shareholder in the Giants corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>These two basically ran the team and the business.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were about 7-8 other minority
shareholders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>McQuade, a state court
judge, somehow got to know McGraw and <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>McGraw and <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>
asked McQuade to buy some stock in the corporation to the tune of around
$100,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They invited him to be an
officer of the company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>
didn’t call a corporate lawyer!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>McQuade
negotiated with McGraw and <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>
and entered into a contract with him in their personal capacities.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First off, there was a shareholder voting
agreement for a short term whereby the two sellers agreed to vote their stock
to elect <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City> as a
director.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The agreement was in writing
and was short-term.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was signed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no bad intent, and all courts
upheld this first, limited shareholders’ voting agreement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shareholder voting agreements that are
limited, reasonable, in writing and signed can be valid even if they don’t meet
the standards of R.C. 1701.591 because the courts encourage such
agreements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the second agreement, <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>
and McGraw, as directors, agreed that they would keep McQuade as an officer of
the corporation for a reasonable length of years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The stock changed hands.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>McQuade paid the money and took over as treasurer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He performed well.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One day, <st1:City><st1:place>Stoneham</st1:place></st1:City>
called him in and said: “You’re fired!”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>McQuade sues.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first count is
that he wants an injunction for reinstatement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The second count is that if he can’t get reinstatement, he wants
monetary damages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The trial court did
not grant reinstatement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The trial court
thought that the agreement was valid, but in those days you couldn’t get
affirmative injunctive relief to keep a job because the feeling was that you
always had a damage remedy that was adequate at law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a correct statement of the law as of
1921.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the exceptions have grown.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first exception is found in civil service
statutes: if you have a civil service protection with government and you are
wrongfully removed without cause, you can go into court and get an affirmative
injunctive order for reinstatement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
second exception comes in the 1930’s with federal labor legislation: if you
were fired in violation of the union contract or federal labor laws, you, or
the union on your behalf, could go into court and get affirmative injunctive
relief for a wrongful discharge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
third exception was tenure in educational institutions, which has grown over
the last ninety years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have
tenure and are dismissed, you can go to court and get reinstated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The fourth exception is found in state and
federal equal employment statutes from the 1960’s and 1970’s.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can sue for reinstatement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most plaintiffs will opt for money damages,
though, because you don’t want to go back to a job where they don’t want
you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The fifth exception is that if
you’re wrongfully dismissed from state employment in violation of state union
laws, you and your union can get you reinstated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But people will often choose damages instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lastly, there are two “new kids on the block”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Arbitrators can grant remedies that courts
cannot unless the arbitration agreement states to the contrary.<span

from the Court of Appeals of <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>,
a close corporation formed an agreement with a top executive for employment for
a term.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The agreement was in writing and
signed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After a year or two, the company
thought the employee had a disability such that he couldn’t perform and that
therefore their performance in paying money to him was excused.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He disagreed about being disabled and he
wanted his job back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case goes to
arbitration, where the arbitrator finds that (1) he is not disabled though he
does have some health problems, and (2) an affirmative order is entered that he
must be reinstated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This goes all the
way to the Court of Appeals of <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>,
a majority of which held that arbitrators can issue orders that courts cannot
unless the arbitration agreement states to the contrary.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you don’t want an arbitration agreement to
go that far, the magic language is: “The arbitrator shall strictly stick to the
law.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The cases have gone even further
than this case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gigax</i> case
from the Court of Appeals in <st1:City><st1:place>Dayton</st1:place></st1:City>,
arising from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i>, we learn
that there is an intense fiduciary duty in close corporations that can be
enforced different ways.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Four people
formed a company, contributing equal amounts of money and each one being a
director.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For a long time, everyone got
along fine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were no employment
contracts for a term.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were no R.C.
1701.591 agreements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But one day, three
of the directors ganged up on Gigax and gave him the pink slip.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case had two holdings: (1) applying <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i> to the facts of this
case, there were no grounds for discharge for cause, and (2) though Gigax
wasn’t too smart, he was doing a reasonably good job, and when you have a close
corporation with no financial stringency and no grounds for discharge for
cause, the three can’t call in the fourth one and dismiss him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court entered an order of reinstatement
for Gigax.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then one of the judges said
that there was another branch to the case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The line of cases stemming from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mers
v. Dispatch</i> dealt with improper discharge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Later there was a case with a bunch of physicians who formed a
corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were no employment
contracts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was an agreement up
front that if a majority of the board of directors wanted to terminate one of
the doctors as an employee they could do it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Court of Appeals in <st1:City><st1:place>Dayton</st1:place></st1:City>
held that this was not contrary to the holding of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two opinions from Minnesota in the 1970’s in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pedro v. Pedro</i> dealt with a company that
had been run by Pedros for generations without an employment contract or
.591-type agreement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One day, one of the
Pedros was fired without cause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Minnesota Supreme Court held that because the company had a tradition of jobs
for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> qualified Pedros, he could
collect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Keep in mind that the trial court held that both parts of
the agreement in the present case were valid, but they couldn’t grant
reinstatement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is correct for 1921,
though these exceptions have been created since then.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>McQuade had done a good job, and he was not
fired for cause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The part of the
agreement that purported to bind the two people <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was contrary to corporate norms, and hence
unenforceable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that McQuade got
screwed!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He paid out all this money for
minority stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They kicked him out and
took his money!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court also alluded
to the fact that McQuade was a public official and he violated <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> law by negotiating for a private position while
on the pubic payroll.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The rest of the
cases follow from this one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How far could McQuade have gone with an enforceable contract
under <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> law?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With whom would he have had to
negotiate?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The voting agreement is okay,
but we’re talking about a position with the company.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He would have to negotiate with the other
board members, who hire and fire officers and other top executives.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
statute provided that the board would elect officers once a year.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>McQuade could have gone to the full board and
gotten a position for a certain number of years as a high executive employee
with board approval.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such a contract
will go on to say: “Employee agrees to serve as an officer and/or a director,
if elected, without any further compensation.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In other words, his compensation package would be spelled out for this
particular job.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s as far as he
could have gone in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> in
1921.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what about in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
in 2004?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What else could he have done,
and how, under R.C. 1701.591?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could he
have gotten a five-year contract as treasurer under .591?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What do you have to do to get such an
agreement?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You need the concurrence of
both the directors and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> the
shareholders (including <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-voting </i>shareholders).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have to meet the technical requirements

<p class=MsoNormal>Say McQuade <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>had</i>
entered into a five year contract, the board approved it, and it’s in

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The answer is that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

he be dismissed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>without</i> cause?<span

interest and the contract stated that it was irrevocable, this makes for a

though he didn’t buy it from the corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If he had bought the stock <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>from</i>
the corporation, it would have been an agency coupled with an interest and if
there was an irrevocability clause, it would have been irrevocable.<span

have modified the common law rule as to proxies.<span

</i>coupled with an interest under agency law?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>At common law, it’s not clear, but by statute in both <st1:State><st1:place>New

the answer is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>yes</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, in <st1:State><st1:place>New

contract, it is coupled with an interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Keep in mind that the common law rule is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

company is having financial problems.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Smith buys stock from them and at the same time takes an executive
position.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He cannot be dismissed without
cause because this is an agency coupled with an interest and is thus

a signed writing, (4) nothing in the agreement hurt creditors because it was so

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
the courts will consider this question <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>up
front</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can’t use proxies to
remove directors for cause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Proxies are
used for all kinds of purposes by shareholders!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dissident shareholders wanted to put before all the
shareholders assembled at the meeting a resolution that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

loved president.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court is shifty and
subtle!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They admit that in <st1:State><st1:place>New

officers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, under <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McQude</i>, a shareholder resolution
ordering the board to reinstate the guy would be void.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it were an order, the court would strike
it down.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

resolutions to the board as to corporate business are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

if that resolution were mandatory.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why
is this important?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under SEC Rule

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In many instances, the shareholders cannot put in mandatory
resolutions, but in many of those instances where they can, they can change the
language to: “We respectfully request the board to do such and so” and be able
to put it in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Be cautioned that (1) in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
because shareholders have the power to amend the regulations and articles,

1701.58, dealing with removal of directors without cause, has been extensively
amended in the last five years to say that if the board is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

you can’t remove without cause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was

is one of the few states where the shareholders can amend the articles to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>increase</i> the number of directors and to
fill the vacancies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A contested takeover
bid for a public company in Ohio will typically involve the call of a meeting
to increase the board from 9 to 35 (management has the advantage of cumulative
voting in most Ohio companies and will elect some of the 26 additional
directors).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The amendment to R.C.
1701.58 a few years ago is largely meaningless in the context of a hostile
tender offer in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Cognovit clauses</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These start out in 1960.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They are also known as “confession of judgment” clauses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What are they?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In around 15 states, these clauses were
routine both in consumer and commercial transactions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>,
<st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> and most American
states, they were quickly ruled against public policy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Near the end of a contract, it would say: “I,
the maker, do hereby appoint any licensed attorney in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
to confess judgment in full on this note at any time on my behalf.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This authority is irrevocable and we declare
it is an agency coupled with an interest.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In the old days, trial lawyers would simply go down to the courthouse
and find people who they litigated against with a stack of notes and have the
other guy sign them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other guy would
do the same for you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is an odious
practice, according to Shipman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the 1970’s, the U.S. Supreme Court took up two cases in
the 1970’s under the Fourteenth Amendment related to cognovit clauses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
case that reached the Supreme Court, the cognovit clause was in a commercial contract
between two businessmen each separately represented by independent
lawyers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Evidence was also presented to
the Court that the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> practice
was that one the cognovit judgment had been entered, if the maker had a good
defense, then he could usually move for a new trial and move to set aside the
cognovit judgment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once you get that
judgment, you can get a writ of execution and levy on whatever that guy
has.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court ruled in two
cases that, at least in a commercial transaction between sophisticated people,
the practice <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does not</i> violate the
Fourteenth Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the two
cases came an FTC rule outlawing cognovit clauses in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>consumer paper</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>An <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
statute did two things: (1) it outlawed the clauses as to consumer paper,
similar to the FTC rule, and (2) it set out a full-caps legend that must be
typed verbatim into the note.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These clauses are widely used in commercial transactions in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is this agency law?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s an agency coupled with an interest; note
the drafting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if Mr. Smith goes
crazy after signing the commercial cognovit note?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under standard agency rules, insanity
automatically terminates any power of attorney or any agency.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the courts have held that if you
have a cognovit note stated to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest then
that rule will not apply.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Mr. Smith
gives a cognivit note in a commercial transaction to Huntington Bank and then
goes insane, Huntington Bank can still use it against him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what if Mr. Smith dies?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The standard agency rule is that the death of
a principal terminates agency even if neither agent nor third party knows of
the death.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is an old U.S. Supreme
Court case written by Chief Justice Marshall so holding.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most states follow that, even as to cognovit
notes. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Cognovit notes have two big
problems: (1) the death problem, and (2) the lawyer for the creditor can’t sign
it; you must find someone who is not a lawyer for the debtor <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>or</i> the creditor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s very difficult to get people to sign it
because it’s too much of a grey area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> and
the states where cognovit notes are used, people put <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>too much trust</i> in them as a good security device.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, if you’re a small supplier
asked to supply 100,000 units to a small manufacturer, unsecured, you can use
the cognovit note, but you should keep in mind that institutional creditors
such as banks and insurance companies are ahead of you with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>recorded first mortgages</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The cognovit clause will help you collect a
little bit, but not a lot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other
hand, if you’re a debtor with a lot of power, don’t agree with the cognovit
clause!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The judgment can get on the
record in two hours, but it can take two years to get out of it!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The problem is that it is very difficult for
debtors or lessees to avoid the cognovit clauses in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All creditors’ and lessors’ lawyers have them
on their forms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One more bit about agency: the problems that have talked
about death and insanity revoking powers of attorney have caused problems for a
long time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In World War II, nearly every
state enacted a “Servicemen’s Statute”, providing that if you were a
serviceman, you executed a power of attorney before you went to fight overseas,
you told your spouse to sell Greenacre, your spouse negotiated with Mr. X to
sell Greenacre, and a contract was signed, then if neither the spouse nor Mr. X
knew that the serviceman had been killed before the contract was signed, the
contract would still be binding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
common law, before these statutes, that was not the result; the contract would
not have been binding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On big deals,
then and now, the third party dealing with the serviceman will insist that the
serviceperson transfer to a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>revocable
trust</i> with a bank as trustee, since even today you can avoid a lot of these
problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thirty years ago, a “new kid” arrived on the block.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By statute in all states, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>durable power of attorney</i> say that if
someone in a signed, dated power of attorney writing states that “if I lose my
legal capacity to act for myself, then Ms. X is my agent for all of the
following matters”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The power of
attorney can be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>springing</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So long as the person is in their right mind,
Ms. X has no power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand,
the power of attorney can be by a fully competent person.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They can have their lawyer draft a durable
power of attorney for Ms. X while he’s fully in his right mind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So long as the principal retains his sanity,
the power of attorney can be revoked by him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If he loses his sanity, and thus he himself cannot revoke, how can it be
revoked?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It can be revoked through a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>proceeding for the guardianship of the
person and the property</i> in the probate court brought by the relatives of
the principal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Suppose the daughters
don’t like Ms. X and think that she’s not taking care of him well and
squandering his money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They can go into
the probate court and ask that, for example, the eldest daughter be appointed
guardian of the person and of the property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That appointment will cut off Ms. X’s powers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that the durable power of attorney will
not give Ms. X the power to commit the subject to a nuthouse.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She would have to go through very formal
procedures at the probate court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
court would have to appoint an attorney for the man to determine if he’s a nut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The newer kids on the block are the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>living will</i> (by statute in the last twenty years) and the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>health care power of attorney</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can go to a lawyer and have drafted a
health care power of attorney appointing certain people to have your health
care power of attorney if you are unable to work with the doctors in the
hospital.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But note that so far as the
property is concerned, the “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>old</i> kid
on the block”, the revocable trust is often the best available choice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The old man can revoke that trust at any time
while he’s competent and get control of the property back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, the bank can never be appointed the
guardian of the person; it can only be the guardian of the property.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The proceedings in the probate court are
public, and most families hate to deal with it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Finally, as an attorney involved in such matters, keep in mind that you
should tell the person under a power of attorney to account annually to the
children and spouse and get them to approve.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Note also that the Code of Professional Responsibility gets tricky if a
lawyer acts in these capacities.</p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>two
tests</i> for a stock dividend in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

dividend, the total surplus must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>zero</i>
or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>positive</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are two flavors of surplus: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>earned surplus </i>is a running balance of net
profits minus dividends minus losses and minus certain portions of stock
redemptions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The balance of earned
surplus can be positive, negative, or zero.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The other flavor of surplus is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>capital
surplus</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are four ways to
create a capital surplus (four subaccounts).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Each subaccount will be either zero or positive; never negative.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The four subaccounts are (1) consideration in
excess of par, (2) donated surplus, (3) reduction surplus, which comes about by
reducing the par value of outstanding stock, and (4) contrary to generally
accepted accounting principles, <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
allows <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>revaluation surplus</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have land that cost you $1 million and
it’s now worth $10 million, you can put on the left-hand side of the balance
sheet: “Revaluation of land: $9 million”, and then on the right-hand bottom of
the balance sheet, you add in “revaluation surplus” in the amount of $9
million.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Legal scholars think that <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> allow the same, but
Shipman has never been totally sure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
some states, the surplus test is limited to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>earned
surplus</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In both <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, you put the two
together to see if you meet the test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Most companies keep the GAAP flavors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second test which must also be met in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>insolvency</i> test, which is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cash flow</i> test.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equity
</i>insolvency test, which is: do you have enough liquid assets to pay your
liabilities as they come due in the course of business?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other insolvency test is the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bankruptcy </i>insolvency test: do assets
exceed liabilities?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the Bankruptcy
Code, each test is used in various places.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But you must meet both tests, or else directors are personally liable
for issuing dividends.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Read R.C. 1701.95
carefully and you will find that if the directors rely in good faith upon
outside CPAs, company officers, and lawyers, then they’ll be in good
shape.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what’s wrong with relying on
lawyers?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most lawyers won’t help you
much because they don’t want to get involved!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, if you have good officers who have prepared good written
reports, then that helps.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you can get
an outside firm to check the numbers, that’s also good.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A lawyer will tell you that the defense
exists and how to get it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you follow
a good lawyer’s advice on procedure and do things by the numbers, then you’ll
be ahead in court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a crucial Fifth Circuit bankruptcy case from the

price that the land was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really</i>
worth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The agents were probably not told
of the results.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Really confidential info
is given out on a “need-to-know” basis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>These people bought in their own names and took title in their own
names.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the second, truthful press
release they transferred title to Texas Gulf Sulfur, which in turn reimbursed
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us analyze this in the agency context: they were agents
for an undisclosed principal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is this
per se against public policy or fraudulent?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No, it’s definitely not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
are many big investors, buying under 5% of outstanding shares, who want to keep
their transactions confidential for various legitimate reasons.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you happen to get hints from the press
that all is not well, you can sell without any restriction under 10b-5 and you
don’t have to deal with Rule 144 paperwork.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>On the other hand, they may use the press carefully to find out that
there is positive news and they want to load up on more stock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a big Second Circuit case, a person was an
agent for the world’s biggest user of a certain commodity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if there is a fiduciary duty between the
agent and the third party or the principal and the third party, then you must
come clean up front.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, if the third
party puts the direct question to the agent: “Are you buying only for your own
account and not for resale?” and the agent lies, there is an action in fraud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two “curlicues” on the doctrine.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiff’s lawyer will always look for
this early if the apparent defendant is judgment-proof.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, if the defendant is GM or
Exxon, you’ll always get paid if you win.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What happens if the principal gives the agent the money up front to buy
the commodity with, and the agent squanders it away?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That may be the commission of a fraud upon
the principal because the money was given in trust.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the principal pays up front and the agent
doesn’t pay, there are two rules.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
majority rule is that you can’t reach the principal under the doctrine of agent
for an undisclosed principal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The more
modern rule in Restatement Second of Agency is to the contrary: whether or not
the principal has already paid the agent, the third party can get relief from
the principal even though the principal has to pay twice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You hire people who you can trust completely
and who are financially solvent to do this kind of thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas Gulf Sulfur</i>,
the farmers were all paid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They hired
responsible people who issued their own checks that were valid.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The farmers sued for rescission.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Texas Gulf Sulfur settled the fraud
suits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Canadian provinces later
amended their statutes to require disclosure up front of the drilling
information, that is, it would be considered material to the transaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is a partially disclosed principal?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is where the agent says: “I’m buying for
someone else and I can’t tell you who it is, but I’ll give you my own check and
my check is good.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The rules are fairly
close to those for the completely undisclosed principal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fraud and related theories, we are assuming no fiduciary
relationship at all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have big
problems!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Starting in 1910, American
fraud law began to expand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Prior to
1910, the law of fraud was very narrow when it relied upon total
non-disclosure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was helpful if there
was an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overt material representation</i>
or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>half-truth</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if there was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>total non-disclosure</i> and no fiduciary or other special relationship
between the parties, most American courts would not have allowed a fraud
claim.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Samford Brass</i>, consistent with Restatement Second of Torts, deals
with the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>special fact doctrine</i>, where
the total non-disclosure is about not only a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>material</i> fact, but a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>highly</i>
material fact which we will call a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>special</i>
fact.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that a highly material fact
puts the case in the arena of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sherwood v.
Walker</i>, the barren cow case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This case involves securities.<span

moderately knowledgeable about securities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The company sells him options to buy stock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In those days, that meant the option would
have to be held for two years before you could get an unlegended security, and
then the security would have to be held for two years.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The security was unlegended.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The private placement memo did not mention
the Rule 144 restrictions on disposition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The stock does very well for a time, during which Mr. P goes to the
company and asks to exercise the option.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He would have made a lot of money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But the president of the company says that exercising the option would
violate Rule 144.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By the time the
holding period was satisfied, the stock had plummeted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A diversity suit was brought in federal court
under <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> law including
contract and fraud theories.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is
stipulated that there is no fiduciary or special relationship between the
parties, in which case a non-disclosure of even a simple material fact could
have been fraudulent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the contract count, the court held that the plaintiff
didn’t have a cause of action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the
fraud side, they reversed summary judgment for the defendant and remanded for
trial.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They said that <st1:State><st1:place>New

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court found a <st1:State><st1:place>New

store with a huge showroom of half new and half high-quality refurbished
pianos.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A lady came into the store
thinking a piano was new.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was not
told otherwise, and so she wrote a check and took the piano home.<span

wasn’t new.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She sued in fraud, with the
stipulation that there was no fiduciary relationship.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were no consumer laws at the time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court of Appeals of <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> held that where one party to the contract is
under a false impression as to a special fact and the other party knows that
false impression and doesn’t correct it, then if scienter can be shown, there
is fraud even though there is no fiduciary or other special relationship.<span

same doctrine.</p>

indictment, which means that it couldn’t be raised later!<span

well, at least in the Second Circuit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Take, for example, the case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

made out like bandits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If he was going
to say something good about a company, he would tell his lovers in

where his lovers traded, the compliance officers and computers picked up on the
pattern.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They went to the SEC and the
United States Attorney.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a
joint investigation, and eventually Carpenter confessed.<span

</span>The theory is rather uneven in other circuits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That’s not the end of the story.<span

explicit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The opinion said that mere

cases limit the ruling in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas Gulf
Sulfur</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tipper must have
violated his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>duty of loyalty</i> to the
company, and there must be a benefit to the tipper.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rule 10b-5 is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

can be a benefit: (1) business benefits, (2) reciprocity benefits, or (3)
social/romantic/sexual benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The president of an NYSE company goes to a bar and bring his

</span>Can Mr. X, insofar as 10b-5 is concerned, trade on this
information?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yes!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, if the president of the
company talks about a tender offer that the company is going to make in two
weeks at a big premium, we go to Rule 14e-3 which says that in the limited
context of a tender offer reinstates the broad <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>mere possession</i> test of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas
Gulf Sulfur</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that the second
sentence of Rule 14e-3 is not a fraud section.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is also quite broad in that it applies to any tender offer of any

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Chiarella</i> itself
established that 10b-5 is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraud </i>rule.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was amplified by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>SEC v. Dirks</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The latter
case held that the tipper must have violated his duty of loyalty to the company
and must have received a benefit, broadly defined, from doing so.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A breach of the duty of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a prior exam, the CEO of an NYSE company went with an

individuals.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He overheard, and he went
out and loaded up on the company’s stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>10b-5 does not apply to this situation because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Chiarella</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dirks</i>,
insofar as 10b-5 is concerned, overrule the mere possession test of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas Gulf Sulfur</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is due to the literal language of 10b-5
because it’s a fraud statute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justice
Powell explained that journalists and others perform valuable functions in
society and in the securities markets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If a journalist gets a company official to say more than he should, with
the company official violating only his duty of care to the company and getting
no benefit, and the journalist spreads the word, then society is all the better
for it, so the journalist shouldn’t be punished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider 14e-3 in this situation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The president and his executive assistant
were discussing a bigger NYSE company that was going to pick up the subject
NYSE company in a statutory merger at a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big</i>
premium.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>confidential</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nobody knew it
except the two companies and their agents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Both § 14(e) and 14e-3 are limited to tender offers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the question is whether a statutory merger
or sale of all assets is ever a tender offer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The answer is no, because they are both non-coercive in that the
shareholders and board of directors must vote on it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A tender offer is more hostile and doesn’t
require shareholder or board approval.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So 14e-3 does not apply either.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, what Mr. X did in soliciting shareholders was probably a tender
offer and there was no compliance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If 14e-3 had been adopted when <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Chiarella</i> was decided, then Mr. Chiarella would have run afoul of
14e-3 because the undisclosed information related to a tender offer and under
14e-3 the mere possession test of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas
Gulf Sulfur</i>, in that limited circumstance, is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>reinstated</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is to say
that the plaintiff need not prove fraud, breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty,
or benefit by the tipper.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is 14e-3 a
valid Rule?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two big cases say yes, and
Shipman says they’re right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first is
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>United States v. Chestman</i>, a criminal
case from the 1980’s from the Second Circuit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In this case, a wife of a top executive in <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> was told by her husband that there was going to
be a tender offer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She called her
daughter and shared this, telling the daughter up front, “Don’t tell anyone
else.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Never do that!)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The daughter then shared the information with
her husband.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The daughter did not tell
the husband that it was highly confidential.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The husband shared the information with his stock broker and doesn’t
tell the broker it’s confidential.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
the broker goes out and loads up on the company’s stock for himself and his
customers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There followed a criminal prosecution under 14e-3 and 10b-5
of the stock broker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The husband was
granted immunity to testify against the broker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There was a jury conviction on both counts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case came up before the Second
Circuit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As to 10b-5, the court applies
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dirks</i>-<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Chiarella</i> test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They hold
that the government didn’t prove that the daughter and the daughter’s husband
were fiduciaries to each other, and since the daughter didn’t get the husband
to promise to keep it confidential before she told him, the 10b-5 “chain” was
broken, and thus the broker’s conviction on the 10b-5 count had to be
overturned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But as to the 14e-3 count,
they held that the Rule is valid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
ruled that no fiduciary duty need be found.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The conviction was upheld and the sentence was not reduced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are courts that would hold that there is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i> a fiduciary duty between husband
and wife under a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>status</i> concept so
long as they are living together and they’re not contemplating divorce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What the Court of Appeals held was that they
wouldn’t buy the status argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
admitted that fiduciary duty and confidential handling of information can flow
from one of two sources: (1) status, which is the most common, or (2)
contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, if the wife had
said up front: “Husband, this must be kept in the strictest confidence, and
I’ll only tell you if you promise to keep it secret”, then there is a
contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By contrast, if a cab driver
overhears you talking on a cell phone about anything but a tender offer, the
cabbie can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pig out</i> on that
stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, if you tell
the cab driver that you’re about to make a highly confidential call, ask him if
he will keep it confidential, and he says <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>yes</i>,
then there is a contractual fiduciary duty, and if the cab driver pigs out, he
violates Rule 10b-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A U.S. Supreme Court out of the last five years upheld

trading markets, now heavily relies on computers, though it wasn’t always
so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Justice Ginsburg’s opinion on
10b-5, she noted that the alleged wrongful sale or purchase must be proven to
be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on account of</i> the inside
information.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She held that it was in
this particular case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The language of
this opinion led to the new rules 10-b5(1) and 10-b5(2) where you can send
notice to the SEC that you’re going to sell and if, at the time, there is no
undisclosed, unfavorable information, but such information develops after that,
you can still go ahead and sell under certain circumstances.</p>

quasi-class actions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A quasi-class
action is where twenty individual shareholders bring twenty different suits on
the same transaction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 1998 Act
expanded this, saying that if the class action involving fraud and securities
is in the state courts under state law, then the defendants can <i

defendant-friendly) federal courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
newest kid on the block, about to be born, is a bill before the Senate this
week.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a class action bill recently
passed by the House.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s broader than
securities and says that as to many class actions entirely under state law,
even if only negligence is alleged, the defendants may remove to the federal
courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is very popular in the
House, but not popular with the federal bench.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

</span>The deal was submitted to shareholders, who overwhelmingly approved
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The merger closed, and then this

<p class=MsoNormal>This case hit the corporate world like a bombshell because
this is the way boards did business before this case!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zahn
v. Transamerica</i>, the first big 10b-5 case, insider trading was rife!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Delaware Supreme Court says that the
business judgment rule can be shredded by the plaintiff showing (1) fraud, (2)
ultra vires, (3) bad faith, (4) arbitrary or capricious action, or (5) waste
(recklessness by the directors).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
then they added: (6) gross negligence on the merits, and (7) <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>procedural </i>gross negligence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here, the Delaware Supreme Court said that
there was procedural gross negligence by the board, which gets us into the role
of shareholder approval in a public company in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Delaware, the rule, at least since the 1940’s has been
that if holders of a disinterested majority of shares, after full and fair
disclosure up-front, vote <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> to sue
or to approve or ratify, then upon such approval the business judgment rule is
broadened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
if you have such approval and creditors aren’t hurt, then unless the plaintiff shows
(1) fraud, (2) ultra vires, (3) illegality, and (4) waste, then the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shareholders</i>’ <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>judgment</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rule</i> applies and
the plaintiffs are tossed out of court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, it’s even
broader.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Claman v. Robertson</i> came from the 1940’s in the Ohio Supreme
Court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Ohio Supreme Court held that
even if there were fraud upon the company, if the fraud were openly and fully
discussed in the proxy statement asking for the shareholders not to sue and
shareholders holding a disinterested majority vote <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not to sue</i>, then it will be okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This didn’t work to save the defendants here because the proxy statement
to the shareholders was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>riddled</i> with
material disclosure violations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few final remarks on 10b-5: when a close corporation comes
under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i>, you need not
rely on federal law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He believes that
fraud is not required because the fiduciary duties are so intense.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The absence of fraud is important because in
the last 25 years, the federal courts have required extremely heightened
pleading for fraud.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, the 1995 Act
reinforces the requirement as to fraud class actions concerning
securities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you can plead something
lesser than fraud, do it, because it’s much easier to make out a case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition, if the defendant has insurance,
remember that negligence and gross negligence will be covered by the policy,
while hardcore fraud will not be covered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We’re leading up to a defense both to duty of care and duty
of loyalty actions: the defense of special litigation committees, composed of
truly independent outside directors studying the matter and concluding that it
ought to be stopped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We also look at the
defense on the merits of the shareholder decision not to sue.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That will work under either duty of care or
duty of loyalty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It requires that you
can get disinterested shareholders holding a majority of the stock to vote with
you after full and fair disclosure up-front.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You also must show that creditors are not harmed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>non-unanimous shareholder ratification rule</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is also a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s say three siblings each hold 10% of the stock of a Sub
C company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The father owns the remaining
70%.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The three siblings are the
directors and officers and they set their own pay.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the absence of a defense, if the father
starts an action under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam </i>or
under Rule 23.1, the sibling’s only defense to the reasonableness of their
compensation is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overall reasonableness</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i>
possible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the defendants can show
overall reasonableness, both in disclosure and on the merits, and creditors
aren’t harmed, then they have a defense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Note that this is a defense <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on the
merits</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A little company like this
would not have outside directors who could set up a litigation committee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What would we advice the siblings?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We would advise them to hold a joint
shareholders’ and directors’ meeting and get all four people to vote “yes” for
salaries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As long as there is full and
fair disclosure up-front and no creditors are harmed, this is an <i

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here is another defense lawyer’s trick.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Defense lawyers have tried to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bifurcate </i>or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>trifurcate </i>the trial.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you
can convince the judge to do that up-front, then in the preceding example the
defense can be asserted early.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
defendants win, they are home free because it’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>total</i> defense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This has
recently been used in the 1990’s Supreme Court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Exxon </i>case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case came
out of <st1:State><st1:place>Hawaii</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Exxon had a huge tanker serviced under a
contract with a dry-dock company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
company was negligent in servicing the Exxon ship, and as a result, the ship
developed serious problems upon leaving the dock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The captain forgot to map where he was!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because the captain didn’t know where he was,
the ship ran aground and caused a huge amount of damage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Exxon sued the dry-dock company in negligence and in
contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The attorney for the dry-dock
company convinced the judge to bifurcate, saying: “There is an overriding legal
principle that if <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ordinary </i>negligence
by the defendant is followed by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gross </i>negligence
on the part of the plaintiff, then there is no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>legal</i> cause, and thus the dry-dock company has a 100%
defense.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The judge granted the motion
and found that what the Exxon captain did was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>gross</i> negligence, and under respondeat superior, Exxon is bound by
the captain’s actions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He agreed with
the defendant’s legal principle in negligence and he also said the same
reasoning applied to the warranty count on the express written contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if there is a warranty, the judge said,
if the plaintiff reacts with gross negligence then the company has a 100%
defense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The U.S. Supreme Court held that the trial court judge was
totally correct on the merits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What the
defense lawyers did here is get to the “nub” of the matter quickly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Within each “half” of the case, they can use
12(b)(6) and summary judgment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court
did not have to hear testimony about damages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They simply looked at one part of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the example above, what is done by the three siblings
will not bind the Internal Revenue Service because it’s a Sub C company.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the Internal Revenue Service comes
calling, you will have to persuade them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, the brothers are very much protected.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the requirements is that creditors are
not hurt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if the brothers are paid
out much more than they’re worth?</p>

– In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>, as well as in some
other states, courts have held that the ultimate handling of conflicts of
interest is up to the court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a party
meets those statutes, the court just pushes the burden of proof back to the
plaintiff.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A case to that effect was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Comolli v. Comolli</i> from the California
Court of Appeals.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this case, we have
the flip side.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a close
corporation with two 50% shareholders (different families).<span

on the board.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One family runs the company.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company runs into financial
troubles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The family running the
company, without consulting the other family, lends the company money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company goes insolvent and a state court
receivership is started in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other family objects because the family
running the company could in no way approve the transaction under <st1:State><st1:place>Del.</st1:place></st1:State>
§ 144 since they held only 50% of the stock and there were no independent
outside directors on the board.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
family out of power thus said that the claim for the note is per se bad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Delaware Supreme Court, very consistent to their earlier
case, says that the defense of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overall
reasonableness</i> both in disclosure and on the merits with no harm to
creditors is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i> available to a defendant
in a duty of loyalty action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here, the
chancellor examined the loan carefully and found that the loan was reasonable
overall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no fraud or bad
faith.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court-made exception for
overall reasonableness that preceded the statute is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The parent wanted a cash-out merger, meaning
that the subsidiary would be merger into the parent for cash and the parent
would pay cash only.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This invoked the
proxy rules at the subsidiary level since the subsidiary was an NYSE
company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Securities Act of 1933 was
not applicable to the transaction because cash is not a security either for
federal, <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> or <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Was Rule 13e-3 applicable to the situation?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is the “going private” rule.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It applies only to SEC-reporting
companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was not in effect at the
time, but let us describe the effect it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>would</i>
have had.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The thrust of the rule is that
if you have a public company with public shareholders having equity securities
and through one or more transactions with an affiliate those public
shareholders who <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>did</i> have equity
securities end up with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no</i> equity
securities then <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the rule applies</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that if the rule had been in effect at
the time, it would have applied.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
rule says that, in addition to all other disclosure, the board of directors, in
the proxy statement, must expressly state whether, in their opinion, the
transaction is fair to minority shareholders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The board of directors must give detailed reasons for their
conclusion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Rule goes on to say that
the directors cannot delegate this task to an investment banker, though they
will hire an investment banker to help them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is a high burden because the Rule goes on to state that
projections, forward-looking information, appraisals, and “soft” data must be
consulted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You must go way beyond GAAP!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The parent’s financial department had worked up tables
indicating that the stock of the subsidiary would be worth about $22 or
$23.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They wanted to pay $19 which is
what they paid before.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The parent went
through the books and records of the subsidiary without the consent of the
board of directors of the subsidiary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They did their due diligence without the consent of the board.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The information of the subsidiary belongs to
the subsidiary, not the parent!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
also did not set up an independent negotiating committee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They had three outside directors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court says that they should have
appointed an independent negotiating committee who would acquire independent
counsel, investment bankers and CPAs and that if they had done all that, the
business judgment rule would have saved the parent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no approval by a disinterested
majority of shareholders, because a majority of shareholders <i

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Self-dealing is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>serious</i>
conflict of interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can revert to
the more hospitable business judgment rule if you set up an independent
negotiating committee at the subsidiary, but in this case the parent did not.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no other defense available.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, the parent has the burden of
pleading and proving overall reasonableness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Overall reasonableness includes reasonableness on the merits as well as
reasonableness of disclosure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
parent’s records showed that they believed the stock was worth $22-23.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was never disclosed to anyone at the
subsidiary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The defense was not made
out, and thus the case was remanded to determine damages.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you proceed under duty of loyalty,
causation-in-fact can often go by the wayside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You also do not need to show fraud or bad faith if the plaintiff shows a
serious conflict of interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In that
case, it is up to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>defendant</i> to
make out one of the four or five applicable defenses.<span

defendant is going to be a big loser.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s the fallout?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Rule 13e-3 would be applicable today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The federal disclosure requirements don’t add a lot to the <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
requirements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are two Sixth
Circuit cases, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nationwide v. Howing</i>
from the 1970’s that discuss <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
fiduciary duty law and Rule 13e-3.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
casebook tells us that we’re in the area of “squeeze-outs”, or cash-out
mergers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The casebook gives us a number
of cases.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a number of jurisdictions,
there are some very strict anti-squeeze-out cases.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Shipman suggests that where there is full
and fair disclosure up-front (no fraud), there are instances where a
squeeze-out is fair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider a Washington Supreme Court case from the 1950’s, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Matteson v. Zielbarth</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A small startup corporation was about 63%
owned by one person who worked there full-time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The other guy owned slightly more than one-third, enough to block a
merger.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Business was rough, and the company
was about to go under.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The fellow
running the company did some shopping around and found Z, Inc., which thinks
they have a pretty good business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
minority shareholder will agree to certain terms, Z, Inc. will swoop in and
take over the business, continuing to employ the fellow running the company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is stipulated that the fellow running the company was
honest and that the salary he was receiving was reasonable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The salary being offered by Z is also
stipulated to be reasonable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
minority shareholder decided to be difficult.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The shareholder decided that he wanted a portion of the money the main
guy gets or else he would use his power to block the deal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The guy running the company, with the consent
of Z, Inc., set up a new company, N, Inc., and merged the old company into the
new company with him getting stock and with the minority shareholder being
cashed out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no fraud;
everything was done on the up and up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There was a strong business purpose.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shipman believes that the deal was reasonable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court says that where the person being
frozen out has an appraisal remedy, if he waits until after the merger to sue,
then he has no damage remedy (as long as there is no fraud).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
cases we should know about in this area: first, there’s the case of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McConnell</i> dealing with the Bluejackets
from the Court of Appeals, after 1995.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>McConnell and the Wolff family got together to get an NHL team for <st1:City><st1:place>Columbus</st1:place></st1:City>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They didn’t have an arena yet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They went to the mayor and City Council.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>McConnell, the Wolffs, and Lamar Hunt formed
an LLC and got a ballot initiative for a half-percent sales tax to build an
arena.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The ballot initiative was killed
partly by Bob Fitrakis raising up a storm on talk radio.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They still wanted a team!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They went to the NHL and Nationwide Insurance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The head of Nationwide indicated that they
would consider building the arena and leasing it to the team, which is what
ultimately occurred.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hunt wasn’t
thrilled with this change, and decided to block the transaction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>McConnell and Wolff formed a new limited
partnership and went ahead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hunt sued on
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>corporate opportunity </i>and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>freeze-out</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the LLC agreement, a very important clause
said that any one of the members <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could </i>compete
with the LLC.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is often included in
real estate LLCs because real estate folks often have side ventures.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court of Appeals in <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Franklin</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>County</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> held that because of the
clause in the LLC agreement, the transaction was reasonable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is one of the leading cases in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
on Business Associations law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When is the appraisal remedy a shareholder’s sole
remedy?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Ohio Supreme Court decided
two cases on this issue on the same day in the early 1990’s.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The cases mean different things to different
people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Stepak v. Schey</i> and the other was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>State v. Maraschari</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here is
Shipman’s interpretation: when one minority shareholder sues in advance to
block a deal, the fact that he would have an appraisal remedy at the end does <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>toss him out of court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you sue to enjoin, you may have to post a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big </i>bond.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you sue <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>afterwards</i> and there is no fraud or major disclosure discrepancy,
the cases suggest that in the absence of ultra vires, you can’t get damages,
rather, you must elect the appraisal remedy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Corporate opportunity</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This grew tremendously in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1910, you had to prove an expectancy in
the corporation in order to prove corporate opportunity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That changed in the 1930’s with one of the
most famous cases ever decided: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Guth v.
Loft</i>, out of the Delaware Supreme Court, which involved Pepsi.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The decision was very pro-plaintiff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another case was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Irving
Trust Company v. Duetsch</i>, which was from the Second Circuit in the
1920’s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a struggling
company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The DeForrest patents come on
the market.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The controlling person
doesn’t have enough money to buy them from the holder.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the controlling person thinks that he can
rake up the cash in a couple of months.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He wants to tie up the patents, so he has the company sign a contract to
buy the patents with the closing several months in the future.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If he couldn’t raise the money, he figured it
would be the company on the line and not him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But his goal was to raise the money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He worked hard and succeeded.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
caused the company to assign the contract to him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He closed on the contract and made a lot of
money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The company went bankrupt, and the trustee in bankruptcy is
the universal successor to everything the company had, including causes of
action against affiliates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the
trustee in bankruptcy sues.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a close
case because the law says that a wealthy director, officer, or controlling
person does not have lend money to the company when it wants to take an
opportunity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this case, the court
held that as a prophylactic principal that where the company has obligated
itself by signing a contract, the controlling person cannot use the defense
that the company didn’t have the money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If the controlling person takes over the contract and it’s good, then
the company or the trustee in bankruptcy will sue in constructive trust,
damages, and accounting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Miller</i>
out of the Minnesota Supreme Court from the 1960’s does a good job summarizing
the law of corporate opportunity from the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The early cases aren’t fully
consistent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court’s reaction is to
say that when it comes right down to it, the test is really just whether what
the officer or controlling person did was reasonable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the 1970’s, the ALI stepped into the
fray.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They come up with a Restatement
which says that if the controlling person or officer or directors does not
disclosure what he is going to do at the outset to the other directors,
officers and shareholders, then he has per se violated his fiduciary duty and
the corporation can sue him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Northeast Harbor Golf

stick with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Guth v. Loft</i>.<span

– This is a highly egalitarian decision that came as a big shock to the

was a liquid pool of money in the corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The corporation was managed, under contract, by an investment
company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The investment advisor had two
classes of stock: (1) the voting stock, and (2) non-voting stock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A purchaser appeared for the voting stock,
offering much more than liquidation value for the stock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The officers, directors, and controlling
person making the sale did <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i>
checking of the proposed purchaser, but not enough—they were negligent.<span

in his guys, as you would expect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman</i> itself is
a diversity case in the Second Circuit under <st1:State><st1:place>Indiana</st1:place></st1:State>
law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The facts took place during the
Korean War.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At time, especially during
war, wage and price controls are imposed by the federal government, and the
Korean War was one of those times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When
those controls are imposed, you get <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>startling</i>
results concerning the exemptions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
both World War II and the Korean War, employee fringe benefits such as pension
and profit sharing plans as well as Blue Cross/Blue Shield were exempt from
wage and price controls.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore,
government contractors making those payment were allowed to recoup them as cost
from the federal government.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The federal
government treated those costs as legitimate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Out of these wars sprouted employer-paid Blue Cross/Blue Shield and
pension/profit-sharing plans because during both periods companies needed every
able-bodied worker they could find and they could not raise the wage level to
attract more workers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They couldn’t
raise wages, but they could pay fringe benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The same thing was true with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perlman </i>in the Korean War.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There were huge federal contracts left for big companies like GM.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of these contracts involved using a lot
of steel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was not enough steel to
go around.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The end users could not raise
the price that they paid for steel, but the price of stocks and bonds of
corporations was not subject to the wage and price controls.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, if you were an end user like GM
and you were having trouble getting steel, you would get together with another
end user and try to buy mid-sized steel companies by buying the controlling
bloc of stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The end users who bought
stock from the controlling family did not loot or financially abuse the
company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They paid a fair price by the
steel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We know it was fair because it
was set by central planners (ha ha).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
case was brought originally as a shareholders’ derivative action, which would
indicate that the plaintiff thought the recovery ought to go into the corporate
treasury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the course of the Second Circuit opinion, we see a
strange “mid-course correction”: the opinion starts out by saying that “control
is a corporate asset” and that the controlling person has misused or
misappropriated it for himself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then,
towards the end of the opinion, the court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>oozes</i>
into the remedy: they decide to share the control premium with the minority
shareholders, indicating that this right can be asserted either derivatively,
as a duty owed to the corporation (under FRCP Rule 23.1) or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directly</i>, as a class action (Rule 23) on
the basis of duties owed to the minority shareholders themselves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could
have</i> cited a case that we started the course with, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

either or both ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since this case, the <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
courts have said that if there is no looting and no fraud by the corporate
shareholders, then the controlling bloc of stock is his and it’s prerogative to

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What were the facts?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. X owned about 80% of a prosperous stock
savings and loan in the 1970’s before the air went out of S &amp; L
stocks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. Purchaser approached Mr. X
and said: “Merge your company into mine in a statutory merger, and I will pay
you and the minority shareholders a certain number of dollars per share.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A statutory merger or sale of all assets
tends to spread the control premium out over all shareholders on a per share
basis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. X said: “No way!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can you make me another offer?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. Purchaser says: “I think I see what
you’re driving at.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I’ll buy your 80% at
more bucks per share and then we’ll work together to get the minority
shareholders to sell out at a lower price.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They did so and didn’t inform the minority shareholders what had
happened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. X helped Mr. Purchaser get
the minority shares at a much smaller price per share.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The California Court of Appeals holds that
the control premium must be spread out evenly for two reasons: (1) Mr.
Purchaser had originally wanted to tango in an egalitarian way that would have
paid everyone the same per share.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2)
This was botched by Mr. X, who additionally committed fraud in helping get Mr.
Purchaser the rest of the stock at a cheaper price.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case cites <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i> with great approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next big <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
case was from the California Supreme Court: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ahmanson</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. Ahmanson lived in <st1:City><st1:place>San
  Diego</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometime
during the 1930’s, he started a stock savings and loan.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was a financial genius and the S &amp; L
did very well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He owned about 80% of the
S &amp; L.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was not publicly traded,
and he wanted a public market so that he and his controlling shareholder
buddies transferred their stock to Newco.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That can be done tax-free under Internal Revenue Code § 351.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Newco then owned about 80% of the stock S
&amp; L and Newco made an IPO that made Mr. Ahmanson financially liquid as well
as rich.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before this, he was rich, but
his money was tied up in the company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Meanwhile, Ahmanson tried to pick up the minority stock with very
lowball offers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The minority
shareholders generally had enough sense to reject him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They still owned stock only in the S &amp; L
but not Newco.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the worth of the
S &amp; L was now in the public domain!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A suit was brought and it reached the California Supreme
Court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They discuss <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perlman</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brown v. Halbert</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The cause of action could be asserted either
directly, derivatively, or both.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was it
a breach of the fiduciary duty to form the holding company and not let the
minority shareholders in on equal, per share terms?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was held that this was probably so, but
the case was tried below under an erroneous legal standard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case shall be sent back to the trial
court, which will be told that the controlling shareholder will win if he can
show both of two things: (1) there was a valid, bona fide business purpose for
excluding the minority shareholders, and (2) the purpose could not have been
served by less drastic means.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course,
he couldn’t prove that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He died, and his
estate settled the suit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here is where
it gets interesting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For tax purposes,
the Internal Revenue Service often recognizes two important concepts: (1)
minority discount, and (2) control premium.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Compute the value of 100% of the stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Multiply the result by the percent holdings of the minority
shareholder.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apply to that figure a
discount from 15-40% recognizing the minority status.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
appraisal law, they have said no to a minority discount on a closely-held
minority stock interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
the situation is unclear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are
opinions indicating that where it is a closely-held concern, if you elect
appraisal rights, they may apply that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you buy 8% of a company that is closely-held, then the regulations
will be amended to say that the stock will be redeemed when the buyer dies and
to establish a fair market value “without regard to minority discount”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why do we put this in the regulations?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>
cases that indicate that this may not happen unless you put this language in
the regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Internal Revenue Service was in dispute with the
Ahmanson estate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had the controlling
bloc of Newco.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s say that Newco
stock was selling at $45 per share.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
does that mean?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is the value of an
atomized 100 share bloc having no real factor in control.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s why most tender offers are at well
above the NYSE price.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They say to
Ahmanson’s estate that a control premium will be added because he has such a
big bloc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>According to the newspapers,
the statute of limitations for a refund claim had not run, and they used this
doctrine to get around the control premium!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There’s an interconnection here between tax and finance (and “everything
else”).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nobody knows what the current
situation in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> is.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Somebody buying will not pay a control
premium, with certain exceptions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
fear that they may have to pay twice because of these doctrines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Honigman v. Green
Giant</i> – Why is the Green Giant jolly?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Green Giant is a very old company, and the founding family took Class A
stock that on a share-for-share basis was just the same as Class B, except that
Class A carried 1,000 votes per share as opposed to just one vote per
share.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some call this kind of stock
“founders’ stock”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the company were
liquidated, the Class A stock held by the family would only get about
2-3%.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, they control.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The family talked with investment bankers and
proposed this deal: call a shareholders’ meeting to amend the articles, under
which on a ten year basis we can exchange our Class A shares for Class B shares
and get our equity participation increased from 3% to 9%.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, they would be paid to be
egalitarian.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This proposition was put to
the shareholders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The proxy statement
had full and fair disclosure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was
overwhelming approval by the Class B holders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Mrs. Honigman was a shareholder in <st1:City><st1:place>Detroit</st1:place></st1:City>
who didn’t like this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She went to <st1:City><st1:place>Milwaukee</st1:place></st1:City>
to bring suit in federal court in a diversity case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She argued that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i> gave her an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inalienable
right</i> to stop this transaction.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The court held “pish tosh”, there is no fraud, no damage to
creditors, no waste, no illegality, full and fair disclosure up-front, and an
overwhelming majority voting for it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Therefore, under the <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
standard, with shareholder blessing, Mrs. Honigman hasn’t a leg to stand
on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She argued that control was a
corporate asset and it ought not be subjected to this kind of waiver.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court laughed at her argument.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is one of the most important cases ever
decided in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i>
chain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, we
have one provision that you should pay close attention to: R.C. 1701.59(D)
combined with .59(F).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>.59(D) generally
says: as to duty of care owed by directors to the company, you can’t hold them
liable in money damages unless the plaintiff proves recklessness or
intentionality.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have noted before
that .59(D) doesn’t apply to purely prospective injunction relief.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It also doesn’t apply to hardcore conflict of
interest transactions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But many
companies today will have a majority of independent, outside directors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, R.C. 1701.59(F) says that
.59(D) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does not apply</i> to a
controlling person acting <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as a
controlling person</i>—the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tomash</i>
analysis.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a company is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>a public company and the independent
outside directors approve the transfer of a controlling bloc of stock to
somebody, then the shield of .59(D) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does
not apply </i>to that transaction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That’s a very important section!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If it’s a public company, then that provision of .59(F) doesn’t apply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two other places where <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i> doesn’t apply.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You have an amalgamation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
acquiring company enters into contracts with many of the controlling persons of
the acquired company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does this violate
conflict of interest law?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does it
violate <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman v. Feldmann</i>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The answer is pretty well developed in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law: if the employment contracts are reasonable and are fully and fairly
disclosed up-front, there is no problem with the transaction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is this the correct resolution, according
to Shipman?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In an amalgamation, one of
the first things that the purchasing company wants to button down with either
employment contracts or covenants not to compete is that the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>goodwill</i> will transfer: the controlling
persons won’t turn around and compete with you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The employment contracts or covenants not to compete are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>crucial</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you don’t get them, it can be legal malpractice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, if you look through <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law of the last thirty years, you’ll find that if there is a good reason for
treating the controlling person a little differently from others, it will be
upheld if you can show there is a sound reason for doing it and that it is
reasonable and fully disclosed up-front.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Let’s say Smith owns 19% of X, Inc., which is an NYSE company.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>GM wants to amalgamate X, Inc. into itself in
a statutory merger using its own common stock as the consideration.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>GM wants to button the deal down as early as
possible, and they talk to Smith and the directors of X, Inc., saying: “Under
R.C. Chapter 1704 and under the poison pill, if the board of directors agrees
to this, we can buy Smith’s stock right now and we’ll buy it for our common
stock using Rule 506.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We agree that
within seven months we will cause X, Inc. to be merged into GM for GM common
stock at the same rate that Smith got the stock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you research <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law, you will find that’s okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is
no doubt that it’s okay under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both sides of the transaction will
be tax-free under Internal Revenue Code § 368(A)(1)(a).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Generally, acquiring corporation outside of <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State>, they don’t want to chance it and they will
comply with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perlman</i>, <i

          well-connected. In the 1960�s and 70�s, we had federal equal
          employment statutes passed. The federal statute is Title VII of the
          Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI deals with discrimination in
          educational institutions, thus, OSU is subject to both of those
          Titles. Most states, a little later, all passed their own equal
          employment statutes. </span

          has a strong state statute. In many respects, it�s stronger than the
          federal statutes, thus local plaintiff practitioners use the local
          statutes whenever they can.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What was the issue? A single female associate was passed over for
          partnership. She sued, alleging that it was because of her gender. If
          that proved true, usually that creates a right of action under Title
          VII. King &amp; Spalding hired the foremost civil rights litigator in
          the South. The argument was made by that lawyer that: (1) partners are
          not employees (which is generally true). There�s no withholding of
          their earnings. They usually are not covered by workers' compensation.
          (2) A partnership is an �intimate choice� of business associates and
          thus it would be improper to apply this civil rights law.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The Court came out very predictably: the first proposition is
          correct, but the second proposition is not. If you hire associates,
          holding out some possibility of partnership, it is discrimination
          against employees (associates of a general partnership law firm are
          employees) to discriminate. A 12(b)(6) motion was reversed. Even if
          the plaintiff thought she could win, would she really want to keep
          working there? The case was settled for a pretty big money award. Note
          that the equal employment statutes provide that if you prevail in your
          suit, you can get reasonable attorney�s fees.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How does such a settlement work? You need the lawyer to sign off on
          it. The lawyer is entitled under common law and federal law to the
          fees. The lawyer and client must agree on a settlement. They should
          agree on how the check should be drawn. It will usually be sent to the
          lawyer. The lawyer may say: �Why don�t you endorse it, I�ll endorse
          it, and then we�ll deposit it in the lawyer�s trust fund. Then we�ll
          figure out the division between us.� It gets more complicated when
          other parties have subrogation rights and liens.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Up to quite recently, professionals in all states were prohibited
          from incorporating. The state legislatures and courts thought that
          they should stick with the general partnership or else their personal
          liability would extend to their personal assets as well as the firm�s
          assets. Around 1960, law firms saw that their colleagues in the
          general counsel�s offices of corporations were getting good tax breaks
          on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">fringe benefits</i>: for
          example, pension plans and health insurance. The law firms wanted
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">relief</i> and went in two
          directions: (1) they went to Congress, and Congress passed the
          Jenkins-Keogh Act, also known as Pension Plans for the Self-Employed.
          Jenkins-Keogh is not as liberal as pension plans for corporation
          employees. So this is only partial relief. (2) They went to state
          legislatures, and most state legislatures, if not all, authorized
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">professional corporations</i>,
          a special professional corporation statute. In </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >, it was passed in about 1960 and it is in Title XVII. Shipman thinks
          it�s around O.R.C. � 1775. It�s an odd statute that you apply in
          conjunction with � 1701.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>So what happened here in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Ohio</span></st1:place

        ><span
          >? For doctors and dentists, many of them immediately hopped on the
          professional corporation bandwagon. Many are still there today. CPAs
          could not do to due to the code of ethics of the AICPA (American
          Institute of Certified Public Accountants) prohibited incorporation.
          This business form was available to lawyers too. But there was a big
          �hiccup� along the way! The Ohio Supreme Court ruled that (1) the
          legislature could not legislate concerning the governance of lawyers
          in this way, (2) only a Supreme Court rule could allow it, and (3)
          they <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">would</i> allow it, but
          only if there was a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">charter provision</i>, saying
          that each shareholder of a professional corporation of a legal nature
          had the same liability as a general partner of a general
          partnership.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>So this Supreme Court case is from 2003 from </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Oregon</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. This statute, even as to doctors, has a clause in it that the
          shareholders have the same liability as general partners of a general
          partnership. So what has happened in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place
            ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Ohio</span></st1:place
          ></st1:State
        ><span>
          in the interim? In around 1995, the Ohio Supreme Court issued new
          rules, saying that lawyers can go into an LLC, a � 1701 corporation,
          the old professional corporation,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and</i> that the old provision
          about shareholders having the same liability as general partners of a
          partnership was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">abolished</i>.
          Different states are at different stages on this right now, and it
          works differently for each profession. You must look at each
          profession. The </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          legislation makes it clear that the governing boards for each
          profession still have regulatory oversight, and it works out
          differently for each profession.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In the 2003 Supreme Court case, what was the issue? There was an EEOC
          action by a non-shareholder employee against the corporation under
          Title VII of the federal civil rights statute. Title VII does
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> apply to a firm having
          fewer than 15 �employees�. But just what does �employee� mean?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Compare this to </span

        ><span>
          equal employment statute, the number is four, and a part-time employee
          is explicitly counted as one. Also, the Ohio Supreme Court has held
          that in a veterinary firm with only three employees, the alleged
          mistreated non-shareholder employee, though she couldn�t sue under the
          federal statute, she would have about the same rights under </span

        ><span>

          rights are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">greater</i> under
          state law than <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">federal</i>.

          than federal law! Today, many federal judges are averse to 20<sup

          century liberalism ideals, moreso than state court judges.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the problem with the 15? There were four shareholder officers
          and directors. For state workers' compensation purposes, they were
          treated as employees, and that would also be the case in </span
        ><st1:State

          ></st1:State
        ><span
          >. For unemployment compensation purposes, both federal and state,
          they were treated as common law employees. If you excluded these four
          or five people, there weren�t 15
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">employees</i>, and the company
          moved at summary judgment for exclusion from the statute. That issue,
          in the Second Circuit, had been resolved against the
          shareholder/employees. They held that if you choose the corporate
          form, the fact that you�re a shareholder, and even a majority
          shareholder and a director doesn�t affect the fact that if you
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">work</i> full-time for the
          company, then you are an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">employee</i>. Out west, one of
          the courts held just the opposite: it�s a small, intimate,
          professional corporation. The shareholders who are also officers and
          who work full-time for the company are
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> employees. In </span
        ><st1:State

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The approach taken by Stevens in the majority opinion is somewhat in
          the middle. He says that he will remand the case so that the Court of
          Appeals can apply his opinion. But just what is Stevens�s opinion? He
          says that he might agree with the corporation
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">as to </i>shareholders who work
          for the company and who have such
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">large</i> stock holdings that
          they cannot be fired. It�s a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">cannot be fired test</i>! If a
          single doctor incorporated, and he was the sole director, the
          president, and the sole medical employee, then no one could fire him.
          The Second Circuit, or </span

          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >, in that situation would say that this guy is still an employee. Now
          change the facts: three doctors own a third and each one is on the
          board of directors. Note: any two of them could fire the third. So,
          applying the Stevens test, they can all be fired!</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Other crucial aspects of this opinion: Stevens goes over the status
          of the Restatement Second of Agency under federal law. When agency
          issues com up in the context of federal statutes, the Court has made
          it clear that they will go to Restatement Second of Agency and apply
          it. Why? You get national uniformity. Stevens discusses the 12-14
          items you look at to determine if a person is a servant-agent, and he
          says that will apply. The truly important thing is usually the
          person�s time allocation, place allocation, and minute-by-minute
          conduct subject to legal power by a third person, then there is a
          servant-agent relationship.</span

          memo, there is a related problem: the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">statutory employer</i>
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">doctrine</i> for workers'
          compensation purposes. The case involved a construction contract. This
          involved the subcontract between a subcontractor and a general
          contractor. The general is going to subcontract out three or four
          things nearly always. The subcontract with the subcontractor did not
          mention workers' compensation. The subcontractor had no workers'
          compensation because they didn�t pay the premium! For a roofer, it
          costs about 25 cents on every dollar you pay a roofer. That�s
          dangerous work! But it�s 49 cents per $100 for a secretary. A worker
          was injured on the subcontractor�s job. The subcontractor has no
          workers' compensation, which is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">illegal</i>, but
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">it happens a lot</i>. The Utah
          Supreme Court, not known for its 20<sup>th</sup> century liberal
          leanings, applied standard American law. They held that the general
          contractor, at minimum, should have required, in the contract, that
          the subcontractor to get workers' compensation and pay the premiums.
          When the general didn�t do so, the general became the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">de facto</i> employer of the
          guy who was injured, and thus the guy would get workers' compensation
          through the general contractor.</span

          state can push this off onto workers' compensation based on premiums
          paid by employers, the state thinks that�s great! Federally, if you�re
          paid by workers' compensation, you can�t get Medicare. Why? Over half
          the medical payments in this country come from Medicaid and Medicare.
          It�s a huge burden on both state and federal government! For example,
          so long as Shipman has OSU health coverage, Medicare is

          determinations. Each must be in the scope of employment. As to agency,
          read the Nutshell carefully. Over the last hundred years, scope of
          employment has expanded to protect workers: there can be scope of
          employment even if there is a violation of the work rules of the
          employer. For example, a truck driver stopped for eight beers in the
          middle of the afternoon, and then ran over a baby. There was a clear
          work rule against this, either express or implied. So it would seem
          that this act would not be within the scope of employment! It was held
          that the act <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">was</i> within the
          scope of employment and the employer was liable because they could
          have checked his references and found out that he had been fired from
          his previous job for drunk driving.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >There are two statutory exceptions to workers' compensation: (1) If
          you�re under chemical influence on the job, you can�t recover. (2) If
          you intentionally injure yourself, you can�t recover. One of the
          questions we�ll cover later is the issue of a truck driver who decides
          to commit suicide by driving his truck into a bigger truck on the
          highway. This is an analogy to �suicide by cop�. Clearly, there is no
          workers' compensation because he left a suicide note that was given to
          the cops. But what about respondeat superior? Does it go that far?
          Shipman doubts it very much. In the review session, we�ll say that no
          one can go to the widow and say that it�s alright and that he�ll be
          covered because it would ratify coverage
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">after the fact</i>. You must
          keep everyone�s mouth shut in order to avoid respondeat

          fiduciary and the beneficiary of the relationship. Thus, they held
          that the second type of fraud, which is basically
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">unfairness</i>, does not
          trigger the fraud exclusion. So the fraud doesn�t apply. Does the
          coverage clause cover the refund of fees? They said yes. They follow
          the maxim that insurance policies are construed, when reasonable to do
          so, to benefit the insured. The coverages are interpreted
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">broadly</i>, and the executions
          are construed
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">narrowly</i>.</span

          >What about the public policy arguments? As the firm itself, its
          ability to refund is based entirely on respondeat superior. The firm
          did not tell Perl to do what he did, and they didn�t ratify what he
          did. But, coverage of Perl, the actor, is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">against public policy</i>. When
          an insurance company covers both principal and agent, principal cannot
          recover from the agent when the principal has to pay off to a third
          party. But, the court says, the result here is $20,000 to the
          plaintiff, to be paid by the insurance company on behalf of the firm.
          How do we equalize with Perl? The answer is that when the insurance
          company pays off on behalf of the law firm to the plaintiff, they�re
          subrogated to her rights. Also, they are subrogated to the rights of
          the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">firm</i> against Mr. Perl.
          Therefore, the insurance company will cut a check to the plaintiff and
          then, on remand, the trial court is going to enter a judgment against
          Mr. Perl <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">personally </i>for
          $20,000.</span

          Two trips to the Minnesota Supreme Court could take years and tens of
          thousands of dollars. Money is always among the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">top three </i>reasons that
          people sue, but it is seldom #1, according to Shipman. The client was
          pissed off! She wanted the court to find that Perl was a bad S.O.B.
          The moral of the story is to

          Watch how a doctor practices: they are very cagey about that. They are
          always asking how you feel about things, asking you to telephone
          between visits, and telling you that you can call at home.</span

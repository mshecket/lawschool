        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          The plaintiff bought a treadmill from American Tredex. Soon after that
          purchase, Nissen bought the company, but excluded assuming any tort
          liability. Five years later, the plaintiff was injured while using the
          treadmill. A year or so after that, American Tredex was officially
          dissolved. Almost a year after that, the plaintiff sued American
          Tredex and Nissen. Nissen won summary judgment, but the plaintiff

        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Should the court adopt the �general rule of nonliability of successor
          corporations� with the four �traditional exceptions�, or should it add
          an exception for �continuity of enterprise�?</span

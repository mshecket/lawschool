<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Indemnification</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We covered the agency common
law doctrines whereby under agency law the agent is sometimes <i>entitled</i>
to indemnification from the principal without getting any deeper.  In theory,
this is a doctrine separate from <i>exoneration</i> and R.C. 1701.59(D) is a <i>pure
exoneration statute</i>.  R.C. 1701.13(E)(5)(a) is an indemnification statute. 
But there are times when a statute is <i>both </i>an exoneration and an indemnification
statute.  If, for example, a trust agreement provides that in <i>any</i> suit
against the trustee by or on behalf of the trust or its beneficiaries, the trustee
will be held <i>harmless</i> by the assets of the trust then the agreement is
both indemnification and exoneration.  But that wouldn’t be legal under trust
law.  The most that a provision in a trust agreement can exonerate the trustee
for in suits by beneficiaries is gross negligence.  Trust law is more demanding
than corporate law and more demanding than general indemnification law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>It is still fairly standard
in a tort case if there are two defendants and one is negligent while another
has committed an intentional tort like fraud, it is fairly widespread that the judgment
that the court will enter in that case is joint and several liability on the
part of both defendants to the plaintiff, but the defendant that is negligent
is entitled to indemnification from the defendant who committed the intentional
tort.  What about comparative negligence?  Case after case has held that comparative
negligence statutes by themselves do not preclude this result.  A </span><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Louisiana</span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>
court has held that you cannot apply comparative negligence to intentionality. 
But </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> cases in the past fifteen years have held that if even
if due care had been used, the intentional actor was smart enough that he would
have committed the tort anyway.  Out west and in the south, you’ll find a
number of states that have eliminated joint and several liability by statute. 
They call for percentage allocation rather than joint and several liability. 
Shipman has his doubts whether these statutes would apply when one person is
intentional and one is negligent.  He thinks that the intentional actor will be
100% liable.  But indemnification comes up a lot in torts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Moral hazard and indemnification

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A contract of indemnity is
subject to the rule that to the extent it purports to cover recklessness or
intentionality it is invalid because if, for example, Al Capone could have
gotten indemnity for the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, there would have been
twenty massacres!  In most states, insurance can cover recklessness but it can’t
cover intentionality.  In </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ohio</span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> within the past twenty years, we have had two
opinions in the cases of <i>Worth v. Aetna </i>and <i>Worth v. Huntington Bank</i>. 
What was involved was an indemnity contract whereby the contract provision
called for one party to bear the other party’s attorney’s fees.  This is the
place to start your research in </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ohio</span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> because they review the cases of the last 40 years. 
In some areas, in </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ohio</span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, you can’t even indemnify for negligence.  Generally,
though, provision for attorney’s fees is not valid.  The court held a special
situation that involved a contract for attorney’s fees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Here’s an Agent Orange case: soldiers
couldn’t sue the government, so they tried to sue government contractors. 
Scalia established a government contractor defense.  If a contractor warns the government
that the specifications will produce a defective contract, then the government contractor
has a complete defense.  The company that was one of the manufacturers of Agent
Orange sued because they had settled with veterans who had been badly injured. 
The Court of Claims decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Rehnquist
denied relief on two grounds: (1) the government contractor defense had not be
properly used by the manufacturer, and (2) the Courts of Claims, AKA the United
States Claims Court, has no equity jurisdiction and no jurisdiction in restitution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the <i>Globus</i> case,
involving the first company in the country trying to apply computers to legal
research, there had been a public offering of the company’s stock, and the
underwriter (broker-dealer firm) buying it from the company and reselling it
had extracted an indemnification agreement from the issuer.  That agreement was
carefully drafted and it excluded reckless and intentional action by the
underwriter.  You can bet that the underwriter wanted an opinion from the
lawyer for the company that the contract was valid, and the lawyer for the
company knew that on common law grounds, it would not be valid if it covered reckless
or intentional misconduct.  The underwriter got sued and had to pay a judgment
because the offering circular to the public was misleading.  The underwriter
then sued the issuer on the indemnification contract under state law.  But it
excluded reckless or intentional conduct.  It was proven at trial that the
underwriter knew of the deficiency in the offering circular!  So the opinion
should have been really short.  Instead, the court held in <i>Globus I</i> that
they would make it a federal question!  The federal securities laws themselves,
on top of state law, limit indemnification for securities misdeeds.  They
remanded to the district court for a remedy, the case came back up, and they
held in <i>Globus II</i> that under federal law, no indemnification, but they
would allow 50-50 <i>contribution</i>.  Most lawyers in their opinions will now
put in a paragraph disclaiming any opinion on indemnification where federal
securities laws are involved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When you make a public
offering, you must put in the prospectus an agreement with the SEC that the
company will not pay off unless a court first determines otherwise by
declaratory judgment.  When prosecutors go after a company they try to force
them not to indemnify their corporate executives.  That is, they would try to
force an </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ohio</span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> company <i>not</i> to pay out under R.C.
1701.13(E)(5)(a).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In a Minnesota Supreme Court
case, <i>Tomash</i>, a director of a closed-end investment company heavily
regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 was engaged in
front-running.  He had inside information on what the company was going to buy,
and so he went and bought that same stuff before the company did, and he also
sold before the company did.  That violates § 17 of the Investment Company Act
of 1940, and it’s a serious conflict of interest.  You can only engage in this
activity if the commission blesses it in advance.  The SEC sued him for an
injunction, and they got it.  But the equities aren’t all on one side.  Before
he did this, he went to the inside lawyer for the company and disclosed what he
wanted to do.  The lawyer said that it was okay!  The director then applied,
under </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minnesota</span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> law, to the company for indemnification.  The state had
a statute like R.C. 1701.13(E).  The board of directors refused under .13(E)(1)
and (2).  He goes into court to force the board to pay it.  The opinion is
mostly a reading of the statute, which says that the board <i>may</i> indemnify
in (E)(1) and (2).  Only (E)(3) has a <i>must</i>.  <i>However</i>, at the end
of the opinion, they say: “By the way…the indemnification statute says that
they will indemnify you <i>qua</i> director, and when the guy engaged in
front-running, he changed personality and became a non-corporate individual! 
In that incarnation, you’re not entitled to indemnification!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There is a New Mexico case
that follows on New Mexico’s version of (E)(3), where a big public utility
started a suit against a director, who counterclaimed and moved under FRCP Rule
65 for a TRO saying that they can’t continue their part of the suit unless they
agree to pay his attorneys’ fees.  The court held that (E)(3) means <i>exactly
what it says</i>.  It was clear there that the director was acting in his corporate
capacity.  The courts go all different ways in this area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In </span><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Toledo</span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>, a big
public company asked a guy to join their board.  Unbeknownst to the company,
Mr. X was the 100% shareholder of a closely held manufacturing company.  Under
the SEC proxy rules, he should have disclosed that to the company because it
should go into the proxy statement.  The public company entered into a lot of business
with the closely held company.  Then they found out and when to the United
States Attorney’s office, asking them to lock up Mr. X.  Mr. X paid the attorneys’
fees out of his own pocket and got an acquittal.  Then he asked for $1.5
million in attorneys’ fees under (E)(3).  The company asserted <i>Tomash</i>,
but the matter went to arbitration.  The arbitrator didn’t buy the <i>Tomash</i>
argument and entered a judgment of $1.5 million in Mr. X’s favor.  Remember
that <i>Tomash</i> is there, but it will sometimes be overlooked because it is
quite subtle.  It’s a “first cousin” of the insurance policies exclusion for
the director getting a benefit that the other shareholders don’t get in proportion
to their stock holdings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If you’re representing an
executive, your remedy is a counterclaim for attorneys’ fees, and you move
under Rule 65 for a preliminary and permanent injunction forcing the company to
pay your attorneys’ fees as the case progresses.  Merely putting that in your
answer is not enough.  You must file a motion for an immediate hearing!  Go to
the clerk or judge and ask for an early hearing on the issue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Here’s a hypothetical from
prior exams: a woman is a director of a company and she is charged with sexual
harassment.  She is the president (the #2 officer) and the #1 officer, the CEO,
calls the outside counsel and asks the counsel to investigate.  Can the regular
outside counsel do this?  Yes, assuming you have not advised the president on
this issue.  You must give the president a “<i>Miranda</i>” warning that you’re
only representing the company and not the woman.  But what if you represent the
woman?  You must file the written demand for attorneys’ fees.  But will you get
it?  There are two issues and they’re close: (1) is the internal corporate
investigation a “proceeding”?  Shipman thinks so.  (2) Does the CEO have the
power, without going to the board, to order the outside law firm to do this? 
Sure, no problem.  (3) Does this fit within (E)(5)(a)?  Shipman thinks so, but
there are equal employment overtones and if you’re the outside law firm
conducting the investigation, you have a duty to conduct a fair proceeding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The first version of R.C.
Chapter 1707 was passed in 1913.  The first state statute was in </span><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Kansas</span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> in
1912.  The Kansas Secretary of State that the farmers were being sold “so many
pieces of the blue sky”.  This is why we call state securities statutes “Blue Sky”
statutes.  There is a CCH “Blue Sky” Reporter.  The state statutes provide for registration
of securities at R.C. 1701.09, which in effect says that unless exempt, every
person must first register every security before you offer it for sale in that
state.  The exemptions in the Ohio Act are found in R.C. 1707.02 and .03.  In
the Securities Act of 1933 you’ll find the same stuff in § 3, 4, and 5.  Just
before World War I, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state
“Blue Sky” statutes.  So R.C. Chapter 1707 has a “don’t breathe” clause, and
then exemptions like .02(E).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A security listed on any
major stock exchange or listed on the national market system of NASDAQ is
exempt from registration by everybody.  But there is no comparable thing in the
federal statutes.  If GM makes a public offering, they will have to register
just like a startup company.   But that’s not the end of the story.  A big
public company like GM can use a shorter registration form and, in fact, their
offering will go through faster than an IPO because the SEC is very aware of GM
and its reputation for high solvency.  Broker-dealers must register under R.C.
1707.14.  Court cases have held that if you have more than an incidentally
small number of transactions, you’re <i>in the business</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In R.C. 1707.13, there is a
substantive fairness provision.  If the commissioner can find that the
securities are to be sold on grossly unfair terms, he can stop it.  There is no
similar provision federally.  But if you try to register federally and it’s a
real screwjob, then the SEC will delay you forever.  In R.C. 1707.29, .44 and
.45 are criminal provisions.  .44 reads like a regular high-scienter criminal statute. 
But .29 says that if you claim that you don’t have scienter because you didn’t
have <i>knowledge</i> but if a <i>reasonable investigation</i> would have
produced such knowledge, then you are <i>presumed</i> to have known what you
would have learned from a reasonable investigation.  In other words, ordinary negligence
is the mens rea!  R.C. 1707.38-.45 deals with civil liability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The first federal statute was
the Securities Act of 1933.  This deals with public offerings by companies and
their <i>affiliates</i>.  That usually includes directors, high officers, and
anyone who is a controlling person.  The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 deals
more with broker-dealers, stock exchanges, the trading markets and the NASD. 
Just what is the NASD?  It’s a Delaware-chartered not-for-profit company subject
to heavy SEC oversight which governs the “over-the-counter” (that is, not on a
stock exchange) markets.  The NASD runs <i>quotation systems</i>.  There is a
national market system which is automated.  There are also <i>other</i>
automated systems, the most prominent being the <i>bulletin board</i>.  The
smaller public companies in </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Central Ohio</span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> are found on the bulletin board.  They also have the “sheets”,
that used to be mimeographed, but now they’re more electronic.  Excluding
mutual funds, there are only 14,000 public companies.  There are 8,000 mutual
funds.  That’s out of several million business associations in the country.  How
did the NYSE come about?  They started out under a tree, then they got a
building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The first question with
regard to any federal securities act is whether it is a <i>security</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Smith v. Gross</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Here was an entrepreneur
selling earthworms.  Earlier cases had held that if you buy cattle from an
entrepreneur and he keeps and feeds them for you, then that is an investment contract. 
But if you take care of your own cattle they are not securities.  Smith brought
a suit under § 12(a)(1) under the Securities Act of 1933 for rescission.  That statute
says that if you should have registered but didn’t, the investor can rescind
and get his money back.  Of course, the investor will only rescind when the
stock goes down!  So we have a suit against the vendor of the earthworms. 
There was clearly a public offering here and Regulation D was not complied
with.  There was no registration statement.  But, of course, if there is no <i>security</i>,
then there is no recovery under the Securities Act of 1933.  They said that the
cattle cases aren’t applicable.  The court held that the only market for
earthworms was the entrepreneur buying them back when they grew up, but that’s
still an investment contract and therefore there could be a rescission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Securities and Exchange
Comm’n v. Ralston Purina Co.</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If an issuer makes a private
offering, it will be exempt.  This is called statutory 4(2).  It can apply to
any kind of company.  There is no dollar limit on statutory 4(2).  You also don’t
need to file notice with the SEC in order to perfect the exemption.  In </span><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ohio</span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>, the statute
is .03(Q), and you do have to file to perfect the exemption.  If you meet
either statutory 4(2) or .03(Q), you can pay the fee and do it.  There is a
tricky statute in </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ohio</span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> that is .03(O), which doesn’t require filing.  So you
define what the offering is, which involves “come to rest” and “integration”. 
In this case, neither party was arguing with the other over these two issues.  This
case involved no charge of fraud or unfairness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The company was a very
prosperous NYSE company in </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>St. Louis</span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> that generally had stock of increasing value from
1941 on.  They could have filed a short form with the SEC, but they didn’t. 
The S-8 is limited to public companies and its employee stock options.  That
wasn’t used.  What remedy does the SEC seek?  They only want an injunction
forcing the company to file.  This is <i>not </i>a criminal proceeding.  What
was the company doing?  They picked out employees who they thought were up and
coming, and they offered stock in the company to them.  The people who were
picked out ranged from the deck foreman to the President and CEO with a lot
inbetween.  It was a broad group of people.  In the 1930’s, the SEC general
counsel had issued his opinion that once you define what the offering is, if
the number is 25 or fewer, there will nearly always be an exemption from
registration.  If the number is 26 or greater, it will not be a private
offering.  The Supreme Court looked at the legislative history and found a congressional
statement saying that generally speaking, if you make a public offering to employees
it’s like a public offering to anyone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Court could have gone
either of two ways: (1) it could have accepted the SEC rule of thumb, saying
that the company was <i>way</i> over the 25 number, and thus there was no
private officer.  (2) It could have said that the SEC could have its own rule
of thumb, but that’s not binding on the courts.  The latter is what they
actually said.  The test for determining whether it’s public or not is the “needs
to be served” test.  If the people <i>need</i> the protections of a
registration statement (which will contain a prospectus) then whether it is to
few or many offerees, it’s a public officer.  Justice Clark tried to get more
specific, saying that if the offering were limited to people who could “fend
for themselves” and all of those people have <i>access </i>(emphasis on <i>access</i>)
to information that a registration statement would provide, then it is <i>non-public</i>
regardless of the numbers involved.  In other words, in this particular case,
had the offering been limited to the ten top officers in </span><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>St. Louis</span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>, it
would have been fine because those ten people can “fend for themselves” and
they had access to the information that a statement could provide.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Wall Street law firms
interpreted the case as saying that we can go further if Chrysler wants to sell
its 5 year notes to the 150 biggest banks in the country, they put together a <i>private
placement memorandum </i>containing the essential financial, accounting, and
narrative statements and they hold a meeting giving top representatives from those
banks access to management to ask questions, then even though there are 150
offerees then it’s private.  That’s the only good news from this case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Justice Clark’s last point
was that the burden of pleading and proving an exemption is <i>totally</i> upon
the proponent of the exemption.  That’s also true in R.C. 1701.38-.45.  Later Fifth
Circuit cases made it clear that the proponent of the exemption had to come
into court with the list of the exact names of every offeree and further proof
that nobody else was approached and show that each of those met the “needs to served”
test.  Those Fifth Circuit cases were <i>awful</i>.</span></p>

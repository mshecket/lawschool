we have non-qualified, unfunded pension plans for partners of law firms.<span

tend to create a strain between the younger partners and the older, retired partners.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most law firms today just set up the H.R. 10
plan for the self-employed and encourage partners to contribute to it.<span

provisions under § 404 for a qualified pension plan.<span

plan, but a corporation can.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you want
the other fringe benefits like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, disability, or long term

for some reason.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The question in the

he had the right to keep the firm going.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

the dealings never got on the firm records, the checks were made out to the

an earlier case of the Oregon Supreme Court, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Croisant</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The partnership
here was an accounting partnership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One
of the partnership’s clients was a wealthy businesswoman who planned to go to </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Europe</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> for three months.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She went to the partner that she usually
dealt with and told him that she would put his signature on her bank
account.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She wanted him to pay her bills
while she was out of the country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
conference was entered on the time records of the firm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The firm billed her for the work that the partner
did.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She came back from </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Europe</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> and, at first, everything
seemed okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had paid all of her legitimate
bills.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Later, however, she found out
that the partner had paid the expenses of her husband’s lover while she was
gone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was very mad!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The partner died, either by suicide or an
accident.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She clearly had a cause of
action against his estate, but the CPA firm itself was much more inviting.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The CPA firm would have had a general liability
policy and a malpractice policy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both of
these policies probably excluded anything dishonest, criminal, malicious, or intentional.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the firm was big enough that the assets
of the firm plus the personal assets of all the partners were large enough to
support a judgment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that this came
years before the LLP.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court held
that the partner’s actions <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were</i> in
the normal course of business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
should the lady have done?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She should
have required the signature of both her CPA firm and her lawyer for checks
while she was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
facts of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roach</i> itself are as follows:
there was a two person general partnership long before there were LLPs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the partners did some real estate
speculation on his own and lost his shirt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One of his clients who he serviced was rich and the lawyer hit him up
for a personal loan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The check was made
out to the partner in his personal name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The loan was never repaid, and that partner is judgment-proof.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The client gets a different lawyer, of
course.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could the client sue the one
lawyer alone and get his partnership interest?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No, because §§ 15-38 of the Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 state that
an individual creditor of a partner can levy upon the partnership interest,
which allows a kind of weird remedy: a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charging
order</i> on his earnings from the partnership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shipman thinks this would include both a guaranteed salary and a share
of profits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He’s pretty sure that the
restrictions on wage garnishment would not apply because a partner’s earnings
or salary are not wages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
different than a share of stock: you can’t cause the interest to be paid over
and cause a dissolution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore,
the other partner or partners can redeem the partner’s interest.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman says that it’s not a great
remedy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Partnership or LLC interest is
basically not good collateral.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
lawyer sued the partnership under §§ 1-18 and 40 saying that there was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>negligence</i> in what the partner did, and that
the negligence led to the client’s loss.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He served both partners individually as well as the law firm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He claimed that the partnership itself was liable
as was the innocent partner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Negligence
was used to dig into the malpractice policy of the law firm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He claimed that what the lawyer did was negligence
only.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What rules of professional ethics
were violated?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Canon 5 and the rules thereunder
tell us that one of the stupidest things a lawyer can do is enter into personal
or financial relationships with clients.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It is clear that a lawyer must give all kinds of warnings of the dangers
of a personal loan to the client.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here,
the lawyer did not inform the client that he ought to insist on a first
mortgage on the lawyer’s house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The rule
is even stricter with trustees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
court holds that the partnership and the other partner are on the hook.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dealt with in real estate believe that he is the sole owner of the property.<span

is also a Texas Court of Civil Appeals case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We have a 50-50 partnership between two partners in a profitable business.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no partnership agreement except for the
agreement on the 50-50 split on profits and losses.<span

widow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The living partner loved the business
and wanted to keep it operating.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
bank signature cards allowed either partner to sign and thus there was no
practical problem with continuing the business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What are the widow’s options at this point given the lack of a formal partnership
agreement except for the 50-50 split?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Either
the widow or the living partner could force an immediate auction block sale of
the partnership’s assets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, such
sales sacrifice value, so they are rarely used.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If the widow and living partner wanted to negotiate with the widow in
the place of the dead partner, they could do so, but the widow didn’t want to.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The business could simply be continued, and if
the living partner treats the widow as a substitute for the dead partner and vice
versa, then under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Blumer Brewing</i>,
they will be considered 50-50 partners, with the widow taking the position of
her husband.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
possibility that comes out here is that the living partner continues the business,
but the widow forces him to send out letters to everybody saying that the dead partner
is dead and that the living partner is continuing the business.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is done because you don’t want the widow
getting sued as an apparent partner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§
31-38 contemplates this possibility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Act says that she will not be liable as a partner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She has a creditor’s claim on the assets, but
that claim is subordinated to the regular old creditors of the partnership.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is true even if the old name is
continued (as is often the case with law firms).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Within a reasonable time, the partnership
must pay off the widow with the value of the capital account.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are two big issues: (1) do we use book
value GAAP figures based on historical costs, or (2) do we use fair market
value figures?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court holds that in
the absence of an agreement (which would be binding under the Act), it was held
that fair market value would be used.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
ruling implies that goodwill will be computed and included in the equation
because a store that has been around for a long time creates goodwill.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
case is troublesome in a way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Texas Supreme
Court had a case called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mattie Carruth
Bird</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was the general partner in
a real estate limited partnership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her
capital account had a negative balance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How could this be?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re
using GAAP historical cost figures and you take out a second mortgage on real
estate and then distribute the proceeds to the partners, you’ll have negative
capital account balances.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That doesn’t
mean the business is in trouble.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The limited
partner sued to force her executor to pay into the capital account.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court interpreted the Uniform Partnership
Act of 1914 and Uniform Limited Partnership Act literally and agreed with the limited
partner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The second big holding was that
the executor of the deceased partner has the option to take interest from the
date of death until payoff, or if they elect to do so in a timely matter they
can get their share of profits for that period.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Early on, the lawyer made the correct election, because this was a very
profitable partnership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that under
§ 38, a partnership agreement providing for book value over two, three or four
years would prevail over §§ 31-38.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
provisions of the Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 are default provisions that
can be trumped by an agreement to the contrary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

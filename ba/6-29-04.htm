          >Here we have non-qualified, unfunded pension plans for partners of
          law firms. They are becoming less common because they tend to create a
          strain between the younger partners and the older, retired partners.
          Most law firms today just set up the H.R. 10 plan for the
          self-employed and encourage partners to contribute to it. This plan is
          not nearly as liberal as the provisions under � 404 for a qualified
          pension plan. A partnership cannot have a qualified pension plan, but
          a corporation can. If you want the other fringe benefits like Blue
          Cross/Blue Shield, disability, or long term care, you must go to a Sub
          C corporation. There are a few law firms that do it, but it is more
          common physicians for some reason. The question in the case was the
          non-qualified plan provided that it ended when the firm ended. The
          plaintiff was a retired who had moved to </span

          and was getting $27,000 a year out of the pension plan. The firm
          entered into a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">disastrous</i> amalgamation
          with another partnership, became insolvent, and went out of business.
          The plaintiff sued, claiming that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">somehow</i>, either in tort or
          contract law, he had the right to keep the firm going. But the plan
          itself provided that it terminated if the firm went out of existence.
          There was no fraud or bad faith. There is also no wrongful,
          intentional interference with a contract. The court holds that the
          partnership will not be kept open.</span

          firm. A partner decided he wasn�t making enough from the firm alone.
          He started confidential conferences with rich old ladies and told them
          he was running his own private investment operation on the side. He
          wanted the checks made payable to him alone. This did not appear on
          the law firm time records. No one else at the firm knew or had reason
          to know of his activities. Note that for purposes of the securities
          laws he was selling an investment contract. Most law firms
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">absolutely</i> prohibit
          anything approaching this. If he had taken the money and made a profit
          for the clients, probably no one would have sued. But people who do
          this kind of thing are probably more or less perpetrating a fraud, and
          this fellow was no exception. He embezzled his clients� money. He got
          caught and went to state prison. The old ladies were out a lot of
          money. They had an action again him, of course, for the breach of his
          fiduciary duty, but he had spent all their money already. Then they
          sued the law firm. They latched onto �� 9-18 of the Uniform
          Partnership Act of 1914, which impose a respondeat superior regime
          upon acts in the ordinary course of business. Since the dealings never
          got on the firm records, the checks were made out to the individual
          attorney, and there was no evidence that the other partners knew or
          had reason to know of his dealings, the court holds that the law firm
          is off the hook.</span

        <span
          >Here we have different facts. This case cites an earlier case of the
          Oregon Supreme Court,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Croisant</i>. The partnership
          here was an accounting partnership. One of the partnership�s clients
          was a wealthy businesswoman who planned to go to </span
        ><st1:place><span>Europe</span></st1:place
        ><span>
          for three months. She went to the partner that she usually dealt with
          and told him that she would put his signature on her bank account. She
          wanted him to pay her bills while she was out of the country. This
          conference was entered on the time records of the firm. The firm
          billed her for the work that the partner did. She came back from </span
        ><st1:place><span>Europe</span></st1:place
        ><span>
          and, at first, everything seemed okay. He had paid all of her
          legitimate bills. Later, however, she found out that the partner had
          paid the expenses of her husband�s lover while she was gone. She was
          very mad! The partner died, either by suicide or an accident. She
          clearly had a cause of action against his estate, but the CPA firm
          itself was much more inviting. The CPA firm would have had a general
          liability policy and a malpractice policy. Both of these policies
          probably excluded anything dishonest, criminal, malicious, or
          intentional. But the firm was big enough that the assets of the firm
          plus the personal assets of all the partners were large enough to
          support a judgment. Note that this came years before the LLP. The
          court held that the partner�s actions
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">were</i> in the normal course
          of business. What should the lady have done? She should have required
          the signature of both her CPA firm and her lawyer for checks while she
          was gone.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The facts of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Roach</i> itself
          are as follows: there was a two person general partnership long before
          there were LLPs. One of the partners did some real estate speculation
          on his own and lost his shirt. One of his clients who he serviced was
          rich and the lawyer hit him up for a personal loan. The check was made
          out to the partner in his personal name. The loan was never repaid,
          and that partner is judgment-proof. The client gets a different
          lawyer, of course. Could the client sue the one lawyer alone and get
          his partnership interest? No, because �� 15-38 of the Uniform
          Partnership Act of 1914 state that an individual creditor of a partner
          can levy upon the partnership interest, which allows a kind of weird
          remedy: a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">charging order</i> on
          his earnings from the partnership. Shipman thinks this would include
          both a guaranteed salary and a share of profits. He�s pretty sure that
          the restrictions on wage garnishment would not apply because a
          partner�s earnings or salary are not wages. This is different than a
          share of stock: you can�t cause the interest to be paid over and cause
          a dissolution. Furthermore, the other partner or partners can redeem
          the partner�s interest. Shipman says that it�s not a great remedy.
          Partnership or LLC interest is basically not good collateral.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The lawyer sued the partnership under �� 1-18 and 40 saying that
          there was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">negligence</i> in
          what the partner did, and that the negligence led to the client�s
          loss. He served both partners individually as well as the law firm. He
          claimed that the partnership itself was liable as was the innocent
          partner. Negligence was used to dig into the malpractice policy of the
          law firm. He claimed that what the lawyer did was negligence only.
          What rules of professional ethics were violated? Canon 5 and the rules
          thereunder tell us that one of the stupidest things a lawyer can do is
          enter into personal or financial relationships with clients. It is
          clear that a lawyer must give all kinds of warnings of the dangers of
          a personal loan to the client. Here, the lawyer did not inform the
          client that he ought to insist on a first mortgage on the lawyer�s
          house. The rule is even stricter with trustees. The court holds that
          the partnership and the other partner are on the hook.</span

        <span
          >This is a partnership opportunity case. There was a capitalist and
          sweat equity who get together around 1900. Sweat Equity is a real
          estate expert. Sweat Equity wants Capitalist to advance some money.
          They plan to go 50-50 on earnings. All the assets were put in Sweat
          Equity�s name. Capitalist was a �<i
            style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >secret partner</i
          >� of the general partnership. Most people think that secret partners
          are just as liable as regular partners. Sub-partnership leads to the
          same result: Smith is a general partner in a construction firm. He
          goes to his brother and he and the brother enter into a
          sub-partnership in Smith�s share of the partnership. It is generally
          held that Smith�s brother will be held liable just like any other
          general partner. Many lawyers in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          will tell the bank if it wants to levy on a general partnership
          interest that it may well have the same liability for the partnership
          debts and obligations as their debtor has.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>The law is not clear on this.
          Was there any tax impact upon the formation of this partnership? It
          was before the federal income tax was enacted, but let�s presume this
          happened in the present. The Internal Revenue Code says that if the
          person contributing property has his capital account credited for the
          fair market value of the property and if Sweat Equity doesn�t receive
          an addition to his capital account because of services, then the
          transaction will be tax-free.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Over 12-15 years there were rocky times, but Sweat Equity generally
          did well. The only problem was that Sweat Equity didn�t have a lot of
          money. People who he�s dealt with in real estate believe that he is
          the sole owner of the property. The partnership with the capitalist
          may have been a handshake deal, and it wasn�t known by many people.
          Just before the end of the term of the partnership, a third party
          proposed a massive redevelopment project for </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>New York City</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          to Sweat Equity. Most of the money was going to be borrowed. Sweat
          Equity formed a corporation, of which he owned 100% of the stock, to
          run his end of the development. After the end of the partnership, the
          capitalist finds out about this and gets really mad. Cardozo holds
          that Sweat Equity had a duty to inform Capitalist of the opportunity.
          Cardozo said that Capitalist can have 49% of the stock of the property
          for what Sweat Equity paid per share. Sweat Equity will run the
          business, and Capitalist must sign the guarantee with Sweat
          Equity.</span

        <b><span>Dissolution of the partnership</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Read �� 14-38 carefully to understand dissolution. Two of the key
          sections are �� 31-32. When you read them, you find a big split
          between two kinds of dissolution: (1) rightful and (2) wrongful
          dissolution. Fiduciary duties are very important in either case and
          can cause some odd results. The first question is: can you, by
          contract, create a partnership for a term that cannot be dissolved
          during that term? In other words, can you create a true agency coupled
          with an interest that is irrevocable? No, you definitely cannot.
          Another way to put it is that you can�t go into court and get a
          mandatory injunction forcing people to stay with the partnership if
          they want to leave.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This case illustrates that there is such a thing as
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">wrongful dissolution</i>. If
          there is a wrongful dissolution, two bad things happen to the
          wrongdoer: (1) the bad guy loses all of his interest in the goodwill
          of the business and (2) he is subject to an action for breach of
          contract by the other partners. In this case, Sweat Equity met with
          Capitalist with the idea of building a big new cafeteria. Sweat Equity
          didn�t have any money, but he had ideas and experience. Capitalist had
          a lot of money. A deal like this today would be set up in the LLC form
          and it would be malpractice per se for a lawyer not to force the
          actors into this form. The deal was that there was a partner�s salary
          for Sweat Equity because Sweat Equity needed money to live on. The
          partnership agreement said that during phase one, the building, no
          loss of the partnership would be allocated to Sweat Equity. That�s
          clearly legal and this type of agreement is a typical way to do it. In
          phase two, when the cafeteria starts running, Sweat Equity�s salary
          continues, while all profits are allocated to Capitalist until he has
          recovered all the losses that were allocated to him in phase one. In
          phase three, the partnership salary continues, but both profits and
          losses are equally distributed. At that point, Sweat Equity is
          bearing, indirectly, one-half of the salary to him.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Capitalist had good lawyers and a mortgage on Sweat Equity�s
          partnership interest as well as many other legal protections.
          Capitalist got mad and wanted to dissolve the partnership. When you
          read �� 31-32, you find that if no term is specified for a
          partnership, either party can get rightful dissolution at any time.
          But that �out� is not available to Capitalist. According to several </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          cases, where a definite term isn�t specified but a project is
          specified, there is an implied term of years for the time needed to do
          the project. Another case held that where one party theoretically can
          rightfully dissolve at will, fiduciary duty override applies if
          dissolution would be unfair to the other partner. According to ��
          31-32, another �out� is when the business can no longer be carried out
          at a profit. Under </span

          ><st1:place><span>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          law, dissolution itself is in equity, but Capitalist joined claimed
          for money damages. In </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          and federal courts, there will usually be a jury and the jury findings
          on the damage claims (at law) will be collateral estoppel (issue
          preclusion) on the judge when he sits in equity.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The special issues submitted to the jury were the following: (1) Can
          this business be successfully carried on at a profit? (2) If not,
          whose fault is it? The jury found that the business could not be
          carried on at a profit and that it was Capitalist�s fault. The trial
          judge, based on these special issues, entered an order that there was
          no ground for rightful dissolution. The case goes to the Texas Court
          of Civil Appeals, which affirms. Capitalist claims that there is no
          such thing as a partnership that cannot be dissolved. But the Court of
          Civil Appeals says that all the trial judge held was that there were
          no grounds for
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">rightful </i>dissolution. He
          could still take a stab at

          >This is also a Texas Court of Civil Appeals case. We have a 50-50
          partnership between two partners in a profitable business. There is no
          partnership agreement except for the agreement on the 50-50 split on
          profits and losses. One partner dies. He left all of his property to
          his widow. The living partner loved the business and wanted to keep it
          operating. The bank signature cards allowed either partner to sign and
          thus there was no practical problem with continuing the business. What
          are the widow�s options at this point given the lack of a formal
          partnership agreement except for the 50-50 split? Either the widow or
          the living partner could force an immediate auction block sale of the
          partnership�s assets. However, such sales sacrifice value, so they are
          rarely used. If the widow and living partner wanted to negotiate with
          the widow in the place of the dead partner, they could do so, but the
          widow didn�t want to. The business could simply be continued, and if
          the living partner treats the widow as a substitute for the dead
          partner and vice versa, then under
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Blumer Brewing</i>, they will
          be considered 50-50 partners, with the widow taking the position of
          her husband.</span

        <span
          >The possibility that comes out here is that the living partner
          continues the business, but the widow forces him to send out letters
          to everybody saying that the dead partner is dead and that the living
          partner is continuing the business. This is done because you don�t
          want the widow getting sued as an apparent partner. � 31-38
          contemplates this possibility. The Act says that she will not be
          liable as a partner. She has a creditor�s claim on the assets, but
          that claim is subordinated to the regular old creditors of the
          partnership. This is true even if the old name is continued (as is
          often the case with law firms). Within a reasonable time, the
          partnership must pay off the widow with the value of the capital
          account. There are two big issues: (1) do we use book value GAAP
          figures based on historical costs, or (2) do we use fair market value
          figures? The court holds that in the absence of an agreement (which
          would be binding under the Act), it was held that fair market value
          would be used. The ruling implies that goodwill will be computed and
          included in the equation because a store that has been around for a
          long time creates goodwill. It may be different for lawyers.</span

          >The case is troublesome in a way. The Texas Supreme Court had a case
          called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Mattie Carruth Bird</i>.
          She was the general partner in a real estate limited partnership. Her
          capital account had a negative balance. How could this be? If you�re
          using GAAP historical cost figures and you take out a second mortgage
          on real estate and then distribute the proceeds to the partners,
          you�ll have negative capital account balances. That doesn�t mean the
          business is in trouble. The limited partner sued to force her executor
          to pay into the capital account. The court interpreted the Uniform
          Partnership Act of 1914 and Uniform Limited Partnership Act literally
          and agreed with the limited partner. The second big holding was that
          the executor of the deceased partner has the option to take interest
          from the date of death until payoff, or if they elect to do so in a
          timely matter they can get their share of profits for that period.
          Early on, the lawyer made the correct election, because this was a
          very profitable partnership. Note that under � 38, a partnership
          agreement providing for book value over two, three or four years would
          prevail over �� 31-38. The provisions of the Uniform Partnership Act
          of 1914 are default provisions that can be trumped by an agreement to
          the contrary.</span

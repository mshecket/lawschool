station.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case shows why investors
should get a letter from the corporate lawyer stating that the corporation is
validly and duly created under state law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The two guys wrote checks to the promoter, who promised to form a corporation,
but never did.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The promoter goes to the
owner of the service station and enters into contracts under the name: “Kunkel
d/b/a Kunkel’s, Inc.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, he never
went to the Secretary of State and he never filed a charter!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
business went belly up!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller of
the gas station wasn’t paid!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the
seller sues the promoter and the two investors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The testimony at trial was disputed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are six different theories the lawyer and client will usually put
forward: (1) general partnership, (2) agency, (3) joint enterprise, (4) statute,
(5) third party beneficiary, and (6) guaranty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
joint enterprise theory, like agency, covers both profit-making activities and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all other </i>activities (i.e. not just business
activities).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is some case law in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> suggesting that joint
enterprise is alive and well!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here’s a
hypo showing how this theory might be used: two guys, Jones and Smith, go
hunting in Jones’s car.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They have a
hunting license.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’re hunting during
the deer season and they agree that if they kill a deer, they’ll take it back,
dress it, put it in cold storage, and then sell the meat.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is that a partnership?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it’s an isolated incident mixing business
and pleasure, it will almost never be a partnership.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Partnership is co-ownership of a business for
a profit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But on the other hand, the
courts have applied partnership to lottery tickets!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One guy gives $5 to another guy at a bar to
buy a $10 ticket.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other guy buys it
and wins big.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court has found that
they are partners!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
joint enterprise theory is never applied to the ordinary carpool to work.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Imagine Jones is driving his car, is negligent,
and runs over a baby who is not negligent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jones is judgment-proof, but Smith is wealthy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiff’s lawyer is looking for someone
who will bleed green.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The plaintiff sues
Jones and Smith jointly and severally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In many states, the plaintiff will win, but in other states the theory
has been pushed backwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>If
there is co-ownership of a business for profit, it fits the general partnership
statute, and you can reach all the partners individually.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another category is the third-party
beneficiary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It may be that contractual
dealings between the capitalist and sweat equity have created a third-party
beneficiary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they have, a third-party
beneficiary can sue in contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
next-to-last theory you look at is guaranty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If Smith, Inc. goes under, but Mr. Smith, the 100% owner, has guaranteed
the debts of the company, then you can sue Mr. Smith.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In some states, the statute of frauds may be
waived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>In
the present case, if you read the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Wyoming</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> statute on defective
formation carefully, it seems to say that people who act like a corporation
even though they’re not approved to be one will be jointly and severally liable
for the corporation’s debts and liabilities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Here, the two outside investors are a bit difficult to put in the
category of mere inactive investors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s
not as though someone is going to his uncle and is getting a $5,000 loan.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not 100% clear, but Shipman’s reading is
that they disregard the statute and go to the theory of estoppel because when
the entrepreneur failed to make his monthly payments on what he had borrowed,
Frontier sued him in his individual capacity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They sued Kunkel d/b/a Kunkel, Inc. and got judgment against him in his
individual capacity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The paperwork that
he signed with Frontier was all signed that way, and the court’s holding is
based on estoppel. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>They simply hold that
because the fellow was dealt with as an individual, the Model Act provision
that might have made the investors jointly and severally liable was
inapplicable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman thinks it’s a
close case and the investors took a big risk.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They should have gotten a lawyer!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(Of course.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Ultra
vires and “no authority of agent” are two different defenses. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Let us see why.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ultra vires means that the corporation <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>itself</i>, acting through all of its organs
(officers, directors, and shareholders) simply does not have the power.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, when you say that the
agent did not have actual or apparent authority, it’s entirely separate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The corporation is saying that the action is
something that the directors and/or shareholders should have approved.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is quite separate, though related to ultra
vires at times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Suppose
a particular corporate action is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>illegal</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman believes that it is a separate defense
from the other two, though it is very closely related.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re trying to enjoin an action as a shareholder,
and the directors have violated a statute, you will usually add <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>illegality</i> as a count of your suit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The question will be: does the statute, as
interpreted by the court, give <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>standing</i>
to a shareholder to raise the illegality issue?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It depends!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This question usually
comes up under the rubric of “implied private right of action”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We use torts lingo.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that illegality includes criminality but
is broader than criminality.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If certain
conduct violates a criminal statute, the conduct will be both criminal and
illegal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if it only violates a civil
statute, the conduct will not be criminal but will still be illegal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Note
that sometimes this is part of contracts lingo, though under a different name.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a contract is void as against public
policy, either party may get a judicial determination stopping the prospective
performance of that contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
similar but different from the “implied private right of action”.<span

private rights of action beyond what we the legislature have expressly

officers’ and directors’ liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

        <span
          >We�re on premature commencement, de facto, de jure, and all that
          stuff. Last time, we had worked our way through Assignment 10(d) and
          cases under the old Model Business Corporation Act. Under that
          Draconian and straightforward position, are you going to hold
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">mere inactive investors</i> to
          the same liability standard that you hold active investors? The courts
          said no, because the very purpose of corporate statutes is to
          encourage investment especially by inactive investors and you don�t
          want to be Draconian. Note that in </span
        ><st1:State

          statutes such R.C. 1701.922 (only a dozen years old, and which mirrors

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">extremely protective</i>, and
          after giving a lot of protection in the statute, it states that it
          does not limit or displace common law doctrines such as de facto,

      <p>
        <span
          >This case arises in a state that had the old Model Act formula:
          �digital, either one or zero; either you�re perfectly formed, or
          you�re <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">out of it, baby</i>�. We
          had odd facts. They�ll blow your mind! Just what are the facts here? A
          promoter wanted to start a gas station. Kunkel needed additional money
          and he went to two prospective investors: </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Fairfield</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          and Beach. He asked them to invest in the gas station. This case shows
          why investors should get a letter from the corporate lawyer stating
          that the corporation is validly and duly created under state law. The
          two guys wrote checks to the promoter, who promised to form a
          corporation, but never did. The promoter goes to the owner of the
          service station and enters into contracts under the name: �Kunkel
          d/b/a Kunkel�s, Inc.� However, he never went to the Secretary of State
          and he never filed a charter!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The business went belly up! The seller of the gas station wasn�t
          paid! So the seller sues the promoter and the two investors. The
          testimony at trial was disputed. There are six different theories the
          lawyer and client will usually put forward: (1) general partnership,
          (2) agency, (3) joint enterprise, (4) statute, (5) third party
          beneficiary, and (6) guaranty.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The joint enterprise theory, like agency, covers both profit-making
          activities and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">all other </i>activities (i.e.
          not just business activities). There is some case law in </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          suggesting that joint enterprise is alive and well! Here�s a hypo
          showing how this theory might be used: two guys, Jones and Smith, go
          hunting in Jones�s car. They have a hunting license. They�re hunting
          during the deer season and they agree that if they kill a deer,
          they�ll take it back, dress it, put it in cold storage, and then sell
          the meat. Is that a partnership? If it�s an isolated incident mixing
          business and pleasure, it will almost never be a partnership.
          Partnership is co-ownership of a business for a profit. But on the
          other hand, the courts have applied partnership to lottery tickets!
          One guy gives $5 to another guy at a bar to buy a $10 ticket. The
          other guy buys it and wins big. The court has found that they are
          partners!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The joint enterprise theory is never applied to the ordinary carpool
          to work. Imagine Jones is driving his car, is negligent, and runs over
          a baby who is not negligent. Jones is judgment-proof, but Smith is
          wealthy. The plaintiff�s lawyer is looking for someone who will bleed
          green. The plaintiff sues Jones and Smith jointly and severally. In
          many states, the plaintiff will win, but in other states the theory
          has been pushed backwards.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If there is co-ownership of a business for profit, it fits the
          general partnership statute, and you can reach all the partners
          individually. Another category is the third-party beneficiary. It may
          be that contractual dealings between the capitalist and sweat equity
          have created a third-party beneficiary. If they have, a third-party
          beneficiary can sue in contract. The next-to-last theory you look at
          is guaranty. If Smith, Inc. goes under, but Mr. Smith, the 100% owner,
          has guaranteed the debts of the company, then you can sue Mr. Smith.
          In some states, the statute of frauds may be waived.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>In the present case, if you read the </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Wyoming</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          statute on defective formation carefully, it seems to say that people
          who act like a corporation even though they�re not approved to be one
          will be jointly and severally liable for the corporation�s debts and
          liabilities. Here, the two outside investors are a bit difficult to
          put in the category of mere inactive investors. It�s not as though
          someone is going to his uncle and is getting a $5,000 loan. It�s not
          100% clear, but Shipman�s reading is that they disregard the statute
          and go to the theory of estoppel because when the entrepreneur failed
          to make his monthly payments on what he had borrowed, Frontier sued
          him in his individual capacity. They sued Kunkel d/b/a Kunkel, Inc.
          and got judgment against him in his individual capacity. The paperwork
          that he signed with Frontier was all signed that way, and the court�s
          holding is based on estoppel.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>They simply hold that because
          the fellow was dealt with as an individual, the Model Act provision
          that might have made the investors jointly and severally liable was
          inapplicable. Shipman thinks it�s a close case and the investors took
          a big risk. They should have gotten a lawyer! (Of course.)</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Ultra vires and �no authority of agent� are two different defenses.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>Let us see why. Ultra vires
          means that the corporation
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">itself</i>, acting through all
          of its organs (officers, directors, and shareholders) simply does not
          have the power. On the other hand, when you say that the agent did not
          have actual or apparent authority, it�s entirely separate. The
          corporation is saying that the action is something that the directors
          and/or shareholders should have approved. This is quite separate,
          though related to ultra vires at times.</span

        <span
          >Suppose a particular corporate action is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">illegal</i>. Shipman believes
          that it is a separate defense from the other two, though it is very
          closely related. If you�re trying to enjoin an action as a
          shareholder, and the directors have violated a statute, you will
          usually add <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">illegality</i> as a
          count of your suit. The question will be: does the statute, as
          interpreted by the court, give
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">standing</i> to a shareholder
          to raise the illegality issue? It depends! This question usually comes
          up under the rubric of �implied private right of action�. We use torts
          lingo. Note that illegality includes criminality but is broader than
          criminality. If certain conduct violates a criminal statute, the
          conduct will be both criminal and illegal. But if it only violates a
          civil statute, the conduct will not be criminal but will still be
          illegal.</span

          corporation formed in 1921 to do manufacturing, states the purpose in
          its charter to manufacture industrial goods. It has never amended its
          charter to broaden that purpose. Two items come before the board of
          directors. I�m the outside legal counsel for X, Inc., and the board of
          directors and officers want my opinion on both items. First, one of
          the officers thinks that investing $500,000 in the capital stock of a
          big NYSE natural gas company would be a good investment. The directors
          ask me whether this would be ultra vires. In R.C. 1701.13, a lot of
          powers are given to the corporation and they don�t need to be copied
          into the charter to be valid. Generally speaking, according to the
          statute, ultra vires cannot be raised as a defense by the corporation
          itself, but that the provision does not limit quo warranto actions by
          the state. The provision also doesn�t limit officers� and directors�
          liability. Finally, non-complicit minority shareholders of the company
          can bring injunctive actions to prevent ultra vires contracts from
          being performed so long as the judgment setting aside the contract is
          not grossly unfair to the other party to the contract.</span

          is that for companies like X, investing as a pure investor without

          There are two people who can come after you: the state can come after
          you in a quo warranto action. Also, if what you�re proposing may
          violate agreements with creditors and the creditors don�t assent, then

          touch that opinion �with a 50-foot pole�! There are six or seven
          theories out there for disregard of the corporate fiction. You can
          discuss with a client the things they can do to minimize the problem,

          corporate fiction because legislatures have purposefully set up
          corporate statutes and other statutes to encourage investment by
          inactive investors. The very first thing that an inactive investor
          wants is assurance that you can only lose what you put into a stock
          and no more. For example, consider the case of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Abbott v. Post</i> from 1940.
          This case involved the pre-1933 National Bank Act dealing with
          insolvency of national banks. Before 1933, national banks had to issue
          $100 par common stock. That means the shareholders had to pay at least
          $100 per share of stock to the company when it was issued. The act
          also provided that if the bank went insolvent, each shareholder could
          be assessed up to par.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">preferred stock</i> of the

          veterans seeking inexpensive housing. The not-for-profit cooperative
          formed a 100% owned stock subsidiary which constructed houses and sold
          them without profit to the veterans who were members of the parent
          cooperative. There is no fraud or �sham� alleged (those are two of the
          seven possibilities for piercing the corporate veil). A �sham� is more
          of a legal conclusion than an aid to analysis, while fraud has some
          legal substance to it. But neither one was alleged. What was alleged
          was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">undercapitalization</i> of
          the stock subsidiary. The contract creditors of the subsidiary, which
          went insolvent, wanted to reach the assets of the not-for-profit
          parent on the ground that the subsidiary was undercapitalized. They
          also alleged and pretty much proved that the subsidiary could never
          make a profit because the deal, from day one, was to make inexpensive
          houses sold without a markup to impecunious veterans who are members

          law says that if there�s no fraud or sham, then it means that the
          financial statements of the company were reasonably accurate and
          therefore anyone doing the business of the subsidiary could have
          gotten signed, written guarantees from the parent which would have
          been fully enforceable. However, they didn�t do so.

        <span

          arguments similar to two tax problems that this setup would have. From
          a tax standpoint, the commissioner of internal revenue could attack it
          in two ways: first, they could use � 482, where you have two or more
          persons or entities under common control or where one controls the
          other. The commissioner may reallocate items of income, expense, and
          deductions so as to fairly reflect income. The Internal Revenue
          Service could have come in here and said that the houses were worth
          $8,000 but were being sold for $6,000. It could have allocated $2,000
          as dividends to the member of the cooperative parent saying that the
          difference is an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">implied dividend</i>. The
          dissent argues that this same line of reasoning should apply on the
          disregard of the corporate fiction theory. The majority hears the
          argument but doesn�t find it persuasive. There are real tax problems
          here!</span

          torts cases than in contracts cases because a contract creditor could
          always, in theory, insist upon a guarantee by the controlling person
          or persons. In this case, too, there is no fraud or sham alleged. It�s
          clearly another undercapitalized corporation. It�s also pretty much
          like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bartle</i> in that this

          development came along, they went �over the abyss� into �financial
          hell�, or in other words, they went insolvent. Remember that if you

          there was no express
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">written</i> guarantee by the

          frauds says that a promise to answer for the debts of another must be
          in a signed writing. The defendant says that this is just crap! It�s
          not in writing and it�s not signed.
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">But</i>, in the last 100 years,
          the statute of frauds has
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">softened</i> a good bit, though
          not totally. For example, if you write out a check with a notation of
          what property it�s for and what the purchase price is and you hand it
          to the other guy, even if he doesn�t cash it, it�s held to be a signed
          memorandum. It describes the land and the price, so it�s found to
          satisfy the statute of frauds. Also, there is the doctrine of part
          performance, which can get you out from under the statute of frauds.
          When a major or 100% shareholder of a corporation makes a statement
          such as: �I will stand by my corporation!� The court says that he�s
          not answering for the debts of another, but rather he�s answering for
          his own debts. Post-1980, we have an Ohio Court of Appeals case
          stating exactly that.</span

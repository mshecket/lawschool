          to public and non-public, registered and non-registered transactions.
          There is a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">semblance</i> of a
          privity requirement. You must prove that the shares you bought
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">came out of </i>the registered
          public offering. You don�t have to be the first purchaser. You could
          be the second, third, fourth or fifth. That requirement doesn�t help
          us in the question because all the shares in the public market came
          out of the registered public offering. You should always check the
          statute of limitations; in many cases people wait too long to sue. In
          this case, we can expect that the suits will be filed within the next

          went public during that period. Unfortunately, about nine months after

          reasonably believed the prospectus narrative material to be true. As
          to the expert material, the test is different. There is no requirement
          of reasonable investigation as to the certified financials. The test
          is simple: did the director reasonably believe the certified
          financials to be true? In the real world, a lot of material crosses

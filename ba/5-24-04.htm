          currency, which can be used by the bearer for all debts, public and
          private, and there is no record at the Treasury of who has dollar
          bills at any one time. It�s the same for all sizes of bills! In civil
          law countries (basically the rest of the world aside from the
          English-speaking countries), it�s not so. Both stock certificates and
          bonds are typically issued in bearer form. If you have a bearer bond
          from a big company in </span

          interest? Shipman has been told that you make sure you don�t lose the
          bearer bond! You take it to a designated bank twice a
          <span class="GramE">year,</span> and they�ll stamp the back of your
          bond and give you cash. They�ll also photocopy the bond. This is very

        <span
          >What about voting with bearer stock? It�s a similar process. You take
          the certificate to a certain bank before the shareholder meeting, you
          get a ballot, and you cast a vote. They make a checkmark on the back
          of the certificate saying that the vote for the current meeting has
          already been cast. In English speaking countries, this isn�t
          allowed.</span

        <span

          words, the exact opposite of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">bearer</i> form. The company
          maintains books known as
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">stock transfer books</i>.
          Sometimes this is delegated to an independent bank known as the

        ><span>
          law, if it�s a cash dividend, the declaration creates a debt and the
          company can�t back out unless the resolution itself states otherwise
          (and that�s very rare). Let�s say that the board meets on April 1 and
          declares a semi-annual dividend. April 1 is the declaration date. The
          second date is the actual
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">payment date</i>. Let�s say
          they choose July 1. They will also select a date between the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">declaration</i> and
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">payment date</i> when the
          dividend will be payable to holders of record, for example, May
          15<sup>th</sup>. The choice of the dates and the spacing is governed
          by NASD, NYSE, AMEX, and SEC rules. Under Rule 10b, it�s a fraud not
          to comply with the rules of the NASD and the exchanges if you are a
          public company. Once you notify the NASD and exchanges of the
          dividend, they will set a date by which the stock will become ex
          dividend, that is, a date by which a person purchasing it doesn�t get
          a dividend. How are dividends paid in the </span

      <p>
        <span
          >The governing law concerning the transfer of stock certificates and
          registered debt is found in three places: Uniform Commercial Code
          Articles 1, 8, and 9; ORC � 1701.04-.37 (sprinkled throughout), and
          the rules of NASD, NYSE, and AMEX. Most of the time, the former two
          sources will agree completely. Once in a while, though, there may be
          some slack between the two. It usually doesn�t cause a problem, but it
          does every once in a while.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Article 8 classifies stock in corporations as
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">investment securities</i>.
          Nearly all courts will say that close corporation stock, even though
          it�s not publicly traded, is of a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">type</i> that is publicly
          traded, and thus they will apply Articles 8, 9 and 1 in full. A very
          small number of cases will deviate from this approach. What�s
          important about investment securities? The big deal is that it�s just
          like the Record Acts! A
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">bona fide purchaser</i> is
          someone who gives consideration, acts in good faith, and who is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> on notice of an adverse
          claim.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s say bank B lends Mr. Smith $100,000 on Mr. Smith�s GE stock
          certificates. Smith takes the certificates to bank B and endorses them
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in blank</i>, meaning, he
          doesn�t say who he�s endorsing to. The bank will put on a signature
          guarantee, in case they have to foreclose on the pledge and sell the
          stock. The NYSE rules require a guarantee of signature from an NYSE
          member firm or a bank. The loan officer is negligent and puts the
          certificates in his briefcase. On the way home, he loses the
          briefcase! A thief finds the briefcase and the stock certificate
          endorsed in blank. The thief takes the certificates to his stock
          broker and the stock broker has no reason to doubt his word that he
          bought the certificates from Smith. The broker sells the certificates
          through NYSE. The purchaser has 100% title to those certificates. How
          does bank B change its operations after this event? They will have
          Smith sign a separate piece of paper: a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">stock power</i> or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">assignment</i>. They will keep
          the two documents separate at all times.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >State statutes protect the company in paying dividends. They may rely
          upon their books of record unless they have actual knowledge to the
          contrary. But there are two exceptions to this rule: (1) upon final
          dissolution, to get your money from the company, you must present your
          actual certificate, which they will stamp �cancelled�, and keep it.
          (2) If it�s a series of payments in partial liquidation, you�ll have
          to present your certificate several times. This is certainly
          cumbersome, but the Internal Revenue Service loves it because they can
          trace who gets what in dividends and interest. Some companies have
          gone to a wholly electronic dividend payment system, but these are the
          small minority. Most use the old paper method.</span

          companies. The insurance departments have the power to go into state
          court and get receiverships and that�s the way insolvent insurance
          companies are handled. What happened here? It was a proxy fight! A big
          block of stock was held by an insolvent insurance corporation. On the
          books of the company where the proxy fight was taking place,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">of record</i>, all that was

            trial court, which is the court that appointed the receiver, had
            this issue come before it and it issued an order as to how the

      <p>
        <span
          >State statutes literally require the appointment of an important
          officer called the Inspector of Elections for each
          <span class="GramE">shareholders�</span> meeting. This person is
          important because if there is a close or disputed item, the inspector
          will conduct an administrative hearing, take evidence from lawyers for
          both sides, and then will issue his certificate. He�ll basically say,
          �Jones won� or �Smith won� and give his reasoning. In most states,
          that report is accepted in the courts prima facie. There is a
          presumption that they are correct. If it�s a close corporation and you
          don�t anticipate any dispute, they�ll usually pick one of the
          corporate officers and name him Inspector of Elections. If there is
          likely to be a dispute, they�ll hire one of the Big Four accounting
          firms. If you have issues that you want to work out up front (before
          the meeting) in court, in many states the only way to do so is through
          declaratory judgment. If you went for a mandatory injunction, they may
          say that you�re invading the responsibility of the Inspector of
          Elections. But if you ask for declaratory judgment, there may not be a
          problem.</span

          >On the back of the stock certificate in small print was a notice that
          transfer of a big block of stock probably would require prior approval
          of the NYSE. The person pledging the stock didn�t make his loan
          payment and the S &amp; L wanted to foreclose and sell the stock. But
          what�s the problem? The rules of the NYSE
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">did</i> somewhat prohibit the
          transfer, and those rules were not unreasonable restraints on
          alienation on a common law basis. The court holds that a
          straightforward interpretation of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial
          Code says that generally speaking, restrictions on transfer must be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">conspicuously </i>put on the
          face of the certificate (e.g. full caps or a different color with big
          type). Neither one was done here! The Uniform Commercial Code goes on
          to say that if it�s a bona fide mortgagee or purchaser for value
          without notice of this, that person will take free of the restriction.
          The court held that since the notice hadn�t been placed conspicuously
          on the face of the certificate, the trial court should determine
          whether the S &amp; L had actual knowledge of the restriction at the
          time that they made the loan.</span

          >This case talks about dissolution, which has two �flavors�: (1)
          voluntary and (2) involuntary. Voluntary dissolution is governed by �
          1701.86-.91, where the shareholders vote to dissolve the corporation.
          That vote will give the directors authority to sell the assets and
          .86-.91 will direct the directors (at their own peril!) to pay or make
          adequate provision for all creditors. Then the directors will
          distribute the cash left over to the shareholders. Once in a great
          while, it will be an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">in-kind� </i>dissolution of the
          corporation. If there�s only one shareholder, and they only own
          <span class="SpellE">Greenacre</span>, then the corporation can
          distribute <span class="SpellE">Greenacre</span> to the sole
          shareholder. That�s rare, because under the Internal Revenue Code ��
          331-338, if it�s a Sub C company, there will be a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">double tax</i>: one at the
          corporate level and one at the shareholder level. That�s why companies
          often use an LLC. The tax problems can be overcome if the sale is set
          up solely for the stock of another company: the whole thing can be
          tax-free!</span

        <span

        ><span>
          statute in the present case. So we�re looking at a particular way of
          involuntarily dissolving a corporation. Here�s an important legal
          point: all dissolution orders by courts are on the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">equity side</i> of the docket
          (as opposed to the

        ><span>
          statute that on its face was broad in the categories of deadlock and
          oppression. There were two directors: the sister and the brother who
          actually ran things. Was the sister an employee of the company? She
          was not. Her husband had been a 50% shareholder with her brother and
          when her husband died, he left his stock to her. Her husband had been
          an employee, but she isn�t. The company is solvent. It�s making plenty
          of money because the brother is a good businessman. This is sort of
          the opposite of the

            ><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Hatt</i></span

          case. The brother and sister don�t get along! There�s a deadlock! The
          board can�t do anything because a majority can never be mustered!
          There�s also a deadlock at the shareholders� level. If there is a
          deadlock at the shareholders� level, the directors stay in place until
          their replacements are elected and take office. This is different from
          the political arena! If the board deadlocks, the president keeps their
          ongoing powers! Recall

          In good times, the company gave each of the two families two

          elect a successor to Jones #2. If you have a four person board of

<p><span>Corporate
and partnership law draw heavily on agency law and the law of insurance. The <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Perl</i></span> case involves insurance in the context of a law
firm. We do quite a bit in this course
with law firms.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Respondeat
superior</span></i></b></p>

<br/>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Respondeat superior</span></i><span> – “Let the master answer.” What is this doctrine? If you have (1) a servant-agent, (2) acting
within the scope of employment, (3) who commits a tort, the actor is liable,
but, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in addition</i>, the master (the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i>) is liable even if the master
is without fault. That’s an agency
doctrine. The related tort doctrine says
that if the principal was negligent in hiring, training, or failing to fire the
agent, then you can sue the principal in tort. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Respondeat superior</i> is much
more worrisome.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
any organization of any size, there will be the agents doing the work at the
bottom, and in the middle and toward the top there will be several layers of
managing agents like foremen, plant superintendents, and finally the president
up at the top. Does respondeat superior
apply to those managing agents so as to make them, in addition to the principal
(the corporation) liable without fault? The
answer is no, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>but</i> under Rest.2d
Agency, followed by </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, here’s the deal as to the
managing agent: he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i>, without liability,
reasonably delegate, but his initial delegation must be reasonable and there
must be reasonable supervision thereafter. If he fails either one of these tests, he can be liable to the third
party.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Example:
You have a supervisor of bus drivers for a bus company. One of the bus drivers is negligent one day
and kills a baby. We know that the bus
driver is going to be liable in negligence, and we know the corporation is
going to be liable by respondeat superior even if the corporation wasn’t negligent
in hiring, training, or failing to fire the driver. The parents of the baby will bring a wrongful
death action. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Can they also recover
against the supervisor of bus drivers? Apply the formula from Rest.2d Agency. If the supervisor of the bus drivers was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>negligent</i> in delegating to the bus driver initially or negligent in
supervision (for example, if all the bus drivers colleagues suspected he was a
dangerous driver but the supervisor never found that out), then the third party
can also sue the supervising agent.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about going up the ladder from the supervisor? Compare this to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >Iraq</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> prison scandal: how far up
will it go? A supervisor of bus drivers
would be expected to have a heavy hands-on role in supervision and hiring. But it would be harder to reach the president
of a company that has 1,000 bus drivers. Maybe the president knew that this particular driver was a danger behind
the wheel and said: “Hell, what’s a little baby here or there.” That’s a plaintiff’s lawyer’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dream</i>!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Note
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Holy Trinity</i> of agency law: (1) P
– the principal, (2) A – the agent, and (3) TP – for the third party. It’s like a troika! They’re tied together.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Note
also that the supervisor of bus drivers in this hypothetical can be liable to
the corporation, that is, the supervisory agency can be liable to the corporation,
at least in theory. The bus driver who
runs over the baby is liable, and the bus company is liable under respondeat
superior.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
go over these rules carefully. With a
few exceptions, noted tomorrow, the principal found liable under respondeat
superior has a good cause of action in indemnification (that’s one way to look
at it) or in subrogation (another way) against the bus driver. Let’s stop and think about this: the
subrogation theory is probably the more obvious one. In paying off the parents of the deceased
baby, under duress (that is, a legal judgment) the principal becomes subrogated
to the baby’s rights against the bus driver. But there’s a big, important exception: if the principal has an
insurance policy covering both him and the agent, then the principal cannot go
against the agent because the insurance company is covering both of them and if
the insurance company went against the agent, the insurance company would have
to pay off what they won against the agent and there is a big legal principle
involved: where this is a pure <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>circuity</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> of action</i>,
the courts will not entertain the matter.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What’s
a pure <span class=SpellE>circuity</span> of action? If A sues B in court and A wins, B has, as a
matter of law, a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mirror-image cause of
action</i> against A in the same amount. But the courts won’t entertain it! Also, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Supreme Court has held that
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> is liable for the negligence
of one of its agents. The common law principle
allowing the principal to go against the agent <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>does not exist</i>. </span><st1:place><span
>Douglas</span></st1:place><span> says that the statute didn’t
give them this right! But this decision
could have gone just the other way. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, this is handled more by statute. By negligence, it will be the same
situation. If all you’re alleging is negligence,
you generally have to go against the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> alone, and you can’t join
the state employer. However, if you’re
alleging something worse than negligence, you can sue <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>both</i> the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and </i>the individual.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>caution</i>: you may have to bring one
action in the Court of Claims, and bring simultaneously the second one in the
Court of Common Pleas. Likewise, the Ohio
Supreme Court has held, generally speaking, that only the Ohio Court of Claims
can determine whether an employee was in the scope of employment. In addition, with both the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and Federal Courts of
Claims, they have no equity jurisdiction and no restitution jurisdiction. Only the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span
 >Federal District Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span> or the state court of
Common Pleas can sit in equity. Does
that mean that often when you sue the government you have to file two parallel
suits? Yes, it does!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Corporate securities</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Corporate
securities determine, among other things, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>who
controls</i> (that is, who elects directors), which in turn controls <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>who gets the good jobs</i> (since the
directors choose the officers), and also what cash flow will go to the
shareholders. That’s all the securities
we’ll handle right now.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
most junior equity (usually common stock) captures the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>upside</i>. Take <span
class=SpellE>Google</span> for example. The people who have big numbers of shares in <span class=SpellE>Google</span>
will make out like gangbusters! One
venture capital firm invested $12 million way back when, and after the IPO,
some say that their holdings will be worth $1.2 billion. That’s a 100000% return! It is invariably the common stock that elects
directors. Sometimes you’ll see voting
preferred stock, but not all that often. So let us call common stock the most junior.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>If a company sells its assets and is liquidated and it’s paying off its
security holders, who takes first?</span></span><span> <span
class=GramE>Creditors.</span> Second? <span class=GramE>Preferred
stockholders.</span> <span class=GramE>Third?</span> <span class=GramE>Common stockholders.</span> Those most junior stockholders will get <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nothing</i> unless the creditors and common
stockholders are satisfied in whole. On
the other hand, the holder of a fully secured mortgage note (the most senior
debt) is the most protected when the downside comes. If, for example, a bank lends $20 million and
takes first mortgages on a plant and inventory worth $25 million and then
bankruptcy is declared, the bank will come out okay because they are the most
protected. The unsecured creditors, that
is, the creditors with no lien, often take nothing or close to nothing in
bankruptcy. Why? The secured creditors may have placed first
mortgages on almost everything. What does
this have to do with us?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Say
you’re a supplier of industrial parts to midsize manufacturers. The manufacturer wants 200,000 industrial
parts on credit. We check the financial
statements of the company and see the first mortgages held by the bank. We’re a little worried: the sale on 90 days
credit to this company is worlds apart from Exxon, which is the most solvent
company in the world. (Why? Oil prices change a lot, so they are very,
very conservative.) The sales manager
and the president of our parts supplier will discuss the danger. We could choose not to sell. We could choose to sell, but mark up the
price 35%. What else can we do? If the president of that company is Mr. Jones
and he owns 60% of it, he must be deeply committed to the company. It’s his life! If he is well-off personally, then you can go
to Mr. Jones and, in advance, get a signed, written guarantee of payment from
him. That’s valid under the statute of
frauds because it’s in writing and it’s signed by the person to be
charged. There’s also consideration.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Guaranty and <span
class=SpellE>suretyship</span></span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>That
gets us into the law of guaranty and <span class=SpellE>suretyship</span>. Now, how do we research this stuff? There aren’t law school courses on this
anymore. Post-World War II, there is a
1949 hornbook by West entitled “Surety and Guaranty” by Simpson, one of the “grand
old men of contracts”. It’s very dated,
but it’s very good and it’s a good place to start. Post-1980, there is a Restatement in this
area. What’s the difference between
guaranty and <span class=SpellE>suretyship</span>? If it’s a guarantee arrangement, the person <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>making the guaranty</i> is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>secondarily liable</i>. He is making a guaranty of someone else who
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>primarily</i> liable. If the creditor doesn’t mess it up and the
primary creditor doesn’t pay (here, the manufacturing company), we, the
supplier of industrial parts, can go against Mr. Jones and get our money. But that’s not the end of the story. By the doctrine of subrogation, once Jones
pays the debt off, he can collect from his corporation because he is subrogated
to our rights. Maybe the company will
turn the corner and in a few years will be able to pay.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
are some fine points: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i> we have
already sold 600,000 units to this company on 90 day credit terms, for the
second 400,000 we’re going to force Mr. Jones to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>waive</i> his subrogation rights. Why? If the company goes
bankrupt, we don’t want him coming in and competing with us. The general principle here is that a
hard-nosed, sophisticated creditor will try to get the president to give up his
subrogation rights. How can the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>holder</i> of the guaranty screw up his
rights? If they extend the due date of
the company without the consent of Mr. Jones, they have waived their right to
go against Mr. Jones. This is heavy
stuff!!! It’s counterintuitive! But it’s true.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Another
fine point: if Jones is wealthy, how do they button this down 100%? They have him endorse and blank General
Motors stock certificates and give them to us as security for his liability. That’s allowed under the UCC. Then we get Merrill Lynch to guaranty his
signature. That’s because the stock
certificates will not move through the system without a broker-dealer involved
to prevent forgery.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
are surety bonds? By statute in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, if you’re doing
construction work for a public agency, the contractor has to go to </span><st1:place><span
>AETNA</span></st1:place><span> or some other approved
insurance company and get a surety bond written in favor of the state. This is not cheap! The premium can run from 3-8% depending on
the financial standing of the contractor. By statute, the state of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> cannot waive that. If you are getting a million dollar house
built, you will want to have the contractor get a surety bond in your
favor. Why? On surety, the writer of the bond has <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>primary</i> responsibility. But people sometimes pass up getting the
surety out of ignorance and because it’s hard to get insurance companies to
write these bonds. Keep in mind that if
the surety writer has to pay off, it is subrogated to the landowner’s right
against the contractor. But if the contractor
is a financial turnip, then it’s worthless.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
there more? Does it get more
complex? Yes, it does! Say Mr. Jones still owns 60%, and we’re still
the supplier of parts. Mr. Jones is a
good executive, but he doesn’t have much money. “God loves the poor or he wouldn’t have made so many of them.” – <span
class=GramE>to</span> paraphrase </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Lincoln</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. But business is business! You don’t succeed in business without being financially
hard-nosed. The only promise that
capitalism makes to you is that you have the right to file for bankruptcy. “It’s the worst form of economy except for
all others tried!” to paraphrase Churchill. But let’s say that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mrs.</i> Jones
is wealthy! Is it permissible to tell
Mr. Jones that we’re interested in his wife’s guaranty instead of his own? Sure! We can make that proposition. The
person who represents Mrs. Jones should tell her that she’ll have to pay. Her right to sue the company will be
subrogated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>At
closings, never bring in spouses, friends, and relatives. Creditors pass out guaranty forms for
everybody to sign. Sometimes you don’t
want to sign stuff! Also, keep spouses
and relatives off the board of directors and <span class=SpellE>officerships</span>
unless they’re <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>absolutely needed</i>. Under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, Mrs. Jones is not
going to be personally liable if her husband goes <span class=SpellE>bankrupty</span>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless</i> she guaranteed, she made him
her agent, entered into a partnership with him, or estoppel (she told creditors
not to worry; if he doesn’t pay, she’ll pay). Don’t let your clients say this stuff! Each person should stand on their own two feet.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cockerham</i></span>, the
husband had a lot of land before he got married. He married, acquired more land, and under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law what he acquired was
community property. The wife went to
town and started a dress shop as sole proprietor and also found another love interest. The dress shop is going to hell financially. Under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Cockerham’s</span> community land would have been liable to Mrs. <span
class=SpellE>Cockerham’s</span> dress store debts. But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>most</i>
of his land was acquired before the wedding and he would be able to keep
it. So the creditors get to Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Cockerham</span>. He should
have said: “She’s an independent entity. She’s not my agent. She’s not my partner.” But of course, this macho guy said: “Don’t
worry if her debts aren’t paid off by her! If they aren’t paid off by her, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I’ll</i>
pay them off!” Under principles of
estoppel, the court held that his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>separate</i>
farms, that is, the land that he owned when he got married, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as well as</i> his community property land was
available to the wife’s creditors. Mrs. <span
class=SpellE>Cockerham</span> is charged for wasting community property by
supporting her lover. In 1971, the
husband got custody of the kids! His big
mistake financially was “popping off”. He should have given the “NOW” speech: “I’m not half of anything. She’s not my agent, and she’s not my partner.” Then he should have turned around and walked
off.</span></p>

<p><span>We
continue to discuss the business corporation and choosing which business
associations you want. The tax
environment is crucial. Though this is
not a tax course, you have to know enough to ask the right questions.</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><span>Tax
consequences of different forms of corporations</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>From
1913-1960, the almost invariable rule where you had a corporation was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>double taxation</i>. That means: (1) the corporation itself is
subject to tax, and (2) when the income is paid over (the dividend), they are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>again </i>subject to tax, and (3) when the corporation
dissolves and distributes its assets to shareholders, there is a tax at the corporate
level on the difference between the fair market value of assets and what the
company paid for them <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> there is a
further tax at the shareholder level on the difference between what the
shareholder paid for the stock and the value that he received.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>An
old Republican joke: a lady in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Los Angeles</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> needed her lawn mowed. The PWA sent out four people. She says, “I know this is </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and we do things
differently in this state, but why four people to mow the lawn?” The foreman said: “One to come, one to go,
one to sleep, and one to mow.” The corporation
is subject to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>four way grab by the government</i>! Shipman says: “Horrible.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Mutual funds</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
first exception came in 1942 for mutual funds. What’s a mutual fund? It invests
in securities of companies. It sells its
own stock to shareholders and your investment is very liquid in the fund. If you need to redeem the shares, you can
redeem them for cash in just a few days. Note that they are always issuing new stock. Mutual funds have grown! There are over 8,000 registered mutual funds
in this country. The advisory <span
class=GramE>fees paid to the advisors of these funds is</span> $50 billion in
the aggregate. This is big business! Mutual funds are one of the most important of
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>institutional investors</i>. They’ve done awfully well in terms of tax
treatment. They must be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonably diversified</i>. In economics, we find that economics
recognizes that the ordinary prudent investor wants reasonable diversification:
they don’t want all their eggs in one basket.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=SpellE><b><span>REITs</span></b></span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the late 1950’s and early 1960’s, a similar deal was put in for Real Estate
Investment Trusts, or <span class=SpellE>REITs</span>. It’s an odd statute. It says that if you’re a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>trust</i> taxable as a corporation and you make the election, it is
similar to mutual funds. If you pay out
a certain percent of your income each year (something like 95%), then as to
what is paid out, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i> aren’t taxed on
it; only the recipient shareholders are taxed on it. <span class=SpellE>REITs</span> haven’t had
as great a run as mutual funds. Shipman
speculates that the promoters have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>benefited
themselves</i> more than shareholders.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Subchapters C and S</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>At
the same time, a huge amendment to the Internal Revenue Code, Subchapter C came
into being. This is the general
subchapter governing corporation. All
the rules in this section are double and triple taxation! If you meet the requirements and make the
election properly, you are governed mainly by Subchapter S. But where Subchapter S doesn’t deal with an
issue, you go back to Subchapter C. Sub
S is a bit different than the mutual fund situation. How many companies can elect? It must be a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> corporation. It can have no more than a certain number of shareholders
(75 as of the last edition of the book). No shareholder can be a partnership, corporation, or ordinary
trust. There are limits on the extent to
which non-resident aliens can own stock in the Sub S <span class=GramE>company</span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Making
and keeping this election is complicated! It requires a lawyer because what you have to have is a shareholders’
agreement under O.R.C. § 1701.591 to restrict the transfers of shares and
require election of consent by everybody who gets the shares. The board of directors files the consent with
the Internal Revenue Service, but they have to have consents from all shareholders. It’s a two-level proposition. If you’re only dealing with one or two shareholders,
it’s pretty simple, but if you’re dealing with 45, it’s going to get
complicated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the election is made, the situation is about 70% like that of a general
partnership. Tax lawyers describe this
as “flow-through taxation”. What does
that mean? It means that the corporation
files a return, but it’s an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>information return
</i>as to income taxes. As to taxes
other than income taxes, it’s fully subject, just like GM: excise taxes, sales
taxes, real estate taxes, corporate franchise taxes and so on. But they file a return, and then at the end
of the year they inform each shareholder of his or her share of the net income
or net loss for the year and the shareholders include it in their income just
like in a partnership (in a way). If the
company <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>keeps</i> all the income, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>it’s still taxable to the shareholders
currently</i>. That’s one of the reasons
why you must have a § 1701.591 agreement. You want to require, say, half of earnings to be paid out because the shareholders
have to pay state, city, and federal income taxes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Suppose
the company makes $1 million in year one, has one shareholder, and pays nothing
out. The company pays no tax, but the shareholder
is subject to tax on $1 million, absent a 591 agreement. If the shareholder is Bill Gates, it’s no
biggie since Gates is worth $50 billion. But for most people, it’s a big deal! Suppose that in year two, that money is paid out. That’s called PTI – <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>previously taxed income</i>. If
the company broke even in year two but gave a $1 million check to the guy, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>he wouldn’t pay any tax on that</i>, because
it would be previously taxed income. Most states now allow did. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> did not until about 20
years ago.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=SpellE><b><span>LLCs</span></b></span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> and Subchapter K</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let
us compare Sub S to the new kid on the block from Sub K-land: the LLC! First of all, you can have an LLC if you “check
the box”. You can have an LLC with Sub K
treatment even if a corporation, a trust, a partnership or a non-resident alien
is a member of the LLC! Furthermore, the
numbers can exceed the 75 specified shareholders in Sub S. Is there an upper limit? Yes…it comes in a “back-handed” way. Under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>current
tax law</i>, no new Sub K entity can have securities traded on a public
market. We will discover that two
sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, §§ 15(d) and 12(g)(1), will
cause (1) an entity that makes a registered public offering under the Act of
1933(?) or (2) any entity with 500 or more holders to file public periodic
reports with the SEC. With those
reports, under Rule 15c2-11 of the 1934 Act, a public market <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> be made by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>any</i> broker-dealer in the country on that stock. In addition, under §§ 12(a) and (b) of the
1934 Act, if you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>voluntarily</i> list any
security on a national securities exchange there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>per se</i> a public market in that security. Therefore, as a practical matter, you have to
work with a securities lawyer and avoid these four sections of the Act. It’s a back-handed limitation. Grandfathered in are a few old limited
partnerships from the 1980s that are listed on a couple of exchanges: these are
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>master limited partnerships</i>. They were cut off a few years ago, but there
are a few hanging around.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
we’ll get back to <span class=SpellE>LLCs</span> later. They are complicated but useful. <span class=SpellE>LLCs</span> have another
use: they are widely used for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mineral
interests </i>held by entrepreneurs, for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>real
estate</i> held by a real estate investor, and for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>intellectual property</i>. Why
are they so widely used? Two reasons:</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>Wealthy people, when they
die, will often leave property in trust to a bank to manage for their
family. They can also do this during
their lifetime. The big banks and trust
companies want investment property given to them to manage in trust to be in corporate
form or LLC form in order to minimize their potential liability. If you go to the bank and offer to transfer
to them, in trust, a general partnership interest, they will kick you out the
door! The opinion of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> lawyers is that the bank
could be liable for the debts of that general partnership that they’re acting
in trust for. If, on the other hand, you’re
a wealthy person and you want to put an LLC in trust for them to hold and
manage real estate, they are fairly well-shielded from liability (though not
completely). If the LLC goes bankrupt,
they’re unlikely to get stuck.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:37.5pt;text-indent:-19.5pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;
tab-stops:list 37.5pt'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><![endif]><span>In those three areas, with
those three assets, very often you’ll have two or more entrepreneurs come
together, each contributing some assets. At first, “it’s a torrid business love affair!” The entrepreneurs think they’re going to have
a great, successful business! But of
course, entrepreneurs usually have big egos. After a few years, each one often wants to pull their own contribution
out and go on their own merry way. If
you have a corporation, even a Sub S corporation, there will be a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tax </i>on “phantom income” at the corporation
level, measured by the difference between the cost of the assets and the current
fair market value. In other words, you
get <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hosed</i>! If you’re in a Sub K situation, however, and
you talk with a tax lawyer early and plan it right, then very often the split
will be tax free to the LLC <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> tax
free to the member taking back what he contributed. He’ll simply take over the <span
class=SpellE>LLC’s</span> basis and move forward.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span>But
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>caution</i>: don’t ever put publicly
traded securities in a Sub K entity. There’s a tax trap there! There
are three better ways to do this:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:37.5pt;text-indent:-19.5pt;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3;
tab-stops:list 37.5pt'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><![endif]><span>With publicly traded
securities, put it in a revocable trust. If you do it right, contributions to the trust and the unraveling of it
will be tax free.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:37.5pt;text-indent:-19.5pt;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3;
tab-stops:list 37.5pt'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><![endif]><span>The other option is a
managing agency account with a big bank. As the name implies, there’s no trust, there’s no entity, although the
stock will be in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>name</i> of the
bank, it is a simple managing agency account and there is no consequence in
setting it up, and you have the right to revoke it at any time and they will
register the stock in your name and return it to you.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:37.5pt;text-indent:-19.5pt;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3;
tab-stops:list 37.5pt'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><![endif]><span>Finally, the third way to go
is a street name account at a big brokerage house. They call it this because they’ll hold the
stock in the name of their own “nominees” (some of their senior
executives). That makes trading a lot
easier. If you need it back at any time,
they’ll deliver the securities to you. This is a little more dangerous than <span class=GramE>an</span>
managing agency account with a huge bank, but it’s possible that a senior brokerage
executive could take your money and run! They sued the brokerage house, and under respondeat superior, the
brokerage house did repay them.</span></p>

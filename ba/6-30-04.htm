<p><b><span>More on the dissolution of partnerships</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Accounting
is crucial. In <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cauble</i></span>, if the original agreement
had provided that the payout to the widow of the deceased partner would have
been in three or four equal annual installments that it also would have held
up. Sometimes the capital accounts are
huge and there is no way the remaining partners can have a check written
quickly for the capital account. In <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cauble</i></span>, because
of the way § 38 of the Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 reads, if the parties
had agreed up-front that the widow’s profit interest would have terminated at
her husband’s death and that there would have been no interest (or interest at
a non-usurious rate) that also would have held up.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Some finance overview</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the mid-1950’s, there were seven or eight dominant Wall Street securities
firms. At that time, they were all partnerships. Their capitalization (by today’s standards)
was amazingly small: only $25-30 million. It’s still small even when you adjust for inflation. The big firms now have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>billions</i> in capital. But
there were problems: they soon realized that now and again even the best run
brokerage goes broke. Also, among your partners,
you will have some with very large capital accounts, to the tune of several
million. How do you deal with the widows
of the partners as they die? If you did
nothing and went with the UPA, the widow will get her money in a few months,
just as it says in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cauble</i></span>. First, they switched to limited partnerships
and tried to talk the widows into transferring their capital accounts to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>limited partnership status </i>at a good
fixed rate (like 9%). Then they
discovered that they had to make the same deal with retired partners. These problems also crop up in close corporations. People fail to consider the possibility that
someone will die or retire.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Within
limits, you can specific when, how, and how much the payout will be upon
dissolution. But if the sections say
that something is <span class=GramE>a dissolution</span>, you can’t specific
that thing as a non-dissolving event. For
example, you can’t agree that death constitutes dissolution. It’s only half true that you can contract to
determine what dissolution is. You <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> specify that there will be events of
dissolution in addition to what the statute deals with.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
fiduciary duty override will sometimes conflict with literal contract or statutory
provisions and working out the conflict is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>
mechanical. The RUPA deletes the
provision that there is a fiduciary duty in formation. They still leave the fiduciary duty in
operation. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, about five years ago a statute
was passed saying that there is no fiduciary duty in formation, but there is a fiduciary
duty in operation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>GAAP
accounting is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>accrual</i>
accounting. If you sell something on
credit, you take in the income and you increase the capital account
immediately. In other words, you accrue
immediately. For tax purposes, any business
using an inventory must use the accrual method. What does the Internal Revenue Code provide as to professionals? For service professions, regardless of
income, you can use the cash method, that is, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>accounts receivable are neither an asset nor income until they are
collected</i>. The capital account will
not reflect unrealized receivables. If
you are on the accrual method, the capital account will reflect such
receivables. Independent CPAs will
certify statements on the cash method, but they will put legends on the
statements saying that a non-GAAP method is being used. The pure cash method is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i> a traditional GAAP method.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>All
lawyers and doctors use the cash method because, from a business standpoint, their
cash flow runs far behind the provision of services. This may not always have been true,
especially with doctors. They may have
taken cash at the time of service. For
other businesses, once you reach a certain size, you must use accrual
accounting. This is mainly a matter of
the political power of lawyers and doctors. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> passed a statute saying that, upon dissolution,
unless otherwise agreed, the amount paid out would be book value. There arises a case where a lawyer dies who
is a partner. The partnership agreement
is silent. Not only did they not use fair
market value, but they cut the guy’s widow out of his share of the unrealized
receivables <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>completely</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:place><b><i
 style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>Adams</span></i></b></st1:place><b><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> v. Jarvis</span></i></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
this case, we have a medical partnership on the cash method. The partnership agreement provided for what a
rightful or wrongful withdrawing partner would get: if the partner pulls out
five months into the year and has a one-fourth profit interest, then he will
get his pro-rata income for the year: 5/12 times ¼. He will also get what is in his capital
account <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at book value</i>. Thus, the <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cauble</i></span> result of fair market
value (and possibly some goodwill) is precluded. The problem is that they’re using the cash
method, and as of May 31<sup>st</sup>, there may be up to $500,000 coming in as
accounts receivable. The departing
partner could be forfeiting $125,000 by leaving early! On a very literal reading, this squares with the
first sentence of § 38. But we’re
nervous because all the parties are fiduciaries with each other, and the law
generally abhors forfeitures. All
dissolution and accounting proceedings are equity proceedings! The court says something that Shipman claims
is only half true: the partners defined this as <span class=GramE>a non</span>-dissolution
and that’s okay because § 38 allows you to do that. But the court is overreaching, according to
Shipman. If you read between the lines,
this case says that this penalty is good policy because it tends to make people
live up to their contracts. In a later
case in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, they make this point explicitly. The book indicates that the situation in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> is just the opposite. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> cases have held that any <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Adams v. Jarvis</i> clause works a partial
forfeiture of property and, as such, is per se against public policy.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Very
commonly, whenever a law partner rightfully withdraws, retires or dies, he will
get a pro-rata share of that year’s income, the amount in his capital account
computed by book value, but no goodwill. The capital account payoff is often over the course of several years. Why is it done this way? Under Internal Revenue Code, if the agreement
provides that no part of the continued profit participation is for goodwill,
then the recipient includes that payment in income. But the good news is that the other partners
get to deduct or exclude that payment. Subchapter K is the only part of the Internal Revenue Code where you can
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>buy out</i> a business with after-tax
income. You can’t do it any other
way. As to the return of the capital
account, if, for example, it goes to a widow, the payment will be tax-free
because taxes have already been paid.</span></p>

<p><span>There
is an old Court of Appeals of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> case from the 1940’s in the
corporate context involving the question of whether at-will employees, while on
the company payroll, may use company time and resources to entice clients away
after they leave. One of the big
mid-level ad agencies in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>New York City</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> was incorporated. It was started by the old man, who, at his
best, was superb. But he was getting older
and losing it. The top people under <span
class=GramE>him</span> who were all at-will employees, thought they had worked
out an arrangement by which they would purchase the old man’s stock and he
would retire. But there was a real business
problem here: at the last minute, the old man refused to sign. Without informing him or getting his consent,
they plotted a walkout day. They set up
a new shop on company time while drawing company paychecks and solicited
clients. They walked out, taking a lot
of clients with them. The old corporation
and the old man sued under agency and corporate law saying that these people
had violated their duty of loyalty, duty of care, and duty of full and fair
disclosure up-front to the company and the old man. The court answered that it was still the majority
rule in the corporate world that the at-will employees could not participate in
this type of activity.</span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Meehan v. <span
class=SpellE>Shaughnessy</span></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is an unusual partnership agreement in that it lumps rightful and wrongful
dissolution together and provides what is going to happen. The court looks at the agreement and
basically ratifies the agreement. It
sees no conflict between the agreement and the UPA. In this case, some of the partners went to
young associates and solicited business for their new firm. They held that the old per se rule of setting
up shop while being employed didn’t apply to a law firm because at a law firm
the main parties to be protected are the clients, and the clients can’t get
good service unless there is work up front. The court found a violation, holding that the old partners had a right
to have their solicitation sent to the clients at the same time that the
departing partners sent theirs. Note
that you can’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>forcibly</i> take clients
with you.</span></p>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>8182 Maryland
Associates, Limited Partnership v. Sheehan</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Kansas City</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> around 1984, we have a
fast-growing mid-sized law firm. One of
the lawyers did financial work. They saw
growth in the area and decided to sign a long term lease under the “last
erection” principle, which comes from the S &amp; L crisis of the early 1980’s. You could tell that an S &amp; L was going
out of business when they spent hundreds of millions to build new
skyscrapers. So the partnership signed a
long term lease. This was a general
partnership; the case shows the dangers of not using an LLC or corporation. Acceleration clauses in these documents, at
least in non-consumer leases, are fully valid. The <span class=SpellE>lessors</span> will hire good lawyers to put “good”
acceleration clauses in. What
happened? Legal business was great for a
while in the 1980’s, <span class=GramE>then</span> it turned sour in the late
1980’s for about four years. When that
lawyer left, what was the effect on the dissolution of the firm? The UPA tells us that the firm continues
until winding up occurs. In a contracts
sense, that will mean that all contracts that were on the books are paid
for. The court holds that the rising
star guy is liable! Don’t use general
partnership or LLP? Some states have the
broad form LLP that covers contract as well as torts, but most states have <span
class=SpellE>LLPs</span> that don’t cover contracts or embezzlement. An action for embezzlement can be pleaded as
tort or contract. The <span
class=SpellE>lessor</span> failed to ratify or adopt in this case.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
happens when there is a joint judgment against all those partners plus the partnership? In the case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Wayne Smith</i> from the Ohio Supreme Court, it is held that where
there is joint liability in contract, you must first try to get satisfaction at
the partnership level, meaning that your suit is both against the partnership
and all partners, because if you omit one partner you can’t go back later and
get ‘<span class=SpellE>em</span>. In
tort, you can move “sequentially”. Later, it was held that when you go to the two 50% partners, the
creditor should <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>try</i> to get 50% from
each, but if one is a turnip, then after trying to divide it 50-50, you can get
100% from the other. We’re into guaranty
and surety again. If you are a creditor
of a partnership and you let one partner off, some cases will hold that you
have released everyone. Furthermore, if
the partnership has to pay something by June 1<sup>st</sup> and you get that
date pass without suing them, then in many states the partner who has ditched
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>released</i> under surety and guaranty
law. If there are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>former</i> partners you want to reach, <span class=GramE>then</span>
before you extend the due date of the partnership, get all twelve partners to
consent. Otherwise, if you extend as to
the four that you will try to reach on surety grounds then you will screw up.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Along
the same lines, there was a big case from the 1960’s from the California Court
of Appeals dealing with tort liability. There was a general partnership for the practice of law. Smith was a general partner. While he was a partner, Jones, another partner,
brought a personal injury client in. Smith did not know about it. After he left, Jones mishandled the case and let the statute of
limitations run. The client sues the partnership,
current partners, and Smith, the retired partner. Smith says he wants out! He argues that the old firm was dissolved and
the negligence occurred after he left. The UPA tells us that the old firm continues until <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>winding up</i>, and for a tort client, that’s not until you’ve
completely finished a case, which may be 10-12 years later!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
do you protect yourself on torts if you’re a retiring partner? The firm today is usually an LLP. If you didn’t bring the client in and you
didn’t supervise or screw up, you’ll have a defense under the LLP statutes. The other thing that you do is in the
retirement agreement with the firm you get the firm to agree to have the
malpractice policy cover not only current partners and employees but former partners
and employees too. If the firm won’t do
it and it’s not an LLP, go buy yourself tail coverage. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, a limited partnership can
make an LLP election, in which case the general partner of the limited
partnership has some shield against tort liability, though it’s not worth a
lot. The job of the general partner of a
limited partnership is to supervise and manage. Don’t be an individual general partner of a limited partnership: form an
LLC or a corporation.</span></p>

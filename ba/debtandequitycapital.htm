          >You need money to run a business! This money is called capital. You
          can borrow it, you can get contributions from owners of the business,
          you can get money from outside investors or you can reinvest your
          business�s earnings back into the business to make it grow.</span

        <span
          >There�s a key difference between equity capital and debt. Debt is
          something that you borrow and pay interest on. You have to repay it
          eventually. Equity capital is an ownership interest that is valued by
          the market price of a piece of property minus the debts against that
          property. Some securities may be somewhat of a combination of both.
          Debt claims are also known as �fixed claims� and equity claims are
          also known as �residual claims�. This chapter focuses on raising
          capital through the sale of equity capital.</span

          >Don�t forget, when a business sells equity capital they are subject
          to lots of statutes like the Securities Exchange Act and state �blue
          sky laws�! So watch out!</span

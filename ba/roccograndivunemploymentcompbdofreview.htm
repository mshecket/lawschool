        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Three shareholders in a family corporation appealed a ruling saying
          that they couldn�t basically lay themselves off from their own company
          to collect unemployment checks because they were really self-employed
          and had the power to work or not work.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Can the corporate entity be ignored for the purposes of determining
          whether the claimants are statutory employees or if they are
          self-employed?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          The corporate entity may be ignored in determining whether the
          claimants are just self-employed people whose business wasn�t going so
          good at the time.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          Not much! It seems pretty tricky to vote on who will get laid off each
          time there isn�t enough work to go around. This court sees right
          through it.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The administrative rulings against the claimants are affirmed.</span

<p><span>Pretty
heavy stuff today!</span></p>

<p><b><span>Corporate statutes</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>To
summarize a lot of last week, state corporation statutes are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>enabling</i> statutes. They are designed to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>encourage investment</i>, following Locke’s idea of intelligently
adding labor to capital. The third part
of the triangle is entrepreneurs and managers. Other heavily regulatory state statutes like antitrust, securities,
environmental, and equal employment remain applicable. The state decided early on that corporations
should be subject to the heavy regulatory statutes. But you won’t find those in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>state</i> statutes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Nearly
all corporate statutes in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> are at the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>state level</i>. There are a few exceptions, and let’s see what
they are. If you wanted to form a bank,
you would have to decide whether to go to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and deal with the
Comptroller of the Currency or the Comptroller of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, or you could go to
downtown </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Columbus</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> and get an </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> charter. Shipman thinks that in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, you’re better off with a
state charter because their state statutes are more modern. The federal National Banking Act dates back
to the Civil War, and it’s awful to deal with, unless you’re forced to deal
with all the time.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Getting
an </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> charter doesn’t get you out of the federal
regulatory scheme. An Ohio bank will not
be chartered unless the bank first goes to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> to the FDIC (Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation). In most
states, this </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> practice is followed. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and a few other states,
there are some banks and savings and loans allowed to operate without federal
insurance. By the way, the FDIC insures
both banks and savings and loans.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you form a holding company for your Ohio bank (which you’ll always do, for
reasons to be cited later), you make a trip to another federal agency, the
Federal Reserve Bank. The Federal
Reserve Bank administers the Federal Bank Holding Act. They regulate the holding company, although
they may do much more. The next decision
to make with your Ohio bank is whether you want to have your bank join the
Federal Reserve System. It’s required
for all <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>national</i> banks, but it’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>optional</i> for state banks. The bigger state banks will join, but there
are some good mid-sized and small state banks that do not join because they don’t
think the benefits exceed the costs.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
a holding company? Holding companies and
non-bank subsidiaries can do things that the banks can’t do, and vice
versa. That’s one reason to form a
holding company. The second reason is
that banks, especially national banks, can’t use stock options to reward
executives, and options have become a big deal in the last 30 years. However, holding companies of banks <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> give out stock options. With S &amp; Ls, a similar but more
complicated decision is made. On the
federal level, the only type of S &amp; L that you can form is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mutual</i> savings and loan. What’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mutual</i>
S &amp; L, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mutual</i> bank, or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mutual </i>insurance company? They have no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>shareholders</i>. For an
insurance company, the policyholders own the company. For S &amp; Ls and banks, the depositors own
the company. So why have mutual
companies? Some of the biggest insurance
companies and S &amp; Ls are still mutual companies. The third-biggest S &amp; L in the country is
in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Chicago</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> and does well. Historically, the reason to have mutual companies was tax-related. Mutual companies used to be taxed much less
heavily than stock organizations, but that has changed over the last 50 or 60
years.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you form an S &amp; L under state law, it will be a stock S &amp; L, and it
will have to issue stock. Nearly all
states except for </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and one other will not
allow a stock S &amp; L to be formed without insurance from FDIC. There is also a Federal Savings and Loan
Holding Company Act administered by the Office of Thrift Supervision (“straight
out of ‘<span class=GramE>It’s</span> a Wonderful Life!’”). S &amp; Ls have about the same powers as
banks and are taxed in roughly the same way. It didn’t use to be so! S &amp;
Ls, especially <span class=SpellE>mutuals</span>, didn’t use to be taxed at
all! There are mutual banks, too. They have no stockholders, but rather, the
depositors own them. Also, some of the
biggest insurance companies in the country are still <span class=SpellE>mutuals</span>. The big insurance company in town is a
mixture. The parent company is a mutual
but owns a big chunk of a public stock subsidiary. Holding companies are used in insurance for
the same reason they’re used in banking. Insurance holding companies are regulated mostly by the states rather
than the federal government.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Through
antitrust, tax statutes, employment statutes, environmental statutes and many
others, Congress heavily regulates. But
the regulation of corporations is left to the states.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
is some terminology. To form a corporation,
you must fill out what are called “Articles of Incorporation”, signed by one or
more <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>incorporator</i>. You take that to the Secretary of State’s
office, pay a filing fee, and the process is started. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, that same document is
known as a “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Certificate</i> of Incorporation”. The generic name for both is “charter”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
about half the states, including some big ones like </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Illinois</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, some version of the
Revised Model Business Corporation Act is in effect. The casebook will give us some useful
information on the MBCA. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Hamilton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> was the reporter for the
Revised MBCA. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> or </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the Revised MBCA doesn’t
govern. So we’ll study these three sets
of statutes. We study </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statutes because about half
of the biggest corporations in the country are incorporated in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. About 60% of the case law in the country
comes out of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> “speaks with a loud voice”. We’ll also concentrate on the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> statute, found at O.R.C. §
1701. It’s a very good statute,
according to Shipman. He thinks if you’re
going to run a corporation in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, you would be nuts to incorporate
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Finally, we’ll
look at the Revised MBCA. The first MBCA
was put out in 1946. The revised version
came out in the 1990’s. The annotated
versions of the original and revised versions are a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>goldmine</i> for research. The
general Shipman rule is that unless there is a very good reason otherwise,
incorporate locally. The corporate
charter is a public document.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
is </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> so popular for incorporation? Part of it, Shipman says, is just tradition. The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> laws <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>used to be</i> pretty good. But
other states’ laws have gotten better, and there have been some screwy Delaware
Supreme Court decisions. But sometimes a
Delaware PIC will have good tax benefits. For example, The Limited has a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> holding company that holds
its intellectual property in a PIC.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> only, the rules of a corporation
are called the “regulations”. Everywhere
else, including </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the rules are called the corporate
“bylaws”. These are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i> a matter of public record, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless</i>
you’re a public company, in which case the bylaws will be on file with the SEC
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Bylaws can
be subpoenaed in litigation, though.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
general American rule is that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>internal
affairs </i>of a corporation are governed by the law of the state of incorporation. But what are “internal affairs”? That means the relationship between shareholders,
creditors, the corporation itself, the officers, directors, and the
promoters. If it doesn’t involve these
groups, then an affair is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-internal
affair</i>, and it will be governed according to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>common sense</i>. If you’re incorporated
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> but you set up a store in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Kentucky</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and hire workers in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Kentucky</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Kentucky</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> workers' compensation statute
will apply. Furthermore, if you make
money in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span>Kentucky</span></st1:City><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'>, </span><st1:State><span>Kentucky</span></st1:State></st1:place><span> will tax you on what you make. If one of your </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Kentucky</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> drivers “runs over a baby
in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Lexington</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>”, then </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Kentucky</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law will govern too. But if there’s a dispute between shareholders
and the corporation over the election of directors, then </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law will nearly always
governed. You can find this in
Restatement Second of Conflicts of Laws, which actually indicates that there
are a few exceptions to this. In
practice, we can say that the courts are not quite as consistent as the
Restatement indicates.</span></p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
common stock, so labeled, with Class B, which was labeled as common but de
facto preferred. Then there was stock
labeled as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>preferred</i>. The company, Axton-Fisher, was a mid-size, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>barely</i> public company. Its main business was tobacco. The company caught the attention of
Transamerica. Before 1956, when
Transamerica was forced to spin-off Bank of America, Transamerica owned both
insurance companies and the Bank of America in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. In World War II, tobacco and liquor were hard
to get domestically because they mostly went to the soldiers overseas. Axton-Fisher’s accounting statements carried the
inventory at “lower of cost or market”. That
meant that the value was understated on the financial statements. We looked at an example of consolidated
summary financial statements earlier in the course. Transamerica wanted to gain control of the
tobacco company and liquidate: an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in-kind</i>
liquidation. They would take the tobacco
and simply sell it and make out like gangbusters.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
court read the charter: the label preferred stock (Class A) could be called by
the corporation at a certain rate. The
Class B shares were a lot more complicated. Is the declaration and payment of dividends <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>mandatory</i>? In this case, the
answer was no. How do we know this? The dividends were “when, as, and if declared”,
and this was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-mandatory</i>
language. Can you have mandatory
preferred stock as to dividends, though? Generally, you can’t because the board of the directors and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only</i> the board <span class=GramE>determines</span>
whether dividends are paid (with certain exceptions to be developed
later). One exception is that when you
have a closely-held corporation where all the shareholders have signed a §
1701.591 agreement and the creditors aren’t hurt by the agreement, then that
agreement can provide for mandatory dividends.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
the dividend cumulative? <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>That is, if, in
a given year, the directors don’t declare dividends on preferred stock, do the
directors <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ultimately</i> have to pay
it? The footnotes of this case say that
the drafter made sure it was cumulative by saying: “if they don’t declare in a
year, they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shall accumulate</i>” and “if
any dividends <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>have</i> been passed, the
common stockholders can’t get a penny until any accumulated dividends are paid”. Is a preferred stock <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>participating</i>? Today, you
seldom see participating preferred stock. But this Class B stock <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is </i>participating. Once the board pays the annual dividend on
the Class B, the rest of what’s left is split between the Class B and the
common stock. Class B gets two bites at
the apple! How do you make a preferred <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-participating</i>? You use the phrase “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and no more</i>” after the words “dividend of $X, when, as, and if
declared by the board of directors”.</span></p>

language. The language is here: the
stock can be called at par plus accrued unpaid dividends. A call provision is always for the benefit of
the most <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>junior</i> security, that is,
common stock, because it puts a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cap</i>

stipulated formula (like fair market value, for example).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here,
it was callable and convertible. Securities are primarily a matter of contract law.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Court of Appeals held that because all of the directors of Axton-Fisher were
officers or directors of Transamerica, there was an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>overarching</i> conflict of interest, and the board of Axton-Fisher
could not call the preferred stock. The
district judge says to the Court of Appeals that they got it all wrong. The district judge says that the overriding
rule of law is that even if there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>complete
</i>conflict of interest, if the fiduciary shows overall fairness as to
disclosure up front and on the merits, and creditors are not injured, then
there is always a complete defense in the corporate world against conflict of
interest transactions (but in the trust world, this isn’t necessarily true).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Then
the district judge says that the call provision is for the benefit of the
common stock, and the conversion provision is for the benefit of the holders. T<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hen</i>,
this judge looks at Rule 10b-5 and says that to compute damages, let’s assume
the board of Axton-Fisher did it right, in which case they would have called
the Class B. However, if under Rule
10b-5 they should have informed the Class B holders of what was going on. The Class B, having been informed of that,
all would have converted. Therefore, the
judge says to the B holders that they should get 1:1, not 2:1. Shipman says that this is right! The terms of securities, including debt
securities, are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>everything</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>If
you have about the same disclosure duty under state law that you would have
under 10b-5, and the disclosure duty under state law is on a fiduciary basis,
then you plead the matter today under state law rather than under Rule
10b-5. How come? (1) 10b-5 always requires <span class=SpellE>scienter</span>. Under state law, if there is a heavy fiduciary
duty, mere negligence, without any <span class=SpellE>scienter</span> at all,
may well suffice. It’s easier to prove negligence
than fraud in either federal or state court. (2) In the 1990’s, there were three federal statutes that cut way back
on 10b-5 class actions. <span
class=GramE>More on these statutes later in the course.</span> These statutes are “plaintiff killing fields”. If you can avoid them, do so. They apply to class actions for fraud. Therefore, if you go under state law theories
that don’t require fraud to be proved, then you avoid them. (3) In the last 25 years, about half of the federal
judges have become more anti-plaintiff in the corporate area to some
degree. At the state level, it’s a more
even playing field. Even with class
action suits, often you stick with the simpler state law theories rather than
going to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> or to the federal courthouse. This is very pragmatic but true. This case is very important! Master this case!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
we have a promoter of a motel. The
economic word for “promoter” is entrepreneur. Promoter has a bit of a “bad touch” to it, so use the word “entrepreneur”. Entrepreneurs bring together labor, capital,
and management. They’re sort of like “matchmakers”!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
this case, the guy is a lawyer, but he thinks that the town needs a motel. So he buys land for about $200,000, probably
financed by a first mortgage with a local S &amp; L. He probably disclosed that he would transfer
the land to a corporation that would run the hotel. Today, he would have to negotiate with the S
&amp; L because usually it would put a “due upon sale” clause in the first mortgage
note, and unless they consent to the transaction, they could accelerate the
note and cause it to come due.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> a consumer transaction. There are no federal consumer statutes
involved. Everyone is a business, not a
consumer. The lawyer ups the value, in
his own mind, to $310,000. The lawyer
takes back roughly <span class=GramE>a</span> $110,000 second mortgage <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>note</i>, plus a second mortgage. In a mortgage, there are always <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>two instruments</i>. There is a note, which is the in personam
promise to pay of the maker, and there is the second <span class=SpellE>mortage</span>,
which is a real property interest that you record at the courthouse giving you
the right to foreclose if the principal and interest payments aren’t made. The two instruments are “tied together like
Mary and her little lamb”.</span></p>

<p><span><br>
<b>Notes</b></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A
note is a two-party debt instrument. There is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>maker </i>of the
note, who signs at the bottom, and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>payee</i>. A note is to be distinguished from a bill of
exchange which is a three-party debt instrument. With that instrument, there is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>maker</i>, a <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>drawee</i></span>, and a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>payee</i>. The <span class=SpellE>drawee</span> is the bank, the payee is the
person who you write in, and the maker is the signer. A note is two-party. There are all kinds of bills of exchange, but
we won’t get into them and we’ll stick with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>notes</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a rank real estate promotion, meaning that it is a very heavily leveraged
real estate corporation. This is the
opposite end of the world from the highly secure Exxon! A big danger for highly leveraged companies
is that they will go insolvent. How do
the courts deal with insolvent corporations? They do it in two ways:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>The insolvent person can
file a voluntary state court receivership or it can be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>involuntary</i> by creditors forcing the insolvent into the state court
receivership.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>The insolvent person, at the
front end, has the option of going under the Federal Bankruptcy Code of 1978,
found at 11 U.S.C., and they can file a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>voluntary</i>
petition of bankruptcy. Also, initially
the creditors could have filed an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>involuntary</i>
petition in bankruptcy, and a third possibility is that once a state court
receivership is filed, the creditors can force it to the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court. What’s the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court? It’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>unit of</i> the U.S. District Court. It has its own clerk and its own judges. It is reviewed by the U.S. District Court, and a district court judge
can take charge of a proceeding at the beginning if they’d like. Here, everyone was satisfied with a state
court receivership.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
creditor sign and file, on time, formal claims asking for a “piece of the pie”. It’s the same way in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> district court. To research this stuff, start out with the
Debtor-Creditor Nutshell, Shipman suggests.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
we’re in the state court receivership. The $110,000 note, which was originally payable to the promoter (the
lawyer), who was the 100% shareholder, had been <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>assigned</i> by him to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had filed a secured claim in the state court receivership. He says: “I have a good $110,000 face amount
claim, plus interest, as a secured creditor in this proceeding!” The court, acting <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sua</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> <span class=SpellE>sponte</span></i>, started this proceeding to
determine whether this guy had a valid claim.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
what does the court hold? First, a note,
if it is worded as “pay to X or pay to the order of X” will usually <span
class=GramE>be</span> a negotiable instrument under Uniform Commercial Code
Article III. But this note lacked this
language. It simply said: “pay to X”. The lawyer assigned it to his buddy for lots
of cash. The court holds that:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo4;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>The note is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not </i>a negotiable instrument under Article
III of the Uniform Commercial Code. If
it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were</i>, the holder of that note
could be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>holder in due course</i> and
have greater rights than his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>transferor</i>
had. It’s kind of like the Recording Acts
in Property. But since the words of
negotiability were missing, it was a simple, straightforward assignment and the
lawyer’s buddy stepped into the shoes of the lawyer. That is, every infirmity that the lawyer
suffered under, the buddy will also suffer under.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo4;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>Just what kind of infirmities
was the lawyer under? The lawyer was a
promoter, and he owed very high fiduciary duties to the corporation and to the
other shareholder.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.25in'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>When
he sells property to the corporation, in order for that to stand up, he must do
one of two things: (1) he must prove <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>overall
fairness</i> of disclosure and the substantive price and <span class=GramE>that
creditors</span> aren’t injured. Did the
assignee of the promoter prove that as to the promoter? No. (2) The promoter can only put people on the board of directors who are
independent, outside directors who are not beholden to him. If they approve, it will be tested under the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Business Judgment Rule</i>, a rule of
deference. That is, if they approve it,
it will stand <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless</i> the other party
shows fraud, arbitrary action, ultra <span class=SpellE>vires</span> (beyond
the powers), illegality, waste (meaning recklessness) and then the biggies: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gross</i> negligence in procedure, or gross negligence
on the merits. The last two are usually
the easiest to prove. Did the lawyer’s
assignee meet the Business Judgment Rule? No, because there wasn’t an independent Board of Directors. (3) If all shareholders and all present and
future creditors consent after full and fair disclosure up front, that would be
another “out”. Did the buddy qualify for
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> of these three “outs”? No! So
the infirmities of the lawyer carry over to him!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
you endorse an instrument to transfer, you have secondary liability unless you
write after that endorsement “without recourse”. The lawyer didn’t want that secondary liability! There are also certain warranties under Article
III whether it would be applicable or not. The lawyer probably wrote “W/R and without warranties”. What the lawyer did here was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>very dangerous</i>. The lawyer probably had a duty to tell the
purchaser that this was a non-negotiable note, subject to all the promoter’s
claims. Careful lawyers, when drafting a
non-negotiable note, will include the caption: “Non-negotiable note”. Why? There’s a case in the last thirty years that says that a lawyer who wasn’t
thinking about it but created a non-negotiable note was liable to a remote
purchaser who didn’t know it was a non-negotiable note. Are non-negotiable notes something you should
use at times? Sure they are! If you’re a manufacturer buying 300,000 parts
from someone, then if you give your non-negotiable note and the parts are
defective, then if they guy sues you on the note, you can set-off. It would be the same as if the guy sold the
note to a bank. But if you make the note
negotiable, then the note can be sold to a third party, like a bank. When the bank sues you on the note, you can’t
set-off the defective parts. Shipman
says that this is all a matter of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bargaining
power</i>.</span></p>

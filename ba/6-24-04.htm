          >A few final remarks on 10b-5: when a close corporation comes under
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Crosby v. Beam</i>, you need
          not rely on federal law. He believes that fraud is not required
          because the fiduciary duties are so intense. The absence of fraud is
          important because in the last 25 years, the federal courts have
          required extremely heightened pleading for fraud. Also, the 1995 Act
          reinforces the requirement as to fraud class actions concerning
          securities. If you can plead something lesser than fraud, do it,
          because it�s much easier to make out a case. In addition, if the
          defendant has insurance, remember that negligence and gross negligence
          will be covered by the policy, while hardcore fraud will not be
          covered.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >We�re leading up to a defense both to duty of care and duty of
          loyalty actions: the defense of special litigation committees,
          composed of truly independent outside directors studying the matter
          and concluding that it ought to be stopped. We also look at the
          defense on the merits of the shareholder decision not to sue. That
          will work under either duty of care or duty of loyalty. It requires
          that you can get disinterested shareholders holding a majority of the
          stock to vote with you after full and fair disclosure up-front. You
          also must show that creditors are not harmed. This is the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >non-unanimous shareholder ratification rule</i

        <span
          >Let�s say three siblings each hold 10% of the stock of a Sub C
          company. The father owns the remaining 70%. The three siblings are the
          directors and officers and they set their own pay. In the absence of a
          defense, if the father starts an action under
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Crosby v. Beam </i>or under
          Rule 23.1, the sibling�s only defense to the reasonableness of their
          compensation is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">overall reasonableness</i>.
          That is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">always</i> possible. If
          the defendants can show overall reasonableness, both in disclosure and
          on the <span class="GramE">merits,</span> and creditors aren�t harmed,
          then they have a defense. Note that this is a defense
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">on the merits</i>. A little
          company like this would not have outside directors who could set up a
          litigation committee. What would we advice the siblings? We would
          advise them to hold a joint shareholders� and directors� meeting and
          get all four people to vote �yes� for salaries. As long as there is
          full and fair disclosure up-front and no creditors are harmed, this is
          an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">absolute defense</i>.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Here is another defense lawyer�s trick. Defense lawyers have tried to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">bifurcate </i>or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">trifurcate </i>the trial. If
          you can convince the judge to do that up-front, then in the preceding
          example the defense can be asserted early. If the defendants win, they
          are home free because it�s a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">total</i> defense. This has
          recently been used in the 1990�s Supreme Court
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Exxon </i>case. The case came
          out of </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Hawaii</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >. Exxon had a huge tanker serviced under a contract with a dry-dock
          company. That company was negligent in servicing the Exxon ship, and
          as a result, the ship developed serious problems upon leaving the
          dock. The captain forgot to map where he was! Because the captain
          didn�t know where he was, the ship ran aground and caused a huge
          amount of damage.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Exxon sued the dry-dock company in negligence and in contract. The
          attorney for the dry-dock company convinced the judge to bifurcate,
          saying: �There is an overriding legal principle that if
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ordinary </i>negligence by the
          defendant is followed by
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">gross </i>negligence on the
          part of the plaintiff, then there is no
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">legal</i> cause, and thus the
          dry-dock company has a 100% defense.� The judge granted the motion and
          found that what the Exxon captain did was
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">gross</i> negligence, and under
          respondeat superior, Exxon is bound by the captain�s actions. He
          agreed with the defendant�s legal principle in negligence and he also
          said the same reasoning applied to the warranty count on the express
          written contract. Even if there is a warranty, the judge said, if the
          plaintiff reacts with gross negligence then the company has a 100%
          defense.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The U.S. Supreme Court held that the trial court judge was totally
          correct on the merits. What the defense lawyers did here is get to the
          �nub� of the matter quickly. Within each �half� of the case, they can
          use 12(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>6) and summary judgment. The
          court did not have to hear testimony about damages. They simply looked
          at one part of it.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >In the example above, what is done by the three siblings will not
          bind the Internal Revenue Service because it�s a Sub C company. If the
          Internal Revenue Service <span class="GramE">comes</span> calling, you
          will have to persuade them. However, the brothers are very much
          protected. One of the requirements is that creditors are not hurt.

          ><st1:place><span>New Jersey</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          company, had gone to the shareholders and gotten them to approve, in
          the bylaws, a cash bonus plan based on tables, that is, �if net profit
          is over <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">x</i>, then set aside
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">z</i>%� and so on. American
          Tobacco proved extremely profitable over the years and the cash
          bonuses went through the roof. A minority shareholder brought a
          shareholders� derivative action. There was no committee of
          independent, outside directors to pass on it, so it went to full
          trial. The case went in the federal court on diversity jurisdiction,

          under federal common law (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >Swift v. Tyson</i

          a disinterested majority of shareholders, and no injury to creditors,
          <span class="GramE">then</span> if it amounts to waste, it�s no good.
          Hill objected that the �money machine� can�t be turned off because the
          cash bonus plan was in the bylaws. The Court said that it was part of
          the duty of the directors to recommend an amendment to the
          shareholders that is contrary to the directors� interests. In </span

          than him. They didn�t get along well, and he decided to terminate the
          assistant. They came up with a termination package and it was put
          before the board for approval. Most of the board consisted of
          independent, outside directors. Before trial, the Delaware Supreme
          Court determined whether the pleadings were good enough. They said
          that waste is alleged. The case was sent back. There was also a case
          involving The Limited recently in the same court. The Limited is a big
          NYSE company, and there are a lot of social friends of Les

          company with several hundred shareholders. The directors and officers
          of Sinclair Venezuela were all directors, officers, or employees of
          Sinclair USA. Sinclair USA needed money. The directors of Sinclair
          Venezuela declared very good dividends over a number of years so that
          the parent corporation could replenish its bank account. Here we have
          a �man bites dog� lawsuit! It�s not a suit to force declaration of
          dividends, but rather a suit by the minority shareholders that the
          payment of these dividends hurt Sinclair Venezuela because they had
          business opportunities that they could have taken advantage of if not
          for the dividend policy. The threshold question was whether the case
          should be judged under conflict of interest analysis. If you do,
          Sinclair USA must prove overall reasonableness. On the other hand, is
          the case to be judged under the business judgment rule where the
          plaintiff, in order to stay in court, would have to show fraud, ultra
          vires, illegality, arbitrary action, or gross negligence to �shred the

          not governed by conflict of interest principles, and you must look at
          the business judgment rule! On the merits, they held that there is no
          reason to shred the business judgment shield. There were a few

          for something to invest in. The financial and operating folks figure
          that if they can get the other 49% of the subsidiary at the same price

          <span class="GramE">describe</span> the effect it
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">would</i> have had. The thrust
          of the rule is that if you have a public company with public
          shareholders having equity securities and through one or more
          transactions with an affiliate those public shareholders who
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">did</i> have equity securities

          securities then
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">the rule applies</i>. Note that
          if the rule had been in effect at the time, it would have applied. The
          rule says that, in addition to all other disclosure, the board of
          directors, in the proxy statement, must expressly state whether, in
          their opinion, the transaction is fair to minority shareholders. The
          board of directors must give detailed reasons for their conclusion.
          The Rule goes on to say that the directors cannot delegate this task
          to an investment banker, though they will hire an investment banker to
          help them. This is a high burden because the Rule goes on to state
          that projections, forward-looking information, appraisals, and �soft�
          data must be consulted. You must go way beyond GAAP!</span

          >The parent�s financial department had worked up tables indicating
          that the stock of the subsidiary would be worth about $22 or $23. They
          wanted to pay $19 which is what they paid before. The parent went
          through the books and records of the subsidiary without the consent of
          the board of directors of the subsidiary. They did their due diligence
          without the consent of the board. The information of the subsidiary
          belongs to the subsidiary, not the parent! They also did not set up an
          independent negotiating committee. They had three outside directors.
          The court says that they should have appointed an independent
          negotiating committee who would acquire independent counsel,
          investment bankers and CPAs and that if they had done all that, the
          business judgment rule would have saved the parent. There was no
          approval by a disinterested majority of shareholders, because a

          interest. You can revert to the more hospitable business judgment rule
          if you set up an independent negotiating committee at the subsidiary,
          but in this case the parent did not. There is no other defense
          available. Therefore, the parent has the burden of pleading and
          proving overall reasonableness. Overall reasonableness includes
          reasonableness on the merits as well as reasonableness of disclosure.
          The parent�s records showed that they believed the stock was worth
          $22-23. That was never disclosed to anyone at the subsidiary. The
          defense was not made out, and thus the case was remanded to determine
          damages. If you proceed under duty of loyalty, causation-in-fact can
          often go by the wayside. You also do not need to show fraud or bad
          faith if the plaintiff shows a serious conflict of interest. In that
          case, it is up to the

          strict anti-squeeze-out cases. But Shipman suggests that where there

          worked there full-time. The other guy owned slightly more than
          one-third, enough to block a merger. Business was rough, and the
          company was about to go under. The fellow running the company did some
          shopping around and found Z, Inc., which thinks they have a pretty
          good business. If the minority shareholder will agree to certain
          terms, Z, Inc. will swoop in and take over the business, continuing to
          employ the fellow running the company.</span

          that the salary he was receiving was reasonable. The salary being
          offered by Z is also stipulated to be reasonable. The minority
          shareholder decided to be difficult. The shareholder decided that he
          wanted a portion of the money the main guy gets or else he would use
          his power to block the deal. The guy running the company, with the
          consent of Z, Inc., set up a new company, N, Inc., and merged the old
          company into the new company with him getting stock and with the
          minority shareholder being cashed out. There was no fraud; everything
          was done on the up and up. There was a strong business purpose.
          Shipman believes that the deal was reasonable. The court says that
          where the person being frozen out has an appraisal remedy, if he waits
          until after the merger to sue, then he has no damage remedy (as long
          as there is no fraud).</span

          Hunt formed an LLC and got a ballot initiative for a half-percent
          sales tax to build an arena. The ballot initiative was killed partly

          Insurance. The head of Nationwide indicated that they would consider

          ultimately occurred. Hunt wasn�t thrilled with this change, and
          decided to block the transaction. McConnell and Wolff formed a new
          limited partnership and went ahead. Hunt sued on

          appraisal remedy at the end does
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not </i>toss him out of court.

          the closing several months in the future. If he couldn�t raise the
          money, he figured it would be the company on the line and not him. But
          his goal was to raise the money. He worked hard and succeeded. He

          The court�s reaction is to say that when it comes right down to it,
          the test is really just whether what the officer or controlling person
          did was reasonable. In the 1970�s, the ALI stepped into the fray. They

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Agency in the contract setting</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>We’ve looked at agency in the
tort setting; now we’ll look at three prototypical agency cases in the contract
setting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say you have X, Inc., and Ms.
Jones, president of the company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say Ms.
Jones enters into a large but not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extraordinary</i>
construction contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you get to
extraordinary items, you’ll have to have the approval of the board of directors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s why we presume the contract is not
extraordinary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The contract is in
writing and is described in the first paragraph as a contract between TP (Third
Party) and X, Inc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then at the signature
block at the bottom, we find it set up as follows: “X, INC., by: Jane Jones,
Pres.<span class=GramE>”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>TP</span> will
sign above.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jane Jones signs on the
dotted line.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means that Jones has
signed in her <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>corporate capacity</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If there is (1) actual
authority on the part of the agent, (2) the contract describes itself as a contract
between TP and X, Inc. and (3) the signature block reads properly (agency
capacity) then there is a valid contract between TP and X, Inc. and Jones has
no personal liability on such a contract, with the exception of fraud, in which
case TP may sue Jones and clearly sue X, Inc. for rescission and, in some
states, TP can sue X, Inc. for damages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If TP <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>wants</i> Jones to have
personal liability, there will have to be material below the line reading: “I,
Jane Jones, in my individual capacity, do hereby guarantee the performance and
payment of this contract.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then she’ll
sign again, just simply as “Jane Jones” with nothing under the signature.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is not present in our example here.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>actual </i>authority, the fact that the third party does not <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>believe</i> there is actual authority is
totally irrelevant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Usually the third
party <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>will</i> believe it, but if, in
fact, TP didn’t really believe it, it doesn’t matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Actual authority</span></b><span style='font-size:

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>It comes in two flavors: (1)
express and (2) implied.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Either flavor
suffices.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The difference between the two
goes back to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McCullough v. Maryland</i>
and Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion dealing with the Bank of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said: “Let
the end be legitimate and proper and all powers necessary to reach that end are
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied</i>.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a Constitutional Law principle.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Conceptually, actual authority results from manifestations
by the principal to the agent that she has such authority.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These manifestations can come in various
ways: (1) in the charter, (2) in the regulations, (3) in the resolutions of the
board of directors, or (4) if the principal has ratified similar transactions
by the agent in the past.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If you are dealing with a big
corporation that is heavy on paperwork, on a big transaction, supplies will
sometimes require a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purchase order</i> or
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>board of <span class=GramE>directors</span>
resolution</i> up front because they don’t want to get into <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>litigation</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The flip side is that if you are the third
party and you’re dealing with the president, and you submit the bill to the corporate
treasury for payment, the treasurer may ask the president where the purchase
order or board of <span class=GramE>directors</span> resolution can be
found.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is a practical matter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition, a sophisticated supplier not
under pressure in a big transaction will request the signed, written opinion of
the outside counsel to the corporation because this will get everyone in gear
to make sure the paperwork is clear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What about powers of attorney?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A power of attorney is a written instrument
creating agency.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You’ll have a serious
operation, for example, with a lot of bad medicine for six weeks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You would stop and fill out a power of attorney
to your spouse, parent, or close friend, sign it, and give it to them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Powers of attorney come in two flavors: (1)
general power of attorney, and (2) special power of attorney, which is more
limited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There is an old Third Circuit
case from the 1940’s called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Von <span
class=SpellE>Wedel</span></i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>New York City</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, there was a married couple where the wife was a </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> citizen and the husband had a Green Card but was a
German citizen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was 1940, 18 months
before the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>United
  States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>
entered the war.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The husband decided he
had to go back to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt'>Germany</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> and fight.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Before he left, he made out a power of attorney to his friend X with the
broadest possible general powers in it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>X can do anything that husband was allowed to do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>X thought the husband’s assets were about to
be seized by the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> government.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>X
uses the power of attorney to transfer all of the husband’s assets to the
wife.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The United States Department of
Justice challenged the transfer, and the Third Circuit found that gifts of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all assets</i> were so unusual that it could
not be done under even the most <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general</i>
power of attorney.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What should the
husband have done?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He should have
transferred the assets himself before he left, because that would have been <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unchallenged</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Today we deal with something
similar to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>special</i> power of attorney.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’re dealing with the actions of partners,
directors, or high officers of business associations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Take the facts of the example above, and let’s
say that in the articles of incorporation of X, Inc. is a provision that says “no
officer or employee shall cause a corporate contract to be entered into for
more than $5,000, unless the board of directors first authorizes.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let us say for the sake of argument that the contract
in question is for $50,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the past
three years, Jones, as president, on behalf of X with respect to everyone she’s
dealt with, she has signed contracts for $50,000 or $100,000 and the parties
have been paid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This shows <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>apparent</i> though not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>actual</i> authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Apparent authority<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Let’s say more specifically
that TP is unaware of the $5,000 limit in the articles of incorporation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The goods are delivered to X, Inc. and the invoice
is sent to the treasurer of X.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He gets a
nasty letter back with a certified copy of the provision of the articles of
incorporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under these facts, TP <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can </i>hold X to the contract because a
type of reliance has been proven by TP.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>TP has shown that it did not know of the restriction on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual </i>authority.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, apparent authority kicks in.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>X is liable on the contract, and has, in
theory, a cause of action against Jones for any damages they can prove.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The cause of action of X, Inc. against Jones
will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>disappear</i> if the board of
directors of X, Inc. expressly, implicitly, or by conduct ratifies or adopts
the contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This action will make it
as if there was actual authority from the beginning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if the board of directors does not
ratify, TP has a cause of action in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>restitution</i>
against X, Inc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There may also be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hardcore</i> estoppel, fraud, and so on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tricky thing is that TP has an action
against Jones for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>breach of the implied warranty</i>
or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied representation of authority</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>An agent signing impliedly represents or warrants
that he or she <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>has </i>authority (in some
states, this is watered down to “reasonably believes he or she has authority”).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>On the other hand, let’s
change the facts such that TP is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>aware</i>
of the $5,000 limit in the articles of incorporation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>TP went to the statehouse and read X’s
charter before dealing with Jane Jones.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
is no apparent authority in Jones in this case, because TP cannot make out an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>apparent </i>authority case if TP knows
there is no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual </i>authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Along the same lines of the
agent’s liability, under the UCC, if you sign a negotiable instrument as an
agent and you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do not bind</i> the
principal, under the UCC, you as agent have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>total</i>,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>automatic</i> liability.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, in about four states, if an
agent signs as an agent and doesn’t bind the principal, then it’s automatic
personal liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that’s a minority
view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If you’re dealing with federal,
state, or local government, the agent you’re dealing with must have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual </i><span class=GramE>authority,</span>
or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>none at all</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no such thing as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>apparent </i>authority when it comes to government.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Obviously, however, restitution may be
available against a government.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the government
commits fraud, you must check the Federal Tort Claims Act, which tends to
negate fraud.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It has numerous
exceptions, including acts by the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

hundreds of millions of dollars.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court
of Appeals sent it back for a new trial because they said the instructions were
insufficient.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Restitution is the <i

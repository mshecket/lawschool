          >We�ve looked at agency in the tort setting; now we�ll look at three
          prototypical agency cases in the contract setting. Say you have X,
          Inc., and Ms. Jones, president of the company. Say Ms. Jones enters
          into a large but not
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">extraordinary</i> construction
          contract. When you get to extraordinary items, you�ll have to have the
          approval of the board of directors. That�s why we presume the contract
          is not extraordinary. The contract is in writing and is described in
          the first paragraph as a contract between TP (Third Party) and X, Inc.
          Then at the signature block at the bottom, we find it set up as
          follows: �X, INC., by: Jane Jones, Pres.<span class="GramE"
            >� TP</span
          >
          will sign above. Jane Jones signs on the dotted line. That means that
          Jones has signed in her
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">corporate capacity</i>.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 14pt"
          >If there is (1) actual authority on the part of the agent, (2) the
          contract describes itself as a contract between TP and X, Inc. and (3)
          the signature block reads properly (agency capacity) then there is a
          valid contract between TP and X, Inc. and Jones has no personal
          liability on such a contract, with the exception of fraud, in which
          case TP may sue Jones and clearly sue X, Inc. for rescission and, in
          some states, TP can sue X, Inc. for damages. If TP
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">wants</i> Jones to have
          personal liability, there will have to be material below the line
          reading: �I, Jane Jones, in my individual capacity, do hereby
          guarantee the performance and payment of this contract.� Then she�ll
          sign again, just simply as �Jane Jones� with nothing under the
          signature. That is not present in our example here. If there is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">actual </i>authority, the fact
          that the third party does not
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">believe</i> there is actual
          authority is totally irrelevant. Usually the third party
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">will</i> believe it, but if, in
          fact, TP didn�t really believe it, it doesn�t matter.</span

          necessary to reach that end are
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">implied</i>.� That�s a
          Constitutional Law principle. Conceptually, actual authority results
          from manifestations by the principal to the agent that she has such
          authority. These manifestations can come in various ways: (1) in the
          charter, (2) in the regulations, (3) in the resolutions of the board
          of directors, or (4) if the principal has ratified similar
          transactions by the agent in the past.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">litigation</i>. The flip side
          is that if you are the third party and you�re dealing with the
          president, and you submit the bill to the corporate treasury for
          payment, the treasurer may ask the president where the purchase order
          or board of <span class="GramE">directors</span> resolution can be
          found. That is a practical matter. In addition, a sophisticated
          supplier not under pressure in a big transaction will request the
          signed, written opinion of the outside counsel to the corporation
          because this will get everyone in gear to make sure the paperwork is

          fill out a power of attorney to your spouse, parent, or close friend,
          sign it, and give it to them. Powers of attorney come in two flavors:

          We�re dealing with the actions of partners, directors, or high
          officers of business associations. Take the facts of the example
          above, and let�s say that in the articles of incorporation of X, Inc.
          is a provision that says �no officer or employee shall cause a
          corporate contract to be entered into for more than $5,000, unless the
          board of directors first authorizes.� Let us say for the sake of
          argument that the contract in question is for $50,000. In the past
          three years, Jones, as president, on behalf of X with respect to
          everyone she�s dealt with, she has signed contracts for $50,000 or
          $100,000 and the parties have been paid. This shows

          >Let�s say more specifically that TP is unaware of the $5,000 limit in
          the articles of incorporation. The goods are delivered to X, Inc. and
          the invoice is sent to the treasurer of X. He gets a nasty letter back
          with a certified copy of the provision of the articles of
          incorporation. Under these facts, TP
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">can </i>hold X to the contract
          because a type of reliance has been proven by TP. TP has shown that it
          did not know of the restriction on
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">actual </i>authority. Thus,
          apparent authority kicks in. X is liable on the contract, and has, in
          theory, a cause of action against Jones for any damages they can
          prove. The cause of action of X, Inc. against Jones will
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">disappear</i> if the board of
          directors of X, Inc. expressly, implicitly, or by conduct ratifies or
          adopts the contract. This action will make it as if there was actual
          authority from the beginning. But if the board of directors does not
          ratify, TP has a cause of action in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">restitution</i> against X, Inc.
          There may also be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">hardcore</i> estoppel, fraud,
          and so on. The tricky thing is that TP has an action against Jones for

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >implied representation of authority</i
          >. An agent signing impliedly represents or warrants that he or she

          X�s charter before dealing with Jane Jones. There is no apparent

          drafting of the plans. The board of directors did not formally act.
          The two people who negotiated with the architect did not own a

          what is known as an �upstream written guaranty� by S, Inc. of S�s
          liability to the bank. The corporate secretary for S, Inc. fills out a
          certificate and delivers it to the bank stating that S�s board of
          directors has duly met and has unanimously approved the S guaranty.
          Based on that, S�s president has signed the guaranty on behalf of S,
          Inc. Later, there is a bankruptcy and the bank files its claim both
          against P, Inc. and S, Inc. There are two touchy issues: (1)
          <span class="GramE">It</span> just so happened that the board of

          The case has a good discussion of apparent and actual authority. The
          court makes the point that if the board of directors ratifies similar
          <span class="GramE">transactions, that</span> can create
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">actual authority</i> in that

          Since the president owned most of the stock, in a number of states,
          they would go with the employee on the agency issue and it would help

        <b><span>Facts:</span></b
        ><span>
          Litton was the sole shareholder of Dixie Splint Coal Company. Pepper
          sued the company for royalties he was due on a lease. Before this case
          came up, Litton made the company confess a judgment, pay him claims
          for back salary, and then declare bankruptcy. The district court
          disallowed Litton�s claim, but the Court of Appeals reversed, saying
          that the previous judgment was res judicata.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Issue:</span></b
        ><span>
          Did the bankruptcy court have the power to disallow Litton�s judgment
          against the company of which he was the sole shareholder?</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Rule:</span></b
        ><span>
          Bankruptcy courts sit in equity and can set aside deals that don�t
          have the hallmarks of an �arms-length bargain�.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Analysis:</span></b
        ><span>
          Basically, the Court says that you can�t hide behind a one-man
          corporation to avoid being liable to creditors.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Conclusion:</span></b
        ><span>
          The Supreme Court reverses the Court of Appeals and reinstates the
          decision of the district court.</span

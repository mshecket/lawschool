          .03(Q), do so, because (O) is easier to satisfy.� � 1707.03(O) is
          limited to equity securities of a corporation or a limited liability
          company.� What�s an equity security?� It�s a stock, warrant, or debt
          convertible into stock.� What is the counterpart in </span
        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">Ohio</span
        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          to pure debt?� Look for the .02 regulations in a section dealing with
          commercial paper.� There are two sets of .02 regulations.� The first
          one, about 30 years old, says that despite the wording of the section,
          it is limited to debt sold to insiders/affiliates.� But in the 1990�s,
          the commissioner expanded .02, saying that if something is a pure debt
          security and if it would meet .03(O) if it were an equity security
          then it will meet <i>that particular regulation</i>.� Another set of </span

        ><span style="font-size: 14pt">
          regulations that are crucial are the regulations under .03(V).� There

          similar exemption for non-public companies up to a certain dollar
          limit.� The rules under 701-703T say that you need not integrate what
          you sell under these rules with Regulation D.� Regulation D makes the
          same statement.� Integration makes your hair go gray in this area!�
          Why is it restricted to non-public companies?� For non-public
          companies, the SEC has a short form, the S-8, for employee stock
          purchase plans and options.� It�s an easy form to use.� Later on we�ll
          see that employee stock options and purchase plans are a lot more
          valuable for public companies than for private companies.� Beginning
          25 years ago, executives could make tens of millions of dollars
          through these plans.� In the 1990�s, this expanded to up to $1
          billion.� Jack Welch has a net worth of around half a billion
          dollars.� So corporate executives can pull a lot of money!</span

          Shipman says this is subtle: if all purchasers are accredited
          investors, the test does not apply because if you read the rule
          carefully, there is a built-in, implied statement that accredited
          investors are <i>conclusively presumed</i> as a matter of law to be
          able to <i>fend for themselves</i>.� Is it true?� Maybe, maybe not.�
          If all purchasers are accredited investors, the issuer does
          <i>not</i> have to appoint a purchaser representative.� <i>But</i> if
          one or more purchasers is <i>not</i> an accredited investor, then this
          is the rule: if one of these purchasers is not a financial
          sophisticate, the issuer must hire, out of its own pocket, an
          independent investment banker aside from the one it uses to advise as
          to the suitability of the investment.</span

          in an offering, so defined, may not exceed 35.� If you sell 1,000
          shares to Mr. Jones and 1,000 shares to his wife, Ms. Smith, that

          have to help?� Each accredited investor counts as
          <i>zero</i> investors!� In other words, you could have 80 accredited
          investors plus 20 other people.� This counting rule ties in to 3(c)(1)
          of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which was the fifth federal
          securities statute passed.� If you�re an investment company, there is
          an <i>extra strong burdensome level of registration</i>.� The
          commission was aiming at mutual funds.� However, the definition of
          <i>investment company</i> is <i>much broader</i>.� Lawyers are
          concerned about <i>inadvertently</i> becoming an investment company.�
          But if you�re a bona fide commercial bank, you�re exempt.� If you�re a

          fide charitable trust, you�re exempt.� There is also an exemption for
          a company that invests in real estate mortgage notes.� In </span

        ><span style="font-size: 14pt"
          >, you may have to file as a <i>bond investment company</i>.� The big
          exemption from this Act is 3(c)(1).� This section says that if a
          company has fewer than 100 holders and it�s not presently making a
          <i>public </i>offering, then it�s exempt.� Therefore, if you set up a
          partnership that has mainly financial instruments in it, and there are
          only 80 partners then if you�re not presently making a public
          offering, you�ll be exempt.� This directly ties in with Rule 506
          because a 506 offering is <i>not </i>a public offering even if there

          of the various states were <i>contradictory</i>; you couldn�t please
          everyone. �So there is a lot of political dispersion.� As a reaction,
          a part of NSMIA provides as follows: this applies only as to Rule 506
          offerings, and not to � 4(2).� Rule 506 is <i>much</i> safer than �
          4(2)!� Rule 504 is safer still!� In </span

          filing, (2) a filing fee, (3) application of broker-dealer rules, (4)
          application of fraud law, and (5) application of criminal law.�
          <i>But </i>the states shall not, as a matter of routine, question the

          powers to impose substantive fairness tests.� This has worked, and
          though Shipman is in favor of state regulation, he thought state
          variation had gotten out of hand.� Another part of NSMIA dealt with
          broker-dealer rules. �It said that a federally registered
          broker-dealer can continue to be forced to register under state law.�
          There can be filing fees.� Criminal, fraud and injunctive provisions
          can be used.� <i>But</i> in applying selling practice and other rules,

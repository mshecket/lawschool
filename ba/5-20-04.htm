<p><span>Here
is some background information.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Not-for-profit corporations</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Yesterday,
we talked about the NYSE, organized as a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> not-for-profit corporation. All not-for-profit corporations have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>members</i> who elect <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>directors</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>trustees</i>. They don’t have shareholders, but they do
have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>creditors</i>. There are two big subdivisions of
not-for-profit corporations:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>Charitable, religious,
educational and corporations for the prevention of cruelty to animals – The
most favored not-for-profits are those that meet Internal Revenue Code § 501(c)(3). To gain this status, you must file papers
with the IRS in advance to convince them that you’re charitable. One requirement is that no insider can have
an undue right to the income or assets of the foundation. In practice, that means that the promoter can
be a trustee, director, or president and can collect a reasonable salary and
benefits, including a reasonable salary plan. Some people who run charitable corporations get good money! If you are a charitable organization, you’re
governed by ordinary state corporation law and also the law of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charitable trusts</i>. If you’re a § 1702 charitable corporation,
you’ll be governed by both § 1702 and § 1701 (to the extent that it’s not
inconsistent), and also by the law of charitable trusts. If you’re going to start a charitable
organization, though, do it under § 1702. If you get into a dispute over trust law, you’ll have to go to a
treatise.<br>
<br>
Under § 503(c)(3), you’re exempt from federal income taxation. You’re also exempt from most federal excise
taxes. You can also get an exemption
from real property taxes! But that’s not
the end of the financial feast! Under
IRC § 170, within certain percentage limits, donors making donations to you get
a federal income tax deduction.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>Non-charitable
not-for-profits – § 503(c)(6) describes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>business
leagues</i>, which provide <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i> tax
breaks, but not nearly as many as if you are a § 501(c)(3).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
NYSE approved a termination amount of $150 million! Many people are annoyed because the NYSE has
net income of only $25-30 million in a good year. The Attorney General of New York is
threatening to sue, which he can do if he can show that the directors were
reckless is setting this amount. If he
succeeds, that money can be recaptured. So Grasso and Spitzer are hissing at each other almost every day!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Family law</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Very
often, in dealing with business associations, family law comes up in a big way,
especially in the areas of property and divorce. In a common law jurisdiction, like </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and 40 other states, they
will start by breaking up the property held in each person’s name, and then
they will determine whether it is separate property or marital property. Separate property is property that either
person brought into the marriage or received by gift, devise, or intestate
succession. Other property that is held
in a spouse’s name, especially personal earnings, is marital property. Upon divorce in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and other states, marital property
will tend to get split 50-50. The
divorce action in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> consists of two subparts: dissolution
and divorce. Judges prefer dissolution.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Upon
death, in most common law states, the surviving spouse can get a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>forced share</i> of the other spouse’s property. It will range from 1/3 to ½. Study each state’s statutes carefully. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, if there is no prenupital
agreement, then the forced share applies to both separate <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and</i> marital property. If a
rich lady marries a poor man, and she dies but excludes him from her will, the
poor guy can retain a lawyer and get 1/3 of everything she had. That’s why prenuptial agreements are often
used! In many states, these agreements
not only have to be signed, but also <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>acknowledged</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>recorded</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Suppose
the rich lady marries the poor guy and there’s no prenuptial agreement and that
contrary to actuarial predictions, the poor young guy dies well before the rich
old lady. Is there any claim by the
heirs of the poor young guy? No, because
in the common law system, we say that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>potential</i>
interest of the other spouse that would rise to fruition if he outlives her is
an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inchoate expectancy</i>. Thus, if that spouse dies earlier, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nothing</i> of the wife’s property passes
under his will.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Consider
the “Cat in the Hatt” situation. Suppose
there had been no prenuptial agreement. What rights in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>management</i> of
the company would Hatt have had? If we’re
in a common law jurisdiction without a prenuptial agreement, and the property was
titled in her name then he would have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no</i>
management rights. But what if she took
dividends from her funeral home business to start a new funeral home company,
taking title in her own name? That would
be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>marital</i> property in most jurisdictions. But, since it’s titled in her name and it
doesn’t involve land, she would have the sole management power over that new business.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
about some really tough hypos? Let’s say
they they’re in a state with a heavy <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>homestead</i>
statute. She takes her money and buys a
homestead in her own name. She then
wants to contribute this homestead to a third corporation where she will own
all of the stock. How many signatures
are needed on the deed of the property in her name to the corporation? In most states, having homestead statutes,
community property or common law, there will need to be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>two</i> signatures.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Suppose
the lady takes money and buys a farm that is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i> a homestead, and after a few years she wants to form a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fourth</i> corporation, contributing the
land. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, where the homestead statute
exists but is rather limited, how many signatures are needed? In about six states, including </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>dower </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>curtesy </i>statutes
kick in, and we need two signatures. Know these hypos! If you screw
them up, it’s sure to be malpractice!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the lady owns stock in a company in a common law state and the stock is in her
own name, and she’s the only shareholder, how many signatures do you need on
the Sub S consent form? You only need
one, because if she’s in a common law jurisdiction and the corporation is
titled in her name, whether it’s separate or marital, she has the sole
management power and you only need one signature because dower and curtsey are
not involved, and stock in a corporation is not a homestead (with one
exception)!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Husband
and wife may own things jointly as tenants in common or tenants with right of
survivorship or tenants by the entireties in some states. Don’t forget the “Dos Signatures” rule! Today, more and more married couples hold
everything in joint names like this.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Community property</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Nine
states are community property states. They vary greatly between each other. There has been a rash of new statutes and court decisions in the last
thirty years. In a community property
state, they divide between separate property and “community” or “marital” property. Let’s say Hatt and the lady had their funeral
home in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> instead of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Indiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and there’s no prenuptial
agreement. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and all other community property
states, all personal earnings are always per se community property regardless
of how the title is taken. Also, in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Idaho</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, earnings from <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>separate </i>property are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>community</i> property. In the rest of the community property states,
if you don’t co-mingle and you have several different bank and brokerage
accounts, then <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>separate property</i>
stays <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>separate</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
say there is income from the funeral home, plus dividends from lots of GM
stock. The lady leaves her money to
charity. Here, the less rich spouse dies
before the more wealthy one. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the poor guy could get
half of the community property. In a
community property system, it’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> a
mere inchoate expectancy, it’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>vested
right</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
does this have to do with business associations? When you get to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>management</i> of community property assets, “that is a goddamn mess”. There are a couple of easy hypos. In many community property states you can
hold community property in joint tenancy. If there are two names on the property, you’ll need two signatures to
transfer. If there is a homestead in a
community property state, note that you’ll almost always need two signatures to
transfer it.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Do
community property states have dower and curtesy? Yes and no. Mainly no, though. But in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, if a common law couple
moves into those states from another state, then by statute their common law property
is still governed by the law of their original state and you could still need
two signatures.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
the big question: Sub S requires not only the board of directors making the
election but also the consent of all shareholders. The regulations used to say, and still say,
that in a community property state, regardless of how property is titled, it
will take the signature of both spouses in order for the election to be
valid. The management theory in the
community property states “is all fouled up”! In these states, if a company is started up in a husband’s name, the attorney
must assure that the wife writes down that she doesn’t object to the
transfer. They will add a paragraph that
says: “My husband is not my partner or my agent and I’m not liable for his
debts.” Always watch out for tax
elections in community property states!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you sue a husband on a community property debt, you must join the wife to get
at her share of the community property. Also, for an </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Arizona</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> partnership to agree to an arbitration
clause, even though the agreement is in the husband’s name, you must get a
signoff from the wife. So community property
law is pretty wild!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
a few states, if the husband has been married before and gets divorced, picks
up a new wife, and the new wife is a big moneymaker, then in a number of
states, the alimony payments and child-support payments due to the former wife
and kids of the first marriage can be taken out of the wife’s personal property
even if she doesn’t co-mingle. This
wouldn’t happen in a common law state though. In a lot of those states, the part of the community that the wife
manages (that is, her personal earnings) can be liable to the contracts and the
torts of the husband! It’s wild!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
someone is practicing law as a sole proprietor and you’re going to enter into a
five-year computer lease with him, you will want a signed statement from the
proprietor’s wife that says her part of the community property stands behind
the husband’s debt before you ink the transaction. How does she protect herself? She goes to an attorney, who tells the
husband to form an LLC or one-man corporation.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Equitable subordination – <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a href="peppervlitton.htm">Pepper v. Litton</a></i></span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
we have a closely held corporation. The
owner had not taken his salary out. A
creditor sues. Then all of the sudden,
the owner puts a lien on the assets of his company. The outside creditors went into state court
and challenged this on the ground of common law fraud with scienter. The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> courts said that these were
valid claims that he should have paid off as he earned them, but they were
valid nonetheless. The creditor filed an
involuntary petition in bankruptcy. The
major shareholder timely filed a secured claim and showed the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> court action to back it up.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Justice
Douglas holds that bankruptcy courts are always <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>courts of equity</i>. Furthermore, a claim can be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equitably</i>
subordinated if there are strong equitable grounds for doing so. The outside creditor in this case <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>did</i> show such strong equitable
grounds. Even though there was
purportedly a preclusion issue from the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> court decision, </span><st1:place><span
>Douglas</span></st1:place><span> held that the bankruptcy
courts recognize claim and issue preclusion, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>but</i> because bankruptcy proceedings are unique and policy-oriented,
then the bankruptcy courts can deviate from normal preclusion jurisprudence if
there’s a really good reason. This was a
case where it was okay to deviate! Therefore, they pushed the secured claim of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>insider </i>below all creditors, including unsecured creditors who were
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>outsiders</i>. This is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equitable
subordination</i>: you push a claim down one or more levels on the pecking
order. Any court of equity has the power
to do this! A state court receiver has
the same power.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Contractual subordination</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
result is a bit different than the result in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="peppervlitton.htm">Pepper</a></i>. Say you have a mid-sized public company that
needs to raise more money. They have
already borrowed a lot of money from a big insurance company and the loan
agreement requires the insurance company’s consent to any <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>new</i> debt. The public company
goes to the insurance company, and the insurance company says that they may
issue new debts to outsiders, but only if it is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>contractually subordinated </i>to the insurance company.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
mid-sized public company will issue debentures (unsecured debt) to the public,
with the following clause: “This debt is contractually subordinated to the debt
of Insurance Company. In any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, we authorize
Insurance Company to file a claim on their own behalf for their own debt and to
file, as our agent, a claim for this subordinated debt. If the total of those claims yields Insurance
Company less than the face amount of the debt to Insurance Company plus
interest, then Insurance Company keeps everything. If the total of the two claims filed by
Insurance Company yields more than the principal and interest of Insurance
Company’s debt, then the excess will be returned to us. These paragraphs create an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agency</i> and we hereby declare that the
agency is irrevocable as an agency coupled with an interest.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Contractual
subordination is, in effect, an assignment coupled with an agency coupled with
an interest declared to be irrevocable. Why that wording? The typical
agency power is revocable even if the revocation would cause the party revoking
to be liable in damages (which is counter-intuitive but correct). The big exception is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>an agency coupled with an interest</i>. Do you make an agency coupled with an interest merely by stating that it’s
coupled with an interest? No. The Restatement Second of Agency says that
the agent’s interest in performing services for a principal doesn’t make it an
agency coupled with an interest. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>But</i>, if the agent advances substantial
money or property, and the parties state that, then the agency is irrevocable. In our example above, the drafter “gilds the
lily” to show intent.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
are two examples: Joe Jones enters a
two-year contract with Mr. Smith who is a sole proprietor of a café. The agreement provides that Jones is to act
as general manager of the café for two years. Can the parties validly add to that contract the provision that it is an
agency coupled with an interest and thus irrevocable? No, because the agent’s mere interest in
providing services according to a contract <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ain’t
enough</i>. So let’s say after a year
Smith called in Jones and says: “Your agency powers are over and you’re fired.” And the agency really is over! Jones can sue if his firing violated an employment
discrimination statute.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>On
the other hand, change the facts. Let’s
say the business is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and the agent agrees to
advance a $100,000 loan to the principal, agreeing further that in light of the
agent’s advancing the money, the agency is declared to be coupled with an interest
and thus irrevocable. With this changed hypo,
the result would be different. The
agency power could not be terminated because the agent could give no
cause. If the agent is dipping into the till,
then the agency can be terminated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Subordinated
debt is widespread. If the subordination
goes only to payment of principal, it won’t screw up the tax deduction of a corporate
payor. But if interest payments are also
subordinated, you’re dead. If the
subordination goes to all creditors and not just institutional lenders, then I
think you’re dead too.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
you’re advising a controlling shareholder or a relative of a controlling shareholder,
you must tell them that in an insolvency proceeding you’ll probably get
equitably subordinated. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, O.R.C. §§ 1336.56-59 constitute
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraudulent preference</i> statute. We also have a form of the UFTA (Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act). Insiders and
relatives and affiliates of insiders will usually get <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>pushed down</i>. Sarbanes-Oxley
says that as to a public company, if there is “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>misconduct</i>” by an officer or director of a public company
concerning the company, bonus and incentive plan payments during the period of
the misconduct can be recaptured by the company. The law also says that if you get a judgment
against you for securities fraud, state homestead statutes will not exempt your
homestead. They’re aiming at </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, where you may have a lot
of acres plus a home of any value. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, you have an urban
homestead that no one can touch. Sarbanes-Oxley says that if you have securities fraud with a public
company, the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Texas</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and other homestead statutes
go away and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you lose</i> your homestead.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Insiders
have other problems. The first two cases
talk about the corporate veil. The corporate
veil can be disregarded for fraud and some other reasons. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="dewitttruckbrokersvwrayflemmingfruitco.htm">DeWitt</a></i>, Flemming made
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cockerham</i> mistake! He did the “macho” thing and promised to
stand by his corporation. He said, “If
the corporation doesn’t pay you, I will.”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><a
href="debaunvfirstwesternbankandtrustco.htm">Debaun</a></i>, it is held that majority
shareholders owe duties to the corporation. The bank sold their majority stake to a madman! The judge allows the derivative action
because he wanted the money to be put into the company so that the creditor
would get paid. The attorney for the minority
shareholders could get a reasonable attorney’s fee. The controlling shareholders owe <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>heavy duties</i>. For starters, remember <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><a href="peppervlitton.htm">Pepper</a></i>. Even if they lend money to the company, if it
goes bankrupt, they’re probably going to get pushed down the pile.</span></p>

          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          statutory scheme is common. The usual rule is a minimum of three
          directors. However, if you have only one shareholder, you have only
          one directors, and if you have only two shareholders then you can get
          by with only two directors. Also, if � 1701.591 is invoked, you could
          have a company with 20 shareholders and only one or two directors. But
          there is no <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">upper limit </i>to

        <span
          >Is there a minimum number of shareholders? Up to 1950, there were
          court decisions that followed the European practice that since the
          state statutes required a minimum of three directors, you had to have
          a minimum of three shareholders. Statutes in the 1960�s reversed this,
          and in the </span

          today, a single shareholder corporation is perfectly legal. The
          smaller the number of shareholders, the more likely the corporate veil
          will get pierced.</span

          >: (1) In many countries, there must be a minimum of three
          shareholders. In those countries, if there is an American parent that
          is the only shareholder, then you get two locals to buy one share
          each, and they will known as accommodation shareholders. The parent
          will have the option to buy back these shares. Watch foreign statutes
          carefully! (2) Even in </span

          different classes of corporations. One of the four will essentially be
          a hybrid between a corporation and a partnership. One of the hybrid
          features will be that the shareholders have joint and several
          liabilities. So be careful! In this country, for professional
          corporations in some states, they say that doctors may incorporate,
          but they will have the same liabilities as a partnership. For example,

          worldwide people will know what you�re talking about. Some state
          statutes authorize the use of �(comma) Ltd.� Don�t fool with it
          because it�s not exactly clear. It could also mean �limited
          partnership�. You have to hold yourself out as a corporation in every
          way if you want to be treated like a corporation.</span

          usually not tiny, but not high either. Look at the schedule of fees to
          determine how many shares you want. Don�t form a corporation with 100
          or 500 shares because they�re ultimately going to be spread around a
          family. If there are too few shares, you may have to set up a trust to
          subdivide one share!</span

          higher of the two. The franchise tax is a percentage applied against
          the assets of the company. If low par stock is used, and generally
          that will be either $0.01 or $0.0001 per share, then they will use the
          par value to determine the tax. But if there is no par, they will use
          the fair market value of the stock instead! Check if the state has a
          separate stock issuance or stock transfer tax. </span

          be avoided by holding the closing of a transaction in another state.
          For example, there are </span

          The Secretary of State can give you, for a fee, not only a certified
          copy of the articles of incorporation, you can also get a certified
          copy of the docket sheet for the corporation running back to
          formation. Plus, you can get certified copies of everything that�s
          there. The Secretary of State, also for a fee, will give you a
          certificate of good standing. What does this indicate? All state
          statutes provide that if you don�t make the required filings annually
          with the Secretary of State and/or your state tax returns, then they
          can <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">cancel</i> your
          corporation. The certificate of good standing says that a particular
          corporation is in good standing with the state. If you�re going to
          make a big deal, you always send someone to the Secretary of State�s
          office to get that. Also, you will have to get an attorney�s opinion
          that the corporation is duly and validly organized and existing as a
          corporation under </span

          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State

        <span
          >In many states, you can get a certificate of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">tax </i>good standing from the
          tax authorities. What�s the significance of that? It�s limited, but
          useful, according to Shipman. They will certify that there are no
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">assessed</i> taxes unpaid. How
          does assessment take place? Case law tells us that assessment occurs
          in the office of the tax official when that official makes the
          assessment by writing or typing in the office! It�s basically a claim
          by the tax commissioner that you owe money. Then the assessment is
          sent to you. This certificate will
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> deal with non-assessed
          tax claims. That is to say, all tax authorities will have informal or
          formal audits ongoing, or they will be planning them before the
          expiration of the statute of limitations. This certificate of tax good
          standing does not
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">estop</i> them as to that.
          However, it�s still a worthwhile document to obtain. It�s a part of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">due diligence</i>. In many
          states, a failure to file your tax return or pay your taxes on time
          can mean the loss of your corporate charter.</span

          had to be executed
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">under seal</i>. How do you do
          that? (1) �You can do like Julius Caesar did!� You put some wax on
          paper and take your ring and stick it on the wax. In the rest of the
          world they do a lot more of this formal stuff. (2) You can go to the
          store and have them print up wafer seals. You put some water on the
          back, and then put it on the document. �Not quite as good as a wax
          job, but it works. Nothing�s quite as good as a wax job.� (3) More
          often today, in states that require or give significance to the seal,
          you can simply put �L.S.�, meaning �in place of a seal�, and then you
          draw a squiggly, irregular closed line around it.</span

          to whether these were de jure corporations. If you�re only de facto or

          You must be de jure! The Illinois Supreme Court said that the

          (along with eight other western states), then if you�re putting a
          provision in a state constitution this way, you should add a last
          clause that says: �this provision is not merely directory to the
          legislature. This provision is the law and private citizens may sue on
          it and enforce it.�</span

          contracting with a corporation that hadn�t gotten its certificate

          corporate name, there was no individual guarantee from the shareholder
          then you have a corporation by estoppel, if not a de facto
          corporation. It takes a bit more to be a de facto corporation rather

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Timberline</i>, the courts had
          to follow what the statute said as to the people active in the
          formation and running of the company. There�s no out! They were liable
          just as general partners would be! Both cases, however, used a lot of
          common sense. As to purely inactive investors, in good faith, the
          joint and several liability would not apply. That is generally true
          throughout the </span

          spouse, parent, or child of the guy who is running the company.
          Shipman says that the courts are exactly right! The point of limited
          liability legislation is to get inactive investors to invest in
          business enterprises, and in a capitalist system, there are ups and
          downs. Maybe inactive investors are willing to risk $10,000 or
          $20,000, but not their home and everything else. That�s what makes the
          system work!</span

          organization in its common name simply for the recovery of the assets
          that the company has, the fact that it�s not incorporated or
          defectively incorporated is no defense. On the other hand, an
          unincorporated association or defective incorporated association suing
          someone else in contract or tort can do so in the common name. These
          are widespread statutes, but there are five or six states that don�t
          have them. In a state that doesn�t have such a statute and you�re
          suing a law firm, you need to make copies of the complaint for all the

          corporation sole. When they died, they would make out their will to
          their successor and the successor would take over. The Church asserted
          that the parent church could not be reached in tort and that each
          bishop was a corporation sole. In this country, there are three
          different theories of the Catholic Church. Churches may be centralized

          enumerate about 20 powers and then they would say: �the purposes are

          plead and prove recklessness. It�s an action by or on behalf of the
          corporation. That comes from R.C. 1701.59(D), which is about 50 years
          old. But that�s not the end of the story! Look at the �banking trauma�
          of the 80�s, when many banks and S &amp; Ls went out of business. The
          federal government had to spent billions cleaning it up. It cost a
          total of around $600 billion to taxpayers. The federal banking
          authorities have federal legislation saying that as to banks, a
          provision like R.C. 1701.59(D) can push the level down to gross
          negligence, but it can�t push it down to recklessness. In this case,
          what the officers and directors did was ultra vires because the
          charter forbade the loan and transaction made. They didn�t run it by a

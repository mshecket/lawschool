style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chiarella</span></i></span><span style='font-size:
14.0pt'> itself established that 10b-5 is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraud
</i>rule.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was amplified by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>SEC v. Dirks</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The latter case held that the tipper must
have violated his duty of loyalty to the company and must have received a
benefit, broadly defined, from doing so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A breach of the duty of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>care</i>
of the tipper to the company is not enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In a prior exam, the CEO of
an NYSE company went with an assistant to a local café, ordered too much to
drink, and talked way too loud to his assistant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the booth next to him was Mr. X, who owed
no fiduciary duty to the company or the two individuals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He overheard, and he went out and loaded up
on the company’s stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>10b-5 does not
apply to this situation because <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Chiarella</i></span> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dirks</i>,
insofar as 10b-5 is concerned, overrule the mere possession test of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas Gulf Sulfur</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is due to the literal language of 10b-5
because it’s a fraud statute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justice
Powell explained that journalists and others perform valuable functions in
society and in the securities markets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If a journalist gets a company official to say more than he should, with
the company official violating only his duty of care to the company and getting
no benefit, and the journalist spreads the word, then society is all the better
for it, so the journalist shouldn’t be punished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Consider 14e-3 in this
situation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The president and his
executive assistant were discussing a bigger NYSE company that was going to
pick up the subject NYSE <span class=GramE>company</span> in a statutory merger
at a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big</i> premium.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>confidential</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nobody knew it except the two companies and
their agents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both § 14(e) and 14e-3 are
limited to tender offers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the question
is whether a statutory merger or sale of all assets is ever a tender offer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The answer is no, because they are both non-coercive
in that the shareholders and board of directors must vote on it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A tender offer is more hostile and doesn’t
require shareholder or board approval.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So 14e-3 does not apply either.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However,
what Mr. X did in soliciting shareholders was probably a tender offer and there
was no compliance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If 14e-3 had been adopted
when <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Chiarella</i></span>
was decided, then Mr. <span class=SpellE>Chiarella</span> would have run afoul
of 14e-3 because the undisclosed information related to a tender offer and
under 14e-3 the mere possession test of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas
Gulf Sulfur</i>, in that limited <span class=GramE>circumstance,</span> is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reinstated</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is to say that the plaintiff need not
prove fraud, breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty, or benefit by the tipper.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is 14e-3 a valid Rule?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two big cases say yes, and Shipman says they’re
right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>United States v. <span class=SpellE>Chestman</span></i>, a criminal
case from the 1980’s from the Second Circuit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In this case, a wife of a top executive in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> was told by her husband that there was going to be a tender
offer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She called her daughter and
shared this, telling the daughter up front, “Don’t tell anyone else.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Never do that!)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The daughter then shared the information with
her husband.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The daughter did not tell
the husband that it was highly confidential.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The husband shared the information with his stock broker and doesn’t
tell the broker it’s confidential.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
the broker goes out and loads up on the company’s stock for himself and his
customers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There followed a criminal
prosecution under 14e-3 and 10b-5 of the stock broker.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The husband was granted immunity to testify
against the broker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a jury
conviction on both counts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case came
up before the Second Circuit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As to
10b-5, the court applies the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dirks</i>-<span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Chiarella</i></span>
test.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They hold that the government didn’t
prove that the daughter and the daughter’s husband were fiduciaries to each
other, and since the daughter didn’t get the husband to promise to keep it
confidential before she told him, the 10b-5 “chain” was broken, and thus the
broker’s conviction on the 10b-5 count had to be overturned.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But as to the 14e-3 count, they held that the
Rule is valid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They ruled that no fiduciary
duty need be found.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The conviction was
upheld and the sentence was not reduced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There are courts that would
hold that there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i> a fiduciary
duty between husband and wife under a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>status</i>
concept so long as they are living together and they’re not contemplating
divorce.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What the Court of Appeals held
was that they wouldn’t buy the status argument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They admitted that fiduciary duty and confidential handling of
information can flow from one of two sources: (1) status, which is the most
common, or (2) contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, if
the wife had said up front: “Husband, this must be kept in the strictest
confidence, and I’ll only tell you if you promise to keep it secret”, then
there is a contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By contrast, if a
cab driver overhears you talking on a cell phone about anything but a tender
offer, the cabbie can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pig out</i> on that
stock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, if you tell
the cab driver that you’re about to make a highly confidential call, ask him if
he will keep it confidential, and he says <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>yes</i>,
then there is a contractual fiduciary duty, and if the cab driver pigs out, he
violates Rule 10b-5.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A U.S. Supreme Court out of
the last five years upheld 14e-3.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the
process of doing so, they also discussed 10b-5.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A senior partner in a </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minneapolis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> law firm had embezzled $500,000 from clients and was
about to be found out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He needed a quick
fix.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A client of the firm was planning a
confidential tender offer at a big premium for the stock of X, Inc.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He bought a bunch of options on X, Inc. in
his own name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The SEC, as to the public
trading markets, now heavily relies on computers, though it wasn’t always so.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In Justice Ginsburg’s opinion on 10b-5, she
noted that the alleged wrongful sale or purchase must be proven to be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on account of</i> the inside
information.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She held that it was in
this particular case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The language of
this opinion led to the new rules 10-<span class=GramE>b5(</span>1) and
10-b5(2) where you can send notice to the SEC that you’re going to sell and if,
at the time, there is no undisclosed, unfavorable information, but such
information develops after that, you can still go ahead and sell under certain circumstances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Also in the last five years, Regulation
FD (“fair disclosure”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relates to
publicly reporting companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s
because it’s a rule under § 13, the reporting provision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If an officer or director spills the beans on
undisclosed information, then within two days you must publicly file a report
with the SEC as to “what the beans are” so that everybody can play on a level
playing field.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was very
controversial!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The SEC chairman barely
got it passed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The deciding vote came in
from one of the commissioners, who joined only after the Commission put in a
big exemption from the Rule: a bona fide member of the media doing bona fide
media work to whom the beans are spilled does not have to comply with Regulation
FD.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The holdout commissioner was
correct, in Shipman’s opinion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He didn’t
want the rule challenged on First Amendment grounds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Since the 1980’s, there have
been a number of amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on insider
trading.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>None of the statutes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>define</i> insider trading; Congress has
left that to the courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, there
are a number of very important provisions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One of them is that lawyers, CPA firms, investment bankers, and the
company itself must avoid reckless conduct in safeguarding material,
undisclosed inside information.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In one
of Shipman’s exam questions, a guy is a partner in a law firm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His son goes to the office and the father
takes a phone call while the father is in the office.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The call is from someone planning a big tender
offer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The son is a party animal!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He’s also quick-witted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He’s <span class=GramE>a finance</span>
major.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He leaves and pigs out.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do we advice the senior partner of the
law firm when the FBI appears?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First, we
tell him to be nice to the FBI.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next, we
advise him that the partner was reckless in talking in front of his son.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don’t share confidential information with
anybody.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The partner is going to pay
treble damages!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a civil action, the
SEC can triple the ante!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The partner
must come up with the big money to get the SEC and FBI off of the firm’s
back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have to give it to him
straight, according to Shipman.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s his
problem, not the firm’s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, all law
firms have very careful written procedures on buying and selling securities
that you must adhere to.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you work for
a firm that does a lot of takeover work, the spouse should invest in mutual
funds, not stocks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Pigging out is a
basic human instinct!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This is an area of heavy legislative
challenge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 1995 Act, as to fraud
actions involving securities, put a whole new layer of restrictions on class
actions or quasi-class actions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A
quasi-class action is where twenty individual shareholders bring twenty
different suits on the same transaction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The 1998 Act expanded this, saying that if the class action involving
fraud and securities is in the state courts under state law, then the defendants
can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>remove</i> them to the (more defendant-friendly)
federal courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The newest kid on the
block, about to be born, is a bill before the Senate this week.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a class action bill recently passed by
the House.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s broader than securities
and says that as <span class=GramE>to</span> many class actions entirely under
state law, even if only negligence is alleged, the defendants may remove to the
federal courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is very popular in
the House, but not popular with the federal bench.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the Senate, it’s going to be close.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shipman predicts it will become law
eventually.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the state level, there

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>More on 10b-5</span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chiarella</span></i></span><span style='font-size:
14.0pt'> itself established that 10b-5 is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fraud
</i>rule. That was amplified by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>SEC v. Dirks</i>. The latter case held that the tipper must
have violated his duty of loyalty to the company and must have received a
benefit, broadly defined, from doing so. A breach of the duty of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>care</i>
of the tipper to the company is not enough.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In a prior exam, the CEO of
an NYSE company went with an assistant to a local café, ordered too much to
drink, and talked way too loud to his assistant. In the booth next to him was Mr. X, who owed
no fiduciary duty to the company or the two individuals. He overheard, and he went out and loaded up
on the company’s stock. 10b-5 does not
apply to this situation because <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Chiarella</i></span> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dirks</i>,
insofar as 10b-5 is concerned, overrule the mere possession test of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas Gulf Sulfur</i>. This is due to the literal language of 10b-5
because it’s a fraud statute. Justice
Powell explained that journalists and others perform valuable functions in
society and in the securities markets. If a journalist gets a company official to say more than he should, with
the company official violating only his duty of care to the company and getting
no benefit, and the journalist spreads the word, then society is all the better
for it, so the journalist shouldn’t be punished.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Consider 14e-3 in this
situation. The president and his
executive assistant were discussing a bigger NYSE company that was going to
pick up the subject NYSE <span class=GramE>company</span> in a statutory merger
at a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big</i> premium. This was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>confidential</i>. Nobody knew it except the two companies and
their agents. Both § 14(e) and 14e-3 are
limited to tender offers. So the question
is whether a statutory merger or sale of all assets is ever a tender offer. The answer is no, because they are both non-coercive
in that the shareholders and board of directors must vote on it. A tender offer is more hostile and doesn’t
require shareholder or board approval. So 14e-3 does not apply either. However,
what Mr. X did in soliciting shareholders was probably a tender offer and there
was no compliance.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If 14e-3 had been adopted
when <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Chiarella</i></span>
was decided, then Mr. <span class=SpellE>Chiarella</span> would have run afoul
of 14e-3 because the undisclosed information related to a tender offer and
under 14e-3 the mere possession test of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Texas
Gulf Sulfur</i>, in that limited <span class=GramE>circumstance,</span> is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reinstated</i>. That is to say that the plaintiff need not
prove fraud, breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty, or benefit by the tipper. Is 14e-3 a valid Rule? Two big cases say yes, and Shipman says they’re
right. The first is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>United States v. <span class=SpellE>Chestman</span></i>, a criminal
case from the 1980’s from the Second Circuit. In this case, a wife of a top executive in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> was told by her husband that there was going to be a tender
offer. She called her daughter and
shared this, telling the daughter up front, “Don’t tell anyone else.” (Never do that!) The daughter then shared the information with
her husband. The daughter did not tell
the husband that it was highly confidential. The husband shared the information with his stock broker and doesn’t
tell the broker it’s confidential. So
the broker goes out and loads up on the company’s stock for himself and his
customers.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There followed a criminal
prosecution under 14e-3 and 10b-5 of the stock broker. The husband was granted immunity to testify
against the broker. There was a jury
conviction on both counts. The case came
up before the Second Circuit. As to
10b-5, the court applies the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dirks</i>-<span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Chiarella</i></span>
test. They hold that the government didn’t
prove that the daughter and the daughter’s husband were fiduciaries to each
other, and since the daughter didn’t get the husband to promise to keep it
confidential before she told him, the 10b-5 “chain” was broken, and thus the
broker’s conviction on the 10b-5 count had to be overturned. But as to the 14e-3 count, they held that the
Rule is valid. They ruled that no fiduciary
duty need be found. The conviction was
upheld and the sentence was not reduced.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>There are courts that would
hold that there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>always</i> a fiduciary
duty between husband and wife under a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>status</i>
concept so long as they are living together and they’re not contemplating
divorce. What the Court of Appeals held
was that they wouldn’t buy the status argument. They admitted that fiduciary duty and confidential handling of
information can flow from one of two sources: (1) status, which is the most
common, or (2) contract. For example, if
the wife had said up front: “Husband, this must be kept in the strictest
confidence, and I’ll only tell you if you promise to keep it secret”, then
there is a contract. By contrast, if a
cab driver overhears you talking on a cell phone about anything but a tender
offer, the cabbie can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pig out</i> on that
stock. On the other hand, if you tell
the cab driver that you’re about to make a highly confidential call, ask him if
he will keep it confidential, and he says <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>yes</i>,
then there is a contractual fiduciary duty, and if the cab driver pigs out, he
violates Rule 10b-5.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A U.S. Supreme Court out of
the last five years upheld 14e-3. In the
process of doing so, they also discussed 10b-5. A senior partner in a </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Minneapolis</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> law firm had embezzled $500,000 from clients and was
about to be found out. He needed a quick
fix. A client of the firm was planning a
confidential tender offer at a big premium for the stock of X, Inc. He bought a bunch of options on X, Inc. in
his own name. The SEC, as to the public
trading markets, now heavily relies on computers, though it wasn’t always so. In Justice Ginsburg’s opinion on 10b-5, she
noted that the alleged wrongful sale or purchase must be proven to be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on account of</i> the inside
information. She held that it was in
this particular case. The language of
this opinion led to the new rules 10-<span class=GramE>b5(</span>1) and
10-b5(2) where you can send notice to the SEC that you’re going to sell and if,
at the time, there is no undisclosed, unfavorable information, but such
information develops after that, you can still go ahead and sell under certain circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Also in the last five years, Regulation
FD (“fair disclosure”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relates to
publicly reporting companies. That’s
because it’s a rule under § 13, the reporting provision. If an officer or director spills the beans on
undisclosed information, then within two days you must publicly file a report
with the SEC as to “what the beans are” so that everybody can play on a level
playing field. This was very
controversial! The SEC chairman barely
got it passed. The deciding vote came in
from one of the commissioners, who joined only after the Commission put in a
big exemption from the Rule: a bona fide member of the media doing bona fide
media work to whom the beans are spilled does not have to comply with Regulation
FD. The holdout commissioner was
correct, in Shipman’s opinion. He didn’t
want the rule challenged on First Amendment grounds.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Since the 1980’s, there have
been a number of amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on insider
trading. None of the statutes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>define</i> insider trading; Congress has
left that to the courts. However, there
are a number of very important provisions. One of them is that lawyers, CPA firms, investment bankers, and the
company itself must avoid reckless conduct in safeguarding material,
undisclosed inside information. In one
of Shipman’s exam questions, a guy is a partner in a law firm. His son goes to the office and the father
takes a phone call while the father is in the office. The call is from someone planning a big tender
offer. The son is a party animal! He’s also quick-witted. He’s <span class=GramE>a finance</span>
major. He leaves and pigs out. How do we advice the senior partner of the
law firm when the FBI appears? First, we
tell him to be nice to the FBI. Next, we
advise him that the partner was reckless in talking in front of his son. Don’t share confidential information with
anybody. The partner is going to pay
treble damages! In a civil action, the
SEC can triple the ante! The partner
must come up with the big money to get the SEC and FBI off of the firm’s
back. You have to give it to him
straight, according to Shipman. It’s his
problem, not the firm’s. Also, all law
firms have very careful written procedures on buying and selling securities
that you must adhere to. If you work for
a firm that does a lot of takeover work, the spouse should invest in mutual
funds, not stocks. Pigging out is a
basic human instinct!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>These three duties overlap
heavily. Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure 23 and 23.1 have to do with kinds of class actions. <span class=GramE>23.1 deals with a shareholder
bringing a suit <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on behalf of</i> the corporation.</span> The duty doesn’t run to the shareholder
personally, but it does run to the corporation. It’s a lot harder to start a Rule 23.1 action off the ground than it is
to get a Rule 23 action started. Under <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i>, as to close corporations
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, one of the express holdings is that if it’s
something that before </span><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
 style='font-size:14.0pt'>Crosby</span></i></st1:place><span style='font-size:
14.0pt'> you had to assert derivatively, you can now go directly if it’s a
close corporation. Why might you want to
avoid a class action? Class
certification is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big</i> hurdle on
things like preemptive rights. You’d
rather just bring it directly.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This is an area of heavy legislative
challenge. The 1995 Act, as to fraud
actions involving securities, put a whole new layer of restrictions on class
actions or quasi-class actions. A
quasi-class action is where twenty individual shareholders bring twenty
different suits on the same transaction. The 1998 Act expanded this, saying that if the class action involving
fraud and securities is in the state courts under state law, then the defendants
can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>remove</i> them to the (more defendant-friendly)
federal courts. The newest kid on the
block, about to be born, is a bill before the Senate this week. It’s a class action bill recently passed by
the House. It’s broader than securities
and says that as <span class=GramE>to</span> many class actions entirely under
state law, even if only negligence is alleged, the defendants may remove to the
federal courts. This is very popular in
the House, but not popular with the federal bench. In the Senate, it’s going to be close. Shipman predicts it will become law
eventually. At the state level, there
has been a lot of tort reform action, including in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This case stands for the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>business judgment rule on the merits</i>. This is duty of care only. The directors were the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>cream</i> of the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt'>Chicago</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style='font-size:14.0pt'> business
community. The action was brought as a
class action after the merger rather than a derivative action. The class action was approved by the Chancery
Court and the Supreme Court does not upset it. There was no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>special litigation
committee</i> to pass on the action. The
old man had met with <span class=SpellE>Pritzker</span>, of medical school
fame. They went to the opera. <span class=SpellE>Pritzker</span> said: “I’ll
make cash merger offer to all of your shareholders at a 33% cash premium and I
want you to support it. I want the board
to agree not to shop it around.” The
company counsel tells him that if he doesn’t accept the offer, he could be held
liable in a shareholder derivative action. So about an hour later, the deal is green-lighted. Keep in mind the big premium and the sterling
reputation of the <span class=SpellE>Pritzkers</span>. Because of the no-shop clauses, they never
sought an alternative deal. The deal was
submitted to shareholders, who overwhelmingly approved it. The merger closed, and then this action was
brought after the fact. The chancellor
threw the case out under the business judgment rule, saying that the board met
and considered the deal and thus it was fine.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This case hit the corporate

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zahn</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> v. Transamerica</i>, the first big 10b-5 case, insider trading was
rife! The Delaware Supreme Court says
that the business judgment rule can be shredded by the plaintiff showing (1)
fraud, (2) ultra vires, (3) bad faith, (4) arbitrary or capricious action, or (5)
waste (recklessness by the directors). But then they added: (6) gross negligence on the merits, and (7) <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>procedural </i>gross negligence. Here, the Delaware Supreme Court said that there
was procedural gross negligence by the board, which gets us into the role of shareholder
approval in a public company in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In Delaware, the rule, at
least since the 1940’s has been that if holders of a disinterested majority of
shares, after full and fair disclosure up-front, vote <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

judgment rule is broadened. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>, if you have such approval and creditors aren’t hurt,

Ohio Supreme Court. The Ohio Supreme
Court held that even if there were fraud upon the company, if the fraud were
openly and fully discussed in the proxy statement asking for the shareholders
not to sue and shareholders holding a disinterested majority vote <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not to sue</i>, then it will be okay. This didn’t work to save the defendants here

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The opinion of the Delaware Supreme
Court can be fundamentally criticized. The remand scared the directors witless, because the potential liability
could be tens of millions of dollars. It
was settled out at around $20 million, of which the insurance company supplied
about $14-15 million. <span
class=SpellE>Pritzker</span> threw in the other $5 million. What the court failed to make clear on remand
was that this was a strict duty of care action. Most of the directors of the company were independent, outside directors
in every sense. Even the old man, the
CEO, who put pressure on the directors was not engaged in a conflict of interest. The <span class=GramE>duty of care, like a
fraud action, both are</span> standard tort actions. Like standard tort actions for damages, the plaintiff
must plead and prove causation-in-fact. Here, there was a 33% premium. What they failed to emphasize was that the company may have been fully
priced out, and if the jury finds this to be the case then there is no legal
damage should because there is no causation-in-fact. Later cases recognize this, but <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>duty of loyalty is different</i>. It’s trickier and in a lot of ways much more plaintiff-oriented. If Del. § 102(b) or R.C. 1701.59(D) had been
in effect at the time of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Smith v. Van <span
class=SpellE>Gorkum</span></i>, it is doubtful that the plaintiff would have
been able to show a cause of action. It
would be next to impossible to show that the action was reckless. But let’s say the action arose in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> in 2004 under .59(D). The action would be reckless now because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

find recklessness.</span></p>

back to court, and if it is proven that the committee is disinterested and
proceeded diligently and in good faith, and had independent lawyers and CPAs,
then the court would dismiss the case. There was authority in the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

style='font-size:14.0pt'>. <i

action brought against a company and its directors and officers on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> duty of loyalty and duty of care
grounds. In the real world, plaintiffs
will allege breaches of all three branches of the fiduciary principle,
including also the duty of full and fair disclosure up-front. A special litigation committee of squeaky
clean people is selected. They hire
independent legal counsel and independent CPAs. They conclude that the suit is not in the best interests of the
company. That’s every defense lawyer’s
dream! There’s something to it: even if
you have a good cause of action, you often are better off not pursuing it. For example, you have a good tort suit
against X, but if you sue, then you’ll expose yourself to criminal liability. If you are the lawyer for the defendant, you
cannot explicitly raise this in negotiations with the plaintiff. But everyone is aware of it. A wise defendant will settle for a few
thousand dollars.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When the motions are filed,
the chancellor says that derivative actions are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

look at the business judgment defense on the merits, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>but</i> not the business judgment defense of procedure. This goes up to the Delaware Supreme Court,
which holds that either on a demand-excused action or demand-required action,
the chancellor is to exercise her business judgment in reviewing the business
judgment of the special litigation committee. The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The old man is the CEO,
president, and majority shareholder. Most of the directors are his friends who have no business connection
with him or the company. They’re not
officers or employees, but they’re all social friends of the president, which
is no surprise. The plaintiff’s petition
under 23.1 must state whether demands have been made on directors, and if not,
it must state why not. The plaintiff
alleges in his petition that demand was not made because it would be futile to
make demand on the directors. In the old
days, on these facts, when you made all of the directors defendants in good
faith, they would “wave you through”. Note that the defendants’ lawyers, acting under Rule 23.1, before the answer
is filed, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>moved for dismissal</i> on the
grounds that the demand should have been made but wasn’t. The court uses the complaint to determine
what the plaintiff alleged, which was that most of the directors were not
officers or employees and had no business relationship with the CEO, but that
all of them were close social friends.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The court first holds that
the mere fact that a director is a social friend of the controlling shareholder
or inside directors does <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> ipso
facto make that person an inside director. The court also establishes that where you have a compensation question
and most of the directors passing on the compensation are independent, outside
directors, you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must</i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>allege waste</i>, that is, recklessness
concerning the compensation. That’s
important because neither directors nor shareholders can ratify or decide not
to sue on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>waste</i>. The court holds that where you claim that
demand is excused, you must be very clear and detailed and complete on your
allegations. For example, one allegation
in the complaint is that the old man is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>old</i>,
and the plaintiff alleges that’s enough to show he’s not worth what a younger
man would be worth. The court says that
this is not nearly good enough. You must
show <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>waste</i> in detail, that is, that
the old man’s mental or physical capacities are at such a point that paying him
such a good salary is a waste of corporate assets and you would have to allege,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in detail</i>, why that’s true. If, for example, the old man had advanced
Alzheimer’s, that would be good enough.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Therefore, on this Rule 23.1
motion (before an answer is filed and well before summary judgment), the Supreme
Court ruled that the Court of Chancery ought to dismiss. Sometimes, the plaintiff will be allowed to <span
class=SpellE>refile</span>, but other times the dismissal can be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>with prejudice</i>, saying that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>it’s all over</i>. If the action is an individual action or a
class action under Rule 23, the particular defense that the plaintiff should
have made demand on directors but didn’t is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not
available</i>. In general, avoid Rule
23.1 if you can if you’re a plaintiff.</span></p>

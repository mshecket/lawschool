style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general </i>partnership? Here’s the definition: A <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>general partnership </i>is one in which <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all</i> partners are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general </i>partners. The emphasis here is on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>general</i>. Under UPA §§ 1-18,
plus 40, there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>joint and several
liability</i> on the part of all partners for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>tort</i> debts of the general partnership, and there is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>joint</i> liability for all of the partners’
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contract </i>debts. When you read §§ 18 and 40 and put them
together, you will find that you can sue not only the partnership for the
assets it has, but if it doesn’t have enough, you can go after the individual
partners and reach their personal estates. Ouch! That’s called the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>disadvantage of unlimited personal liability</i>. It’s a big disadvantage…how come? No one with any sense advertently forms a
general partnership today. For a lawyer
to recommend it is malpractice <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se</i>. Why? We’ll
find at the end of the course that in the last 25 years, the LLC has arrived
and the Ohio LLC statute, O.R.C. § 1705, is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>excellent</i>. The LLC, with proper drafting, will give the
tax advantages of a general partnership with the limited liability advantage of
a corporation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So what is the great tax advantage of general
partnerships? Corporations in this
country historically have been subject to a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>double
tax</i>. It’s been modified a lot in the
last 45 years, but big portions of it still remain. This is because a corporation is considered
as a full-fledged legal entity separate from the shareholders for tax and other
purposes. As such, historically, the
corporation was subject to tax on what it earned, and then, when it paid
dividends, the dividends were fully taxable again to the shareholder
recipients. By the end of today, we’ll
see that there have been two ameliorations of that, though to some extent it’s
still true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The U.S. Supreme Court
upheld the ability of Congress to do this even before the Sixteenth Amendment
was passed. It was said that the
government bestows the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>privilege</i> upon
people to set up an entity with limited liability, and thus Congress can levy a
tax on that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>privilege</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A general partnership, because it has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>three strong non-resemblances to a corporation</i>, is not subject to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>income </i>taxes. The emphasis is on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>income</i> taxes, because a general partnership is subject to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>excise </i>taxes, it must withhold taxes on
salaries of employees, it is subject to sales taxes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>but</i> it isn’t subject to income taxes. How has Congress treated general partnerships
since 1913? They have said that, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in general</i>, with some exceptions to
follow later, the partnership is considered a non-entity for income tax
purposes. The income and losses of the
partnership <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>flow through</i> to the
individual partners and is taxed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>to them</i>. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>However</i>,
by statute, the partnership must file <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>information</i>
returns with the IRS. Those information
returns enable the IRS to collect from the partners.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>As to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>employees</i> of
the partnership, they’re just like corporate employees. The partnership must pay and withhold Social
Security tax. Partners pay taxes just
like sole proprietors. Each quarter,
they must file a declaration of estimated taxes for the year and pay one-fourth
of it. When they file their final
return, they “settle up”. If they paid
too much, they’ll get a refund, and if they paid too little, they’ll have to
write another check to the IRS. Until
1960, general partnerships were very popular in the service areas, for example,
law, accounting, medicine, dentistry, and engineering. This is because there was no double taxation,
and state statutes as to law, doctors, dentists and accountants provided that
those professions had to practice as sole proprietors or general partnerships
to expose to the world not only the assets the partnership owned, but also the
personal property of the partners individually.</p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:1'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Congress discerned that there were three significant
non-corporate attributes of a general partnership: (1) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Personal
liability </i>of all of the partners for the debts of the partnership in
addition to the partnership itself being liable. (2) §§ 18-32 of the UPA 1914 introduce us to
the idea that a general partnership is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>easily
dissolved</i>. Dissolution is defined
specially in the UPA as a “change in legal relationship among the
partners”. The death, retirement, or
bankruptcy of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> general partner
causes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dissolution</i> of the
partnership, but not the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>death</i> of the
partnership. The party <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>leaving</i> the partnership by death,
retirement, or bankruptcy is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entitled </i>to
the amount credited to her capital account <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>soon</i>. Compare this to the situation of Jones Retail
Store, Inc. It has four siblings working
in the store. Upon the death of one of
the Jones siblings, there is no dissolution, meaning that the widow of the
dying Jones sibling <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cannot</i> get the
fair value of the shares from the company <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless
</i>there is a specific contractual provision to the contrary. That’s just the opposite from a general
partnership because the death, retirement, bankruptcy, or insanity of one or
more shareholders of a corporation does <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>
affect the ongoing life of the corporation. The corollary to that is that the same is true even if one or more or
all of the shareholders assign all of their shares to somebody else. Thus, the corporation is guaranteed by law to
have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perpetual life</i>! <span class=GramE>Whereas with the general
partnership, death, retirement, bankruptcy or insanity cause dissolution.</span> The guy who went crazy can withdraw his whole
capital account. (3) With a corporation,
unless there are valid reasonable restraints on alienation, any or all
shareholders can sell any or all of their shares to anyone for any reason <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at any time</i>. Needless to say, even the closely held
corporation with a few shareholders is set up in such a way to sell its shares
to the public if the public wants it. The general partnership, on the other hand, is set up for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-public ownership</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>These three differences led Congress to say that a general
partnership doesn’t resemble a corporation very much. When we get to the LLC, clever drafters at
the state level came up with a new animal from civil law countries like <st1:country-region><st1:place>Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>:
the LLC, which had limited liability. The Clinton Administration was persuaded that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>most </i>unincorporated business associations, if they “checked the
box” on their first return saying that they wanted to be treated as a general
partnership for tax purposes, then they’ll be treated that way. (Subchapter K is the subchapter of the
internal revenue code that deals with partnerships.)</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We will primarily be studying the Uniform Partnership Act of
1914. The book has many references to
the Revised Uniform Partnership Act of the last 15 years. The Revised Act has notes that are very good
research tools; so does the original. In
<st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, our Act is close to the old
one with one <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>maddening</i> change: the
numbers in the O.R.C. are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one off!</i> Partnerships and <span class=SpellE>LLCs</span>
are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deep <span class=SpellE>jello</span></i>. Your client can get screwed very, very
fast. We will make analogies to
corporations, which Shipman proposes are much more logical.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Just what is a partnership? Read §§ 1-8 and you get the picture. Partnership is created when there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>co-ownership
of a business for profit</i>. If you’re
in the not-for-profit realm, look at R.C. Chapter 1702 and go to a
not-for-profit corporation! Never use
unincorporated business forms for a not-for-profit association! On the other hand, the definition of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>business</i> in the cases is broad. <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
cases in the last thirty years have applied the statute to lottery tickets, for
example. Jack says to Jill: “I’m going
to buy some lottery tickets with this number.” Jill says: “Buy one for me too.” He buys two $5 tickets, and they win! Jill, in most states, can assert partnership law and get half of what
those two tickets are worth. In
addition, in a <st1:State><st1:place>Mississippi</st1:place></st1:State> case
after World War II, a brother wanted to engage in a business operation. His sister sent him some money that looked
like a loan. The operation took off like
gangbusters, and it was held that the brother and sister were 50-50 partners
and the brother had to split with the sister. If there had been a big tort liability, the sister would have argued
that opposite: that she was a mere creditor.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Partnerships come in two flavors: today and tomorrow we will
discuss <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>advertent</i> partnerships. On Wednesday, we’ll talk about <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inadvertent</i> partnerships. It is malpractice for a lawyer to recommend a
plain vanilla UPA general partnership today! Use the LLC or a corporation! But
aren’t a lot of law firms set up as <span class=SpellE>LLPs</span>? Those are general partnerships with some limitation
of tort liability but no limitation of tort liability. That’s just wrong and bad! They should be <span class=SpellE>LLCs</span>
instead. But don’t worry unless you’re
going to become a partner. There is no
such thing as an inadvertent LLC or corporation.</p>

<p><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Richert</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. <span class=SpellE>Handly</span> </i>–
How does the statute of frauds apply to partnerships? A famous <st1:City><st1:place>Houston</st1:place></st1:City>
lawyer got out of the issue on the basis of the statute of frauds. If it involves real estate, here in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
we have strong partial performance doctrines that may well override a lot of
the authority other places.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76361581"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Assumed name statutes</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you are doing business under an assumed name, you are
supposed to file an assumed name certificate. As to a partnership, the statute is especially demanding in that if you
are a partnership and the firm name contains less than all of the names of all
of the partners, the county recorder is not to accept real estate documents
unless there is an assumed name certificate filed. If the firm name is Smith &amp; Jones and
there is only Smith and only Jones, you’re okay. But if you’re in Baker &amp; Hostetler, there
are a lot more partners than just Baker or Hostetler.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76361582"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Partnership property</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Partnership property can still be partnership property even
if it’s in the name of one of the partners. You don’t want to run a partnership that way; you want to put
partnership property in the partnership name. Before the Uniform Partnership Act of 1914, partnership property had to
be held in a <span class=SpellE>cotenancy</span> by partnership. The Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 says you
can clearly hold partnership property in the partnership name. Common name statutes in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and most states say that if you’re suing a partnership simply to bind the
partnership assets, the statute will come to your aid if it’s not a very big deal. Likewise, a partnership can use the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
common name statute to sue with just one signature: that of the managing
partner. That’s true in most American
states, though it’s not so in three or four states. Do partnerships ever issue stock certificates
or anything similar? No, it’s the
partnership agreement that governs. There are no stock certificates.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We have a Paul Bunyan at the bar, and a capitalist comes
up. He just bought a timber-cutting
agreement. He says: “Let’s chop some
wood!” Bunyan asks: “How much timber is
there?” Bunyan looks, comes back and
says: “You’re 30% too high.” But they
agree anyhow, explicitly agreeing on a 50-50 profit split. They also explicitly agree that sweat equity
(Bunyan) was to use his tractor and other equipment. He was to be paid “above the line”, that is,
before computation of net loss, and he was to be reimbursed for the use of his
tractor. Nothing was said about interest
about capital, meaning that there shall be no interest on capital. Nothing was said about the partner’s salary.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Was this agreement void because it was not in writing? No, because it was fully performed
already. A general partnership was
created. The timber was cut and
sold. Each party had a capital
account. The capital account goes up by
the assets you contribute and by your share of the net profits. It goes down by your share of the net
losses. This was a partnership for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one transaction</i>: the timber under the
timber lease. The tax return was
prepared by a CPA, who gave copies to both parties. The partnership agreement may be subject to
amendment by conduct, including how the tax return is prepared. Either partner can sign, but the others are
entitled to a copy of the return and a statement of their distributive share of
all items. The CPA computed the return
and found that overall there had been a loss and that the loss is allocable
50-50 between the partners. Clearly, the
profits were to be divided equally. The
CPA, in effect, said that there was a negative balance in the capital account
of Sweat Equity. The purpose of the
partnership was completed. There was <span
class=GramE>a dissolution</span>. With a
general partnership, very often you have to use the traditional method of
accounting to settle up. There is a
major Ohio Supreme Court case from the 1980’s and a major <st1:State><st1:place>Arizona</st1:place></st1:State>
case from the 1970’s to the contrary. Accounting is always <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in equity</i>. The partnership and all partners are
parties. Most often, the cost of the
accounting is borne by the partnership itself.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What was the problem? Bunyan thought that the deal that had been cut was “profits: 50-50 and
losses: 100-0”. Could that deal have
explicitly been made as between the parties up-front? Sure, under § 18, which merely gives you
default rules. If the parties <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>had</i> expressly so agreed up-front and
there had been a tort liability, would that bind the injured third party? Would it have bound contract creditors? No. Just read § 18 and you’ll see that it will not bind those third
parties. But if all creditors have been
paid and there are no tort liabilities, then this is merely between the
parties. The Supreme Court holds that §
18 <span class=GramE>is</span> clear: you agreed on the profit ratio while your
handshake agreement was silent on the loss ratio. In that situation, the loss ratio is the same
as the profit ratio. Bunyan isn’t
happy! But he does get a tax
deduction. In <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>,
the courts will usually reach a different result. In some other states, they might reach a
different result if they can find <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no
partnership</i>. If there’s a loss, and
there is sweat equity, in some states they will say that no partnership was
formed. But this is the minority rule.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Many law firms have a “draw” against profits. They set up a formula by which the partners
can periodically draw out about half of what the firm estimates will be the
profits for the year. Note that if the
draw against profits is greater than what the profits turn out to be, the
partner will get a note from the senior partner asking for his check within ten
days. If the draw is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>less</i>, as it usually is, within about two
weeks after the end of the year, the partner will get the difference from the
firm. Cautious law firms never borrow
money to pay partners’ draws. With one
big law firm in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>, there
is no payment during the year. They wait
until January, and then write a check. During the year, the partners must write checks for estimated tax, and
they’ll have no idea how much to pay and no money to pay it with. <span class=SpellE>Skadden</span> <span
class=SpellE>Arps</span> only distributes 83% in any year, though you pay tax
on 100%. That’s because they want to
build up their internal finances. When
you retire, you have several million dollars in the capital account that you
have already paid taxes on. Don’t borrow
money for partners’ draws!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bane v. </i><st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ferguson</i></st1:place></st1:City> – Here
we have non-qualified, unfunded pension plans for partners of law firms. They are becoming less common because they
tend to create a strain between the younger partners and the older, retired
partners. Most law firms today just set
up the H.R. 10 plan for the self-employed and encourage partners to contribute
to it. This plan is not nearly as
liberal as the provisions under § 404 for a qualified pension plan. A partnership cannot have a qualified pension
plan, but a corporation can. If you want
the other fringe benefits like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, disability, or long term
care, you must go to a Sub C corporation. There are a few law firms that do it, but it is more common physicians
for some reason. The question in the
case was the non-qualified plan provided that it ended when the firm
ended. The plaintiff was a retired who
had moved to <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State> and was
getting $27,000 a year out of the pension plan. The firm entered into a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>disastrous</i>
amalgamation with another partnership, became insolvent, and went out of business. The plaintiff sued, claiming that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>somehow</i>, either in tort or contract law,
he had the right to keep the firm going. But the plan itself provided that it terminated if the firm went out of
existence. There was no fraud or bad
faith. There is also no wrongful,
intentional interference with a contract. The court holds that the partnership will not be kept open.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Rouse v. Pollard</i> –
Here we had a very prestigious <st1:State><st1:place>New Jersey</st1:place></st1:State>
firm. A partner decided he wasn’t making
enough from the firm alone. He started
confidential conferences with rich old ladies and told them he was running his
own private investment operation on the side. He wanted the checks made payable to him alone. This did not appear on the law firm time
records. No one else at the firm knew or
had reason to know of his activities. Note that for purposes of the securities laws he was selling an
investment contract. Most law firms <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>absolutely</i> prohibit anything approaching
this. If he had taken the money and made
a profit for the clients, probably no one would have sued. But people who do this kind of thing are
probably more or less perpetrating a fraud, and this fellow was no
exception. He embezzled his clients’
money. He got caught and went to state
prison. The old ladies were out a lot of
money. They had an action again him, of
course, for the breach of his fiduciary duty, but he had spent all their money
already. Then they sued the law
firm. They latched onto §§ 9-18 of the
Uniform Partnership Act of 1914, which impose a respondeat superior regime upon
acts in the ordinary course of business. Since the dealings never got on the firm records, the checks were made
out to the individual attorney, and there was no evidence that the other
partners knew or had reason to know of his dealings, the court holds that the
law firm is off the hook.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roach v. Mead</i> –
Here we have different facts. This case
cites an earlier case of the Oregon Supreme Court, <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Croisant</i></span>. The partnership here was an accounting
partnership. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>One of the partnership’s
clients was a wealthy businesswoman who planned to go to <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>
for three months. She went to the
partner that she usually dealt with and told him that she would put his
signature on her bank account. She
wanted him to pay her bills while she was out of the country. This conference was entered on the time
records of the firm. The firm billed her
for the work that the partner did. She
came back from <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and, at first, everything seemed
okay. He had paid all of her legitimate
bills. Later, however, she found out
that the partner had paid the expenses of her husband’s lover while she was
gone. She was very mad! The partner died, either by suicide or an
accident. She clearly had a cause of
action against his estate, but the CPA firm itself was much more inviting. The CPA firm would have had a general
liability policy and a malpractice policy. Both of these policies probably excluded anything dishonest, criminal,
malicious, or intentional. But the firm
was big enough that the assets of the firm plus the personal assets of all the
partners were large enough to support a judgment. Note that this came years before the
LLP. The court held that the partner’s
actions <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were</i> in the normal course of
business. What should the lady have
done? She should have required the
signature of both her CPA firm and her lawyer for checks while she was gone.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The facts of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roach</i>
itself are as follows: there was a two person general partnership long before
there were <span class=SpellE>LLPs</span>. One of the partners did some real estate speculation on his own and lost
his shirt. One of his clients who he
serviced was rich and the lawyer hit him up for a personal loan. The check was made out to the partner in his
personal name. The loan was never
repaid, and that partner is judgment-proof. The client gets a different lawyer, of course. Could the client sue the one lawyer alone and
get his partnership interest? No,
because §§ 15-38 of the Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 state that an
individual creditor of a partner can levy upon the partnership interest, which
allows a kind of weird remedy: a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charging
order</i> on his earnings from the partnership. Shipman thinks this would include both a guaranteed salary and a share
of profits. He’s pretty sure that the
restrictions on wage garnishment would not apply because a partner’s earnings
or salary are not wages. This is
different than a share of stock: you can’t cause the interest to be paid over
and cause <span class=GramE>a dissolution</span>. Furthermore, the other partner or partners
can redeem the partner’s interest. Shipman says that it’s not a great remedy. Partnership or LLC interest is basically not
good collateral.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The lawyer sued the partnership under §§ 1-18 and 40 saying
that there was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>negligence</i> in what the
partner did, and that the negligence led to the client’s loss. He served both partners individually as well
as the law firm. He claimed that the
partnership itself was liable as was the innocent partner. Negligence was used to dig into the
malpractice policy of the law firm. He
claimed that what the lawyer did was negligence only. What rules of professional ethics were
violated? Canon 5 and the rules <span
class=SpellE>thereunder</span> tell us that one of the stupidest things a
lawyer can do is enter into personal or financial relationships with clients. It is clear that a lawyer must give all kinds
of warnings of the dangers of a personal loan to the client. Here, the lawyer did not inform the client
that he ought to insist on a first mortgage on the lawyer’s house. The rule is even stricter with trustees. The court holds that the partnership and the
other partner are on the hook.</p>

<p><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Meinhard</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Salmon</i> – This is a partnership
opportunity case. There was a capitalist
and sweat equity who get together around 1900. Sweat Equity is a real estate expert. Sweat Equity wants Capitalist to advance some money. They plan to go 50-50 on earnings. All the assets were put in Sweat Equity’s
name. Capitalist was a “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>secret partner</i>” of the general
partnership. Most people think that
secret partners are just as liable as regular partners. Sub-partnership leads to the same result:
Smith is a general partner in a construction firm. He goes to his brother and he and the brother
enter into a sub-partnership in Smith’s share of the partnership. It is generally held that Smith’s brother
will be held liable just like any other general partner. Many lawyers in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
will tell the bank if it wants to levy on a general partnership interest that
it may well have the same liability for the partnership debts and obligations
as their debtor has. The law is not
clear on this. Was there any tax impact
upon the formation of this partnership? It was before the federal income <span class=GramE>tax was enacted, but
let’s presume</span> this happened in the present. The Internal Revenue Code says that if the
person contributing property has his capital account credited for the fair
market value of the property and if Sweat Equity doesn’t receive an addition to
his capital account because of services, then the transaction will be tax-free.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Over 12-15 years there were rocky times, but Sweat Equity
generally did well. The only problem was
that Sweat Equity didn’t have a lot of money. People who he’s dealt with in real estate believe that he is the sole
owner of the property. The partnership
with the capitalist may have been a handshake deal, and it wasn’t known by many
people. Just before the end of the term
of the partnership, a third party proposed a massive redevelopment project for <st1:City><st1:place>New
  York City</st1:place></st1:City> to Sweat Equity. Most of the money was going to be
borrowed. Sweat Equity formed a
corporation, of which he owned 100% of the stock, to run his end of the
development. After the end of the
partnership, the capitalist finds out about this and gets really mad. Cardozo holds that Sweat Equity had a duty to
inform Capitalist of the opportunity. Cardozo said that Capitalist can have 49% of the stock of the property
for what Sweat Equity paid per share. Sweat
Equity will run the business, and Capitalist must sign the guarantee with Sweat
Equity.</p>

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Dissolution of the partnership</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Read §§ 14-38 carefully to understand dissolution. Two of the key sections are §§ 31-32. When you read them, you find a big split
between two kinds of dissolution: (1) rightful and (2) wrongful
dissolution. Fiduciary duties are very
important in either case and can cause some odd results. The first question is: can you, by contract,
create a partnership for a term that cannot be dissolved during that term? In other words, can you create a true agency
coupled with an interest that is irrevocable? No, you definitely cannot. Another way to put it is that you can’t go into court and get a
mandatory injunction forcing people to stay with the partnership if they want
to leave.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76361586"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Wrongful dissolution</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Collins v. Lewis</i> –
This case illustrates that there is such a thing as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>wrongful dissolution</i>. If
there is a wrongful dissolution, two bad things happen to the wrongdoer: (1)
the bad guy loses all of his interest in the goodwill of the business and (2)
he is subject to an action for breach of contract by the other partners. In this case, Sweat Equity met with
Capitalist with the idea of building a big new cafeteria. Sweat Equity didn’t have any money, but he
had ideas and experience. Capitalist had
a lot of money. A deal like this today
would be set up in the LLC form and it would be malpractice per se for a lawyer
not to force the actors into this form. The deal was that there was a partner’s salary for Sweat Equity because
Sweat Equity needed money to live on. The partnership agreement said that during phase one, the building, no
loss of the partnership would be allocated to Sweat Equity. That’s clearly legal and this type of
agreement is a typical way to do it. In
phase two, when the cafeteria starts running, Sweat Equity’s salary <span
class=GramE>continues,</span> while all profits are allocated to Capitalist
until he has recovered all the losses that were allocated to him in phase
one. In phase three, the partnership
salary continues, but both profits and losses are equally distributed. At that point, Sweat Equity is bearing,
indirectly, one-half of the salary to him.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Capitalist had good lawyers and a mortgage on Sweat Equity’s
partnership interest as well as many other legal protections. Capitalist got mad and wanted to dissolve the
partnership. When you read §§ 31-32, you
find that if no term is specified for a partnership, either party can get
rightful dissolution at any time. But
that “out” is not available to Capitalist. According to several <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
cases, where a definite term isn’t specified but a project is specified, there
is an implied term of years for the time needed to do the project. Another case held that where one party
theoretically can rightfully dissolve at will, fiduciary duty override applies
if dissolution would be unfair to the other partner. According to §§ 31-32, another “out” is when
the business can no longer be carried out at a profit. Under <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>
law, dissolution itself is in equity, but Capitalist joined claimed for money
damages. In <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>
and federal courts, there will usually be a jury and the jury findings on the
damage claims (at law) will be collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) on the
judge when he sits in equity.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The special issues submitted to the jury were the following:
(1) Can this business be successfully carried on at a profit? (2) If not, whose fault is it? The jury found that the business could not be
carried on at a profit and that it was Capitalist’s fault. The trial judge, based on these special
issues, entered an order that there was no ground for rightful
dissolution. The case goes to the Texas
Court of Civil Appeals, which affirms. Capitalist claims that there is no such thing as a partnership that
cannot be dissolved. But the Court of
Civil Appeals says that <span class=GramE>all the</span> trial judge held was
that there were no grounds for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rightful </i>dissolution. He could still take a stab at <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>wrongful</i> dissolution, but the jury
findings in the case will be collateral estoppel and place all fault on the
Capitalist. Capitalist would lose his
interest in the goodwill of the business and would be liable in damages to
Sweat Equity!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cauble</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Handler</i> – This is also a Texas Court
of Civil Appeals case. We have a 50-50
partnership between two partners in a profitable business. There is no partnership agreement except for
the agreement on the 50-50 split on profits and losses. One partner dies. He left all of his property to his
widow. The living partner loved the
business and wanted to keep it operating. The bank signature cards allowed either partner to sign and thus there
was no practical problem with continuing the business. What are the widow’s options at this point
given the lack of a formal partnership agreement except for the 50-50
split? Either the widow or the living
partner could force an immediate auction block sale of the partnership’s
assets. However, such sales sacrifice
value, so they are rarely used. If the
widow and living partner wanted to negotiate with the widow in the place of the
dead partner, they could do so, but the widow didn’t want to. The business could simply be continued, and
if the living partner treats the widow as a substitute for the dead partner and
vice versa, then under <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Blumer</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Brewing</i>, they will be considered 50-50
partners, with the widow taking the position of her husband.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The possibility that comes out here is that the living
partner continues the business, but the widow forces him to send out letters to
everybody saying that the dead partner is dead and that the living partner is
continuing the business. This is done
because you don’t want the widow getting sued as an apparent partner. § 31-38 contemplates this possibility. The Act says that she will not be liable as a
partner. She has a creditor’s claim on
the assets, but that claim is subordinated to the regular old creditors of the
partnership. This is true even if the
old name is continued (as is often the case with law firms). Within a reasonable time, the partnership
must pay off the widow with the value of the capital account. There are two big issues: (1) do we use book
value GAAP figures based on historical costs, or (2) do we use fair market
value figures? The court holds that in
the absence of an agreement (which would be binding under the Act), it was held
that fair market value would be used. The ruling implies that goodwill will be computed and included in the
equation because a store that has been around for a long time creates
goodwill. It may be different for
lawyers.</p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>The case is troublesome in a way. The Texas Supreme Court had a case called <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mattie <span class=SpellE>Carruth</span>
Bird</i>. She was the general partner in
a real estate limited partnership. Her
capital account had a negative balance. How could this be? If you’re
using GAAP historical cost figures and you take out a second mortgage on real
estate and then distribute the proceeds to the partners, you’ll have negative
capital account balances. That doesn’t
mean the business is in trouble. The
limited partner sued to force her executor to pay into the capital
account. The court interpreted the
Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 and Uniform Limited Partnership Act literally
and agreed with the limited partner. The
second big holding was that the executor of the deceased partner has the option
to take interest from the date of death until payoff, or if they elect to do so
in a timely matter they can get their share of profits for that period. Early on, the lawyer made the correct
election, because this was a very profitable partnership. Note that under § 38, a partnership agreement
providing for book value over two, three or four years would prevail over §§
31-38. The provisions of the Uniform
Partnership Act of 1914 are default provisions that can be trumped by an agreement
to the contrary.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Accounting is crucial. In <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cauble</i></span>,
if the original agreement had provided that the payout to the widow of the
deceased partner would have been in three or four equal annual installments
that it also would have held up. Sometimes the capital accounts are huge and there is no way the remaining
partners can have a check written quickly for the capital account. In <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Cauble</i></span>, because of the way § 38 of the Uniform Partnership
Act of 1914 reads, if the parties had agreed up-front that the widow’s profit
interest would have terminated at her husband’s death and that there would have
been no interest (or interest at a non-usurious rate) that also would have held
up.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b>Some finance overview</b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the mid-1950’s, there were seven or eight dominant Wall Street
securities firms. At that time, they
were all partnerships. Their capitalization
(by today’s standards) was amazingly small: only $25-30 million. It’s still small even when you adjust for
inflation. The big firms now have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>billions</i> in capital. But there were problems: they soon realized
that now and again even the best run brokerage goes broke. Also, among your partners, you will have some
with very large capital accounts, to the tune of several million. How do you deal with the widows of the partners
as they die? If you did nothing and went
with the UPA, the widow will get her money in a few months, just as it says in <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cauble</i></span>. First, they switched to limited partnerships
and tried to talk the widows into transferring their capital accounts to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>limited partnership status </i>at a good
fixed rate (like 9%). Then they
discovered that they had to make the same deal with retired partners. These problems also crop up in close corporations. People fail to consider the possibility that
someone will die or retire.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Within limits, you can specific when, how, and how much the
payout will be upon dissolution. But if
the sections say that something is <span class=GramE>a dissolution</span>, you
can’t specific that thing as a non-dissolving event. For example, you can’t agree that death constitutes
dissolution. It’s only half true that
you can contract to determine what dissolution is. You <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i>
specify that there will be events of dissolution in addition to what the statute
deals with.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The fiduciary duty override will sometimes conflict with
literal contract or statutory provisions and working out the conflict is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> mechanical. The RUPA deletes the provision that there is
a fiduciary duty in formation. They
still leave the fiduciary duty in operation. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, about five years
ago a statute was passed saying that there is no fiduciary duty in formation,
but there is a fiduciary duty in operation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>GAAP accounting is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>accrual</i>
accounting. If you sell something on
credit, you take in the income and you increase the capital account
immediately. In other words, you accrue
immediately. For tax purposes, any business
using an inventory must use the accrual method. What does the Internal Revenue Code provide as to professionals? For service professions, regardless of
income, you can use the cash method, that is, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>accounts receivable are neither an asset nor income until they are
collected</i>. The capital account will
not reflect unrealized receivables. If
you are on the accrual method, the capital account will reflect such
receivables. Independent CPAs will
certify statements on the cash method, but they will put legends on the
statements saying that a non-GAAP method is being used. The pure cash method is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i> a traditional GAAP method.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>All lawyers and doctors use the cash method because, from a business
standpoint, their cash flow runs far behind the provision of services. This may not always have been true,
especially with doctors. They may have
taken cash at the time of service. For
other businesses, once you reach a certain size, you must use accrual
accounting. This is mainly a matter of
the political power of lawyers and doctors. <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> passed a statute
saying that, upon dissolution, unless otherwise agreed, the amount paid out
would be book value. There arises a case
where a lawyer dies who is a partner. The partnership agreement is silent. Not only did they not use fair market value, but they cut the guy’s
widow out of his share of the unrealized receivables <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>completely</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Adams</i></st1:place><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Jarvis</i> – In this case, we have a
medical partnership on the cash method. The partnership agreement provided for what a rightful or wrongful
withdrawing partner would get: if the partner pulls out five months into the
year and has a one-fourth profit interest, then he will get his pro-rata income
for the year: 5/12 times ¼. He will also
get what is in his capital account <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at
book value</i>. Thus, the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cauble</i></span> result of fair
market value (and possibly some goodwill) is precluded. The problem is that they’re using the cash
method, and as of May 31<sup>st</sup>, there may be up to $500,000 coming in as
accounts receivable. The departing
partner could be forfeiting $125,000 by leaving early! On a very literal reading, this squares with the
first sentence of § 38. But we’re
nervous because all the parties are fiduciaries with each other, and the law
generally abhors forfeitures. All
dissolution and accounting proceedings are equity proceedings! The court says something that Shipman claims
is only half true: the partners defined this as <span class=GramE>a non</span>-dissolution
and that’s okay because § 38 allows you to do that. But the court is overreaching, according to
Shipman. If you read between the lines,
this case says that this penalty is good policy because it tends to make people
live up to their contracts. In a later
case in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>, they make
this point explicitly. The book
indicates that the situation in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
is just the opposite. <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> cases have held that any <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Adams v. Jarvis</i> clause works a partial forfeiture of property and,
as such, is per se against public policy.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Very commonly, whenever a law partner rightfully withdraws,
retires or dies, he will get a pro-rata share of that year’s income, the amount
in his capital account computed by book value, but no goodwill. The capital account payoff is often over the
course of several years. Why is it done
this way? Under Internal Revenue Code,
if the agreement provides that no part of the continued profit participation is
for goodwill, then the recipient includes that payment in income. But the good news is that the other partners
get to deduct or exclude that payment. Subchapter K is the only part of the Internal Revenue Code where you can
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>buy out</i> a business with after-tax
income. You can’t do it any other
way. As to the return of the capital
account, if, for example, it goes to a widow, the payment will be tax-free
because taxes have already been paid.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There is an old Court of Appeals of <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> case from the 1940’s in the corporate context
involving the question of whether at-will employees, while on the company
payroll, may use company time and resources to entice clients away after they
leave. One of the big mid-level ad
agencies in <st1:City><st1:place>New York City</st1:place></st1:City> was
incorporated. It was started by the old
man, who, at his best, was superb. But
he was getting older and losing it. The
top people under <span class=GramE>him</span> who were all at-will employees,
thought they had worked out an arrangement by which they would purchase the old
man’s stock and he would retire. But
there was a real business problem here: at the last minute, the old man refused
to sign. Without informing him or
getting his consent, they plotted a walkout day. They set up a new shop on company time while
drawing company paychecks and solicited clients. They walked out, taking a lot of clients with
them. The old corporation and the old
man sued under agency and corporate law saying that these people had violated
their duty of loyalty, duty of care, and duty of full and fair disclosure
up-front to the company and the old man. The court answered that it was still the majority rule in the corporate
world that the at-will employees could not participate in this type of
activity.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Meehan v. <span
class=SpellE>Shaughnessy</span></i> – This is an unusual partnership agreement
in that it lumps rightful and wrongful dissolution together and provides what
is going to happen. The court looks at
the agreement and basically ratifies the agreement. It sees no conflict between the agreement and
the UPA. In this case, some of the partners
went to young associates and solicited business for their new firm. They held that the old per se rule of setting
up shop while being employed didn’t apply to a law firm because at a law firm
the main parties to be protected are the clients, and the clients can’t get
good service unless there is work up front. The court found a violation, holding that the old partners had a right
to have their solicitation sent to the clients at the same time that the
departing partners sent theirs. Note
that you can’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>forcibly</i> take clients
with you.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>8182 Maryland
Associates, Limited Partnership v. Sheehan</i> – In <st1:City><st1:place>Kansas
  City</st1:place></st1:City> around 1984, we have a fast-growing mid-sized law
firm. One of the lawyers did financial
work. They saw growth in the area and
decided to sign a long term lease under the “last erection” principle, which
comes from the S &amp; L crisis of the early 1980’s. You could tell that an S &amp; L was going
out of business when they spent hundreds of millions to build new
skyscrapers. So the partnership signed a
long term lease. This was a general
partnership; the case shows the dangers of not using an LLC or corporation. Acceleration clauses in these documents, at
least in non-consumer leases, are fully valid. The <span class=SpellE>lessors</span> will hire good lawyers to put “good”
acceleration clauses in. What
happened? Legal business was great for a
while in the 1980’s, <span class=GramE>then</span> it turned sour in the late
1980’s for about four years. When that
lawyer left, what was the effect on the dissolution of the firm? The UPA tells us that the firm continues
until winding up occurs. In a contracts
sense, that will mean that all contracts that were on the books are paid
for. The court holds that the rising
star guy is liable! Don’t use general
partnership or LLP? Some states have the
broad form LLP that covers contract as well as torts, but most states have <span
class=SpellE>LLPs</span> that don’t cover contracts or embezzlement. An action for embezzlement can be pleaded as
tort or contract. The <span
class=SpellE>lessor</span> failed to ratify or adopt in this case.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What happens when there is a joint judgment against all
those partners plus the partnership? In
the case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wayne Smith</i> from the Ohio
Supreme Court, it is held that where there is joint liability in contract, you
must first try to get satisfaction at the partnership level, meaning that your
suit is both against the partnership and all partners, because if you omit one partner
you can’t go back later and get ‘<span class=SpellE>em</span>. In tort, you can move “sequentially”. Later, it was held that when you go to the
two 50% partners, the creditor should <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>try</i>
to get 50% from each, but if one is a turnip, then after trying to divide it
50-50, you can get 100% from the other. We’re
into guaranty and surety again. If you
are a creditor of a partnership and you let one partner off, some cases will
hold that you have released everyone. Furthermore, if the partnership has to pay something by June 1<sup>st</sup>
and you get that date pass without suing them, then in many states the partner
who has ditched is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>released</i> under
surety and guaranty law. If there are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>former</i> partners you want to reach, <span
class=GramE>then</span> before you extend the due date of the partnership, get
all twelve partners to consent. Otherwise, if you extend as to the four that you will try to reach on
surety grounds then you will screw up.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Along the same lines, there was a big case from the 1960’s
from the California Court of Appeals dealing with tort liability. There was a general partnership for the
practice of law. Smith was a general
partner. While he was a partner, Jones,
another partner, brought a personal injury client in. Smith did not know about it. After he left, Jones mishandled the case and
let the statute of limitations run. The
client sues the partnership, current partners, and Smith, the retired
partner. Smith says he wants out! He argues that the old firm was dissolved and
the negligence occurred after he left. The UPA tells us that the old firm continues until <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>winding up</i>, and for a tort client, that’s not until you’ve
completely finished a case, which may be 10-12 years later!</p>

<p>How do you protect yourself on torts if you’re a retiring partner? The firm today is usually an LLP. If you didn’t bring the client in and you
didn’t supervise or screw up, you’ll have a defense under the LLP statutes. The other thing that you do is in the
retirement agreement with the firm you get the firm to agree to have the
malpractice policy cover not only current partners and employees but former partners
and employees too. If the firm won’t do
it and it’s not an LLP, go buy yourself tail coverage. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
a limited partnership can make an LLP election, in which case the general partner
of the limited partnership has some shield against tort liability, though it’s
not worth a lot. The job of the general
partner of a limited partnership is to supervise and manage. Don’t be an individual general partner of a limited
partnership: form an LLC or a corporation.</p>

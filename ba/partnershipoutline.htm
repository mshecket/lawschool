style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general </i>partnership?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here’s the definition: A <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>general partnership </i>is one in which <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all</i> partners are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general </i>partners.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The emphasis here is on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>general</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under UPA §§ 1-18,
plus 40, there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>joint and several
liability</i> on the part of all partners for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>tort</i> debts of the general partnership, and there is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>joint</i> liability for all of the partners’
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>contract </i>debts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you read §§ 18 and 40 and put them
together, you will find that you can sue not only the partnership for the
assets it has, but if it doesn’t have enough, you can go after the individual
partners and reach their personal estates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Ouch!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s called the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>disadvantage of unlimited personal liability</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a big disadvantage…how come?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one with any sense advertently forms a
general partnership today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For a lawyer
to recommend it is malpractice <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>per se</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’ll
find at the end of the course that in the last 25 years, the LLC has arrived
and the Ohio LLC statute, O.R.C. § 1705, is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>excellent</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The LLC, with proper drafting, will give the
tax advantages of a general partnership with the limited liability advantage of
a corporation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what is the great tax advantage of general
partnerships?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Corporations in this
country historically have been subject to a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>double
tax</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s been modified a lot in the
last 45 years, but big portions of it still remain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is because a corporation is considered
as a full-fledged legal entity separate from the shareholders for tax and other
purposes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As such, historically, the
corporation was subject to tax on what it earned, and then, when it paid
dividends, the dividends were fully taxable again to the shareholder
recipients.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By the end of today, we’ll
see that there have been two ameliorations of that, though to some extent it’s
still true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The U.S. Supreme Court
upheld the ability of Congress to do this even before the Sixteenth Amendment
was passed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was said that the
government bestows the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>privilege</i> upon
people to set up an entity with limited liability, and thus Congress can levy a
tax on that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>privilege</i>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A general partnership, because it has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>three strong non-resemblances to a corporation</i>, is not subject to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>income </i>taxes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The emphasis is on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>income</i> taxes, because a general partnership is subject to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>excise </i>taxes, it must withhold taxes on
salaries of employees, it is subject to sales taxes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>but</i> it isn’t subject to income taxes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How has Congress treated general partnerships
since 1913?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They have said that, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in general</i>, with some exceptions to
follow later, the partnership is considered a non-entity for income tax
purposes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The income and losses of the
partnership <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>flow through</i> to the
individual partners and is taxed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>to them</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>However</i>,
by statute, the partnership must file <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>information</i>
returns with the IRS.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those information
returns enable the IRS to collect from the partners.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>employees</i> of
the partnership, they’re just like corporate employees.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The partnership must pay and withhold Social
Security tax.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Partners pay taxes just
like sole proprietors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each quarter,
they must file a declaration of estimated taxes for the year and pay one-fourth
of it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When they file their final
return, they “settle up”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they paid
too much, they’ll get a refund, and if they paid too little, they’ll have to
write another check to the IRS.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Until
1960, general partnerships were very popular in the service areas, for example,
law, accounting, medicine, dentistry, and engineering.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is because there was no double taxation,
and state statutes as to law, doctors, dentists and accountants provided that
those professions had to practice as sole proprietors or general partnerships
to expose to the world not only the assets the partnership owned, but also the
personal property of the partners individually.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Congress discerned that there were three significant
non-corporate attributes of a general partnership:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Personal
liability </i>of all of the partners for the debts of the partnership in
addition to the partnership itself being liable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) §§ 18-32 of the UPA 1914 introduce us to
the idea that a general partnership is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>easily
dissolved</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dissolution is defined
specially in the UPA as a “change in legal relationship among the
partners”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The death, retirement, or
bankruptcy of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> general partner
causes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dissolution</i> of the
partnership, but not the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>death</i> of the
partnership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The party <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>leaving</i> the partnership by death,
retirement, or bankruptcy is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entitled </i>to
the amount credited to her capital account <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>soon</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Compare this to the situation of Jones Retail
Store, Inc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It has four siblings working
in the store.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Upon the death of one of
the Jones siblings, there is no dissolution, meaning that the widow of the
dying Jones sibling <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cannot</i> get the
fair value of the shares from the company <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unless
</i>there is a specific contractual provision to the contrary.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s just the opposite from a general
partnership because the death, retirement, bankruptcy, or insanity of one or
more shareholders of a corporation does <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>
affect the ongoing life of the corporation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The corollary to that is that the same is true even if one or more or
all of the shareholders assign all of their shares to somebody else.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, the corporation is guaranteed by law to
have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perpetual life</i>!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Whereas with the general
partnership, death, retirement, bankruptcy or insanity cause dissolution.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The guy who went crazy can withdraw his whole
capital account.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(3) With a corporation,
unless there are valid reasonable restraints on alienation, any or all
shareholders can sell any or all of their shares to anyone for any reason <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at any time</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Needless to say, even the closely held
corporation with a few shareholders is set up in such a way to sell its shares
to the public if the public wants it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The general partnership, on the other hand, is set up for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-public ownership</i>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These three differences led Congress to say that a general
partnership doesn’t resemble a corporation very much.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we get to the LLC, clever drafters at
the state level came up with a new animal from civil law countries like <st1:country-region><st1:place>Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>:
the LLC, which had limited liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Clinton Administration was persuaded that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>most </i>unincorporated business associations, if they “checked the
box” on their first return saying that they wanted to be treated as a general
partnership for tax purposes, then they’ll be treated that way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Subchapter K is the subchapter of the
internal revenue code that deals with partnerships.)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will primarily be studying the Uniform Partnership Act of
1914.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The book has many references to
the Revised Uniform Partnership Act of the last 15 years.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Revised Act has notes that are very good
research tools; so does the original.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
<st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, our Act is close to the old
one with one <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>maddening</i> change: the
numbers in the O.R.C. are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one off!</i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Partnerships and <span class=SpellE>LLCs</span>
are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deep <span class=SpellE>jello</span></i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Your client can get screwed very, very
fast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We will make analogies to
corporations, which Shipman proposes are much more logical.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just what is a partnership?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Read §§ 1-8 and you get the picture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Partnership is created when there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>co-ownership
of a business for profit</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re
in the not-for-profit realm, look at R.C. Chapter 1702 and go to a
not-for-profit corporation!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Never use
unincorporated business forms for a not-for-profit association!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, the definition of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>business</i> in the cases is broad.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
cases in the last thirty years have applied the statute to lottery tickets, for
example.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jack says to Jill: “I’m going
to buy some lottery tickets with this number.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jill says: “Buy one for me too.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He buys two $5 tickets, and they win!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jill, in most states, can assert partnership law and get half of what
those two tickets are worth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
addition, in a <st1:State><st1:place>Mississippi</st1:place></st1:State> case
after World War II, a brother wanted to engage in a business operation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His sister sent him some money that looked
like a loan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The operation took off like
gangbusters, and it was held that the brother and sister were 50-50 partners
and the brother had to split with the sister.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If there had been a big tort liability, the sister would have argued
that opposite: that she was a mere creditor.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Partnerships come in two flavors: today and tomorrow we will
discuss <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>advertent</i> partnerships.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On Wednesday, we’ll talk about <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inadvertent</i> partnerships.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is malpractice for a lawyer to recommend a
plain vanilla UPA general partnership today!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Use the LLC or a corporation!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
aren’t a lot of law firms set up as <span class=SpellE>LLPs</span>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those are general partnerships with some limitation
of tort liability but no limitation of tort liability.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s just wrong and bad!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They should be <span class=SpellE>LLCs</span>
instead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But don’t worry unless you’re
going to become a partner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no
such thing as an inadvertent LLC or corporation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Richert</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. <span class=SpellE>Handly</span> </i>–
How does the statute of frauds apply to partnerships?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A famous <st1:City><st1:place>Houston</st1:place></st1:City>
lawyer got out of the issue on the basis of the statute of frauds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it involves real estate, here in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
we have strong partial performance doctrines that may well override a lot of
the authority other places.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:2'><a name="_Toc76361581"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Assumed name statutes</b></a><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are doing business under an assumed name, you are
supposed to file an assumed name certificate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As to a partnership, the statute is especially demanding in that if you
are a partnership and the firm name contains less than all of the names of all
of the partners, the county recorder is not to accept real estate documents
unless there is an assumed name certificate filed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the firm name is Smith &amp; Jones and
there is only Smith and only Jones, you’re okay.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if you’re in Baker &amp; Hostetler, there
are a lot more partners than just Baker or Hostetler.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Partnership property can still be partnership property even
if it’s in the name of one of the partners.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You don’t want to run a partnership that way; you want to put
partnership property in the partnership name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Before the Uniform Partnership Act of 1914, partnership property had to
be held in a <span class=SpellE>cotenancy</span> by partnership.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 says you
can clearly hold partnership property in the partnership name.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Common name statutes in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and most states say that if you’re suing a partnership simply to bind the
partnership assets, the statute will come to your aid if it’s not a very big deal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Likewise, a partnership can use the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
common name statute to sue with just one signature: that of the managing
partner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s true in most American
states, though it’s not so in three or four states.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do partnerships ever issue stock certificates
or anything similar?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, it’s the
partnership agreement that governs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are no stock certificates.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a Paul Bunyan at the bar, and a capitalist comes
up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He just bought a timber-cutting
agreement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He says: “Let’s chop some
wood!”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bunyan asks: “How much timber is
there?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bunyan looks, comes back and
says: “You’re 30% too high.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But they
agree anyhow, explicitly agreeing on a 50-50 profit split.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They also explicitly agree that sweat equity
(Bunyan) was to use his tractor and other equipment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was to be paid “above the line”, that is,
before computation of net loss, and he was to be reimbursed for the use of his
tractor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nothing was said about interest
about capital, meaning that there shall be no interest on capital.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nothing was said about the partner’s salary.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Was this agreement void because it was not in writing?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, because it was fully performed
already.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A general partnership was
created.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The timber was cut and
sold.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each party had a capital
account.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The capital account goes up by
the assets you contribute and by your share of the net profits.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It goes down by your share of the net
losses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was a partnership for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one transaction</i>: the timber under the
timber lease.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tax return was
prepared by a CPA, who gave copies to both parties.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The partnership agreement may be subject to
amendment by conduct, including how the tax return is prepared.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Either partner can sign, but the others are
entitled to a copy of the return and a statement of their distributive share of
all items.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The CPA computed the return
and found that overall there had been a loss and that the loss is allocable
50-50 between the partners.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Clearly, the
profits were to be divided equally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
CPA, in effect, said that there was a negative balance in the capital account
of Sweat Equity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The purpose of the
partnership was completed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was <span
class=GramE>a dissolution</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With a
general partnership, very often you have to use the traditional method of
accounting to settle up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a
major Ohio Supreme Court case from the 1980’s and a major <st1:State><st1:place>Arizona</st1:place></st1:State>
case from the 1970’s to the contrary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Accounting is always <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in equity</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The partnership and all partners are
parties.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most often, the cost of the
accounting is borne by the partnership itself.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What was the problem?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Bunyan thought that the deal that had been cut was “profits: 50-50 and
losses: 100-0”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could that deal have
explicitly been made as between the parties up-front?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sure, under § 18, which merely gives you
default rules.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the parties <i

<p class=MsoNormal>Many law firms have a “draw” against profits.<span

can periodically draw out about half of what the firm estimates will be the
profits for the year.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that if the
draw against profits is greater than what the profits turn out to be, the
partner will get a note from the senior partner asking for his check within ten

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>less</i>, as it usually is, within about two
weeks after the end of the year, the partner will get the difference from the
firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cautious law firms never borrow
money to pay partners’ draws.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With one
big law firm in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>, there
is no payment during the year.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They wait
until January, and then write a check.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>During the year, the partners must write checks for estimated tax, and

up the H.R. 10 plan for the self-employed and encourage partners to contribute

Here we have different facts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This case
cites an earlier case of the Oregon Supreme Court, <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Croisant</i></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The partnership here was an accounting
partnership. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>One of the partnership’s
clients was a wealthy businesswoman who planned to go to <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>
for three months.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She went to the
partner that she usually dealt with and told him that she would put his
signature on her bank account.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
wanted him to pay her bills while she was out of the country.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This conference was entered on the time
records of the firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The firm billed her
for the work that the partner did.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
came back from <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and, at first, everything seemed
okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had paid all of her legitimate
bills.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Later, however, she found out
that the partner had paid the expenses of her husband’s lover while she was
gone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was very mad!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The partner died, either by suicide or an
accident.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She clearly had a cause of
action against his estate, but the CPA firm itself was much more inviting.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The CPA firm would have had a general
liability policy and a malpractice policy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Both of these policies probably excluded anything dishonest, criminal,
malicious, or intentional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the firm
was big enough that the assets of the firm plus the personal assets of all the
partners were large enough to support a judgment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that this came years before the
LLP.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court held that the partner’s
actions <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were</i> in the normal course of
business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What should the lady have
done?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She should have required the
signature of both her CPA firm and her lawyer for checks while she was gone.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The facts of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roach</i>
itself are as follows: there was a two person general partnership long before
there were <span class=SpellE>LLPs</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One of the partners did some real estate speculation on his own and lost
his shirt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of his clients who he
serviced was rich and the lawyer hit him up for a personal loan.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The check was made out to the partner in his
personal name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The loan was never
repaid, and that partner is judgment-proof.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The client gets a different lawyer, of course.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could the client sue the one lawyer alone and
get his partnership interest?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No,
because §§ 15-38 of the Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 state that an
individual creditor of a partner can levy upon the partnership interest, which
allows a kind of weird remedy: a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charging
order</i> on his earnings from the partnership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shipman thinks this would include both a guaranteed salary and a share
of profits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He’s pretty sure that the
restrictions on wage garnishment would not apply because a partner’s earnings
or salary are not wages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
different than a share of stock: you can’t cause the interest to be paid over
and cause <span class=GramE>a dissolution</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, the other partner or partners
can redeem the partner’s interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shipman says that it’s not a great remedy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Partnership or LLC interest is basically not
good collateral.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lawyer sued the partnership under §§ 1-18 and 40 saying
that there was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>negligence</i> in what the
partner did, and that the negligence led to the client’s loss.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He served both partners individually as well
as the law firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He claimed that the
partnership itself was liable as was the innocent partner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Negligence was used to dig into the
malpractice policy of the law firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
claimed that what the lawyer did was negligence only.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What rules of professional ethics were
violated?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Canon 5 and the rules <span
class=SpellE>thereunder</span> tell us that one of the stupidest things a
lawyer can do is enter into personal or financial relationships with clients.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is clear that a lawyer must give all kinds
of warnings of the dangers of a personal loan to the client.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here, the lawyer did not inform the client
that he ought to insist on a first mortgage on the lawyer’s house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The rule is even stricter with trustees.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court holds that the partnership and the
other partner are on the hook.<o:p></o:p></p>

will be held liable just like any other general partner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many lawyers in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
will tell the bank if it wants to levy on a general partnership interest that
it may well have the same liability for the partnership debts and obligations
as their debtor has.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The law is not
clear on this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was there any tax impact

person contributing property has his capital account credited for the fair
market value of the property and if Sweat Equity doesn’t receive an addition to
his capital account because of services, then the transaction will be tax-free.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over 12-15 years there were rocky times, but Sweat Equity

</span>People who he’s dealt with in real estate believe that he is the sole

corporation, of which he owned 100% of the stock, to run his end of the
development.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the end of the
partnership, the capitalist finds out about this and gets really mad.<span

there is a wrongful dissolution, two bad things happen to the wrongdoer: (1)
the bad guy loses all of his interest in the goodwill of the business and (2)
he is subject to an action for breach of contract by the other partners.<span

Capitalist with the idea of building a big new cafeteria.<span

had ideas and experience.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Capitalist had
a lot of money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A deal like this today
would be set up in the LLC form and it would be malpractice per se for a lawyer
not to force the actors into this form.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The deal was that there was a partner’s salary for Sweat Equity because
Sweat Equity needed money to live on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The partnership agreement said that during phase one, the building, no
loss of the partnership would be allocated to Sweat Equity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s clearly legal and this type of
agreement is a typical way to do it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
phase two, when the cafeteria starts running, Sweat Equity’s salary <span
class=GramE>continues,</span> while all profits are allocated to Capitalist
until he has recovered all the losses that were allocated to him in phase
one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In phase three, the partnership
salary continues, but both profits and losses are equally distributed.<span

find that if no term is specified for a partnership, either party can get
rightful dissolution at any time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
that “out” is not available to Capitalist.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>According to several <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
cases, where a definite term isn’t specified but a project is specified, there
is an implied term of years for the time needed to do the project.<span

theoretically can rightfully dissolve at will, fiduciary duty override applies
if dissolution would be unfair to the other partner.<span

the business can no longer be carried out at a profit.<span

widow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The living partner loved the
business and wanted to keep it operating.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The bank signature cards allowed either partner to sign and thus there
was no practical problem with continuing the business.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What are the widow’s options at this point
given the lack of a formal partnership agreement except for the 50-50
split?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Either the widow or the living
partner could force an immediate auction block sale of the partnership’s
assets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, such sales sacrifice
value, so they are rarely used.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
widow and living partner wanted to negotiate with the widow in the place of the
dead partner, they could do so, but the widow didn’t want to.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The business could simply be continued, and
if the living partner treats the widow as a substitute for the dead partner and
vice versa, then under <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Blumer</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Brewing</i>, they will be considered 50-50
partners, with the widow taking the position of her husband.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The possibility that comes out here is that the living
partner continues the business, but the widow forces him to send out letters to
everybody saying that the dead partner is dead and that the living partner is
continuing the business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is done
because you don’t want the widow getting sued as an apparent partner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§ 31-38 contemplates this possibility.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Act says that she will not be liable as a
partner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She has a creditor’s claim on
the assets, but that claim is subordinated to the regular old creditors of the
partnership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is true even if the
old name is continued (as is often the case with law firms).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Within a reasonable time, the partnership
must pay off the widow with the value of the capital account.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are two big issues: (1) do we use book
value GAAP figures based on historical costs, or (2) do we use fair market
value figures?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court holds that in
the absence of an agreement (which would be binding under the Act), it was held
that fair market value would be used.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The ruling implies that goodwill will be computed and included in the
equation because a store that has been around for a long time creates
goodwill.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It may be different for
lawyers.<o:p></o:p></p>

</span>How could this be?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re
using GAAP historical cost figures and you take out a second mortgage on real
estate and then distribute the proceeds to the partners, you’ll have negative
capital account balances.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That doesn’t
mean the business is in trouble.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
limited partner sued to force her executor to pay into the capital
account.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court interpreted the
Uniform Partnership Act of 1914 and Uniform Limited Partnership Act literally
and agreed with the limited partner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
second big holding was that the executor of the deceased partner has the option
to take interest from the date of death until payoff, or if they elect to do so
in a timely matter they can get their share of profits for that period.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Early on, the lawyer made the correct
election, because this was a very profitable partnership.<span

providing for book value over two, three or four years would prevail over §§
31-38.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The provisions of the Uniform

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Some finance overview</b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the mid-1950’s, there were seven or eight dominant Wall Street
securities firms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that time, they
were all partnerships.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their capitalization
(by today’s standards) was amazingly small: only $25-30 million.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s still small even when you adjust for
inflation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The big firms now have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>billions</i> in capital.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there were problems: they soon realized
that now and again even the best run brokerage goes broke.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, among your partners, you will have some
with very large capital accounts, to the tune of several million.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do you deal with the widows of the partners
as they die?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you did nothing and went
with the UPA, the widow will get her money in a few months, just as it says in <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cauble</i></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First, they switched to limited partnerships
and tried to talk the widows into transferring their capital accounts to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>limited partnership status </i>at a good
fixed rate (like 9%).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then they
discovered that they had to make the same deal with retired partners.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These problems also crop up in close corporations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People fail to consider the possibility that
someone will die or retire.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within limits, you can specific when, how, and how much the
payout will be upon dissolution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if
the sections say that something is <span class=GramE>a dissolution</span>, you
can’t specific that thing as a non-dissolving event.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, you can’t agree that death constitutes
dissolution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s only half true that
you can contract to determine what dissolution is.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i>
specify that there will be events of dissolution in addition to what the statute
deals with.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fiduciary duty override will sometimes conflict with
literal contract or statutory provisions and working out the conflict is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> mechanical.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The RUPA deletes the provision that there is
a fiduciary duty in formation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
still leave the fiduciary duty in operation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, about five years
ago a statute was passed saying that there is no fiduciary duty in formation,
but there is a fiduciary duty in operation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GAAP accounting is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>accrual</i>
accounting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you sell something on
credit, you take in the income and you increase the capital account
immediately.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, you accrue
immediately.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For tax purposes, any business
using an inventory must use the accrual method.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What does the Internal Revenue Code provide as to professionals?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For service professions, regardless of
income, you can use the cash method, that is, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>accounts receivable are neither an asset nor income until they are
collected</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The capital account will
not reflect unrealized receivables.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
you are on the accrual method, the capital account will reflect such
receivables.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Independent CPAs will
certify statements on the cash method, but they will put legends on the
statements saying that a non-GAAP method is being used.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The pure cash method is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not</i> a traditional GAAP method.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All lawyers and doctors use the cash method because, from a business
standpoint, their cash flow runs far behind the provision of services.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This may not always have been true,
especially with doctors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They may have
taken cash at the time of service.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
other businesses, once you reach a certain size, you must use accrual
accounting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is mainly a matter of
the political power of lawyers and doctors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State> passed a statute
saying that, upon dissolution, unless otherwise agreed, the amount paid out
would be book value.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There arises a case
where a lawyer dies who is a partner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The partnership agreement is silent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Not only did they not use fair market value, but they cut the guy’s

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Jarvis</i> – In this case, we have a
medical partnership on the cash method.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The partnership agreement provided for what a rightful or wrongful
withdrawing partner would get: if the partner pulls out five months into the
year and has a one-fourth profit interest, then he will get his pro-rata income
for the year: 5/12 times ¼.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He will also
get what is in his capital account <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at
book value</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cauble</i></span> result of fair
market value (and possibly some goodwill) is precluded.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The problem is that they’re using the cash
method, and as of May 31<sup>st</sup>, there may be up to $500,000 coming in as
accounts receivable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The departing
partner could be forfeiting $125,000 by leaving early!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On a very literal reading, this squares with the
first sentence of § 38.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we’re
nervous because all the parties are fiduciaries with each other, and the law
generally abhors forfeitures.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All
dissolution and accounting proceedings are equity proceedings!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court says something that Shipman claims
is only half true: the partners defined this as <span class=GramE>a non</span>-dissolution
and that’s okay because § 38 allows you to do that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the court is overreaching, according to
Shipman.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you read between the lines,
this case says that this penalty is good policy because it tends to make people
live up to their contracts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a later
case in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>, they make
this point explicitly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The book
indicates that the situation in <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
is just the opposite.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> cases have held that any <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

as such, is per se against public policy.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Very commonly, whenever a law partner rightfully withdraws,
retires or dies, he will get a pro-rata share of that year’s income, the amount
in his capital account computed by book value, but no goodwill.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The capital account payoff is often over the
course of several years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is it done
this way?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under Internal Revenue Code,
if the agreement provides that no part of the continued profit participation is
for goodwill, then the recipient includes that payment in income.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the good news is that the other partners
get to deduct or exclude that payment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Subchapter K is the only part of the Internal Revenue Code where you can
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>buy out</i> a business with after-tax
income.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can’t do it any other
way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As to the return of the capital
account, if, for example, it goes to a widow, the payment will be tax-free
because taxes have already been paid.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is an old Court of Appeals of <st1:State><st1:place>New

leave.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the big mid-level ad
agencies in <st1:City><st1:place>New York City</st1:place></st1:City> was

man, who, at his best, was superb.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
he was getting older and losing it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
top people under <span class=GramE>him</span> who were all at-will employees,
thought they had worked out an arrangement by which they would purchase the old
man’s stock and he would retire.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
there was a real business problem here: at the last minute, the old man refused
to sign.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Without informing him or
getting his consent, they plotted a walkout day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They set up a new shop on company time while
drawing company paychecks and solicited clients.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They walked out, taking a lot of clients with
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The old corporation and the old
man sued under agency and corporate law saying that these people had violated
their duty of loyalty, duty of care, and duty of full and fair disclosure
up-front to the company and the old man.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The court answered that it was still the majority rule in the corporate
world that the at-will employees could not participate in this type of
activity.<o:p></o:p></p>

the agreement and basically ratifies the agreement.<span

the UPA.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this case, some of the partners

the main parties to be protected are the clients, and the clients can’t get
good service unless there is work up front.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal>What happens when there is a joint judgment against all
those partners plus the partnership?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
the case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wayne Smith</i> from the Ohio
Supreme Court, it is held that where there is joint liability in contract, you
must first try to get satisfaction at the partnership level, meaning that your
suit is both against the partnership and all partners, because if you omit one partner
you can’t go back later and get ‘<span class=SpellE>em</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In tort, you can move “sequentially”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Later, it was held that when you go to the
two 50% partners, the creditor should <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>try</i>
to get 50% from each, but if one is a turnip, then after trying to divide it
50-50, you can get 100% from the other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’re
into guaranty and surety again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you
are a creditor of a partnership and you let one partner off, some cases will
hold that you have released everyone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Furthermore, if the partnership has to pay something by June 1<sup>st</sup>
and you get that date pass without suing them, then in many states the partner
who has ditched is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>released</i> under
surety and guaranty law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>former</i> partners you want to reach, <span

all twelve partners to consent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

surety grounds then you will screw up.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Along the same lines, there was a big case from the 1960’s
from the California Court of Appeals dealing with tort liability.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a general partnership for the
practice of law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Smith was a general
partner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While he was a partner, Jones,
another partner, brought a personal injury client in.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Smith did not know about it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After he left, Jones mishandled the case and
let the statute of limitations run.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
client sues the partnership, current partners, and Smith, the retired
partner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Smith says he wants out!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He argues that the old firm was dissolved and
the negligence occurred after he left.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The UPA tells us that the old firm continues until <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

completely finished a case, which may be 10-12 years later!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do you protect yourself on torts if you’re a retiring partner?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The firm today is usually an LLP.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you didn’t bring the client in and you
didn’t supervise or screw up, you’ll have a defense under the LLP statutes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other thing that you do is in the
retirement agreement with the firm you get the firm to agree to have the
malpractice policy cover not only current partners and employees but former partners
and employees too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the firm won’t do
it and it’s not an LLP, go buy yourself tail coverage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
a limited partnership can make an LLP election, in which case the general partner
of the limited partnership has some shield against tort liability, though it’s
not worth a lot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The job of the general
partner of a limited partnership is to supervise and manage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don’t be an individual general partner of a limited
partnership: form an LLC or a corporation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p><span>Here
come two white books containing some </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> corporate statutes. They include §§ 1701, 1702, 1704, 1705, 1775,
and 1782. These materials have been
furnished by this big financial printer. These materials are required for the course. We <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must</i> bring them to the exam. “Make these statutes your friend during the
course!”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Business (or for-profit) corporations</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, these are governed
primarily by § 1701. Let’s start with
some crucial terminology and classification. Who are the members of the “corporate family”? What do they do? How are they governed? How are they taxed? We will do a lot of tax issue-spotting in
this course because taxation has huge effects in this area of law.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The corporate family tree</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Investors </span></i><span>are people who invest money
in the corporation. “Money to a corporation
is like blood to humans: without it, you die.” <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Creditors </i>(e.g. owners of company
bonds) take first upon <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dissolution</i>. Dissolution has a different context in a
corporate situation than in a partnership situation: it means <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>termination of legal existence</i>. Creditors take first, and if there’s anything
left, then the equity investors take what’s left.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Where
does the term “equity” in “equity investor” come from? <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It comes from the law of mortgage. Debtors would secure a loan by giving
creditors a deed that is absolute on its face. Needless to say, some creditors applied very unfair procedures, and in response,
the debtors went to the courts of equity (</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> having two different sets
of courts), and the law courts basically laughed in their faces. But the equity courts, which had their roots
in the Church, created the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equity of
redemption</i>. If the debtor has paid
off all of the loan and the interest, the equity court will enter an order of specific
performance on the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>person </i>of the
creditor forcing him to return the deed to the debtor. That is, you have an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>equity of redemption</i>. In
modern mortgage practice, 60% of that procedure is still in place. A foreclosure of a mortgage is always a
proceeding <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in equity</i>. Not only do you draw upon equity precedent,
but if it is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purely</i> in equity, there
is no jury trial, and that’s really important.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>All
investors other than creditors are thus called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>equity investors</i>. <span
class=GramE>A prime example of this classification are</span> owners of common
stock. Another example is owners of
preferred stock. That is an equity
investment too, but upon dissolution, a preferred stock owner takes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>after</i> creditors but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>before</i> common stock. There
are a number of different “flavors” of equity investors. We will study a little bit about options on
equity in this course, primarily options on common stock. Options are used primarily in the context of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>executive stock options</i>, which we’ll
study closely. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>But</i>, the term has a broader application. A <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>warrant</i>
is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>long-term </i>option that is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>transferable</i>. For a few companies in this country, there
are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perpetual warrants</i> out there that
are occasionally traded on the stock exchange. Executive stock options are nearly always <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>non-transferable</i>, with one exception. If you die, your beneficiaries get the option
and usually will have the opportunity to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exercise</i>
the option if they want to.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Voting</span></i><span> stockholders elect the
directors. Are there non-voting classes
of stock? Yes, in most states, including
both </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. There can be entire classes of stock that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do not vote</i>. For example, say a family company is going
public in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The family that owns the company might
restructure the company so that the family takes “Class A” common stock, which
has voting rights, while the public is sold “Class B” common stock, which is
just like “Class A” stock except that it does not allow voting rights. The family would try to establish a
dynasty. Consider that both the
Washington Post and the New York Times are set up this way: the founding
families have voting stock while the public has non-voting stock.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
will this go over well in trying to sell the “Class B” stock to the
public? It’s problematic. Academic studies show that if you run things
this way, there is going to be an 8-10% discount from what you could get if you
sold the public voting stock, thus <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>potentially</i>
passing voting control to the public. Why
the discount, though? One theoretical
way for a shareholder in a public company to make out very well is for there to
be a takeover at a bigger company at a substantial premium, like 25-35% over
market price. If the founding family
owns all of the voting stock, is there going to ever be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>hostile</i> takeover? No,
never. There will also be fewer
supplicants for a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>friendly</i> takeover.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Furthermore,
a number of the voting securities broker-dealers will refuse to handle the sale
of non-voting stock. You can always find
someone who will, though, but you might have to pay them more. The reason some broker-dealers won’t take on
an IPO of non-voting stock is that “you sell the sizzle, not the steak”. If the broker-dealer can’t sell all the stock
in the new company, then they have to “eat” it. They just have to hold on to the stock they can’t sell in the IPO until
they can find enough buyers. The
financial markets go as much by “sizzle” as by rationality, according to
Shipman.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>directors</i> have several jobs. The most important one is the hiring and
firing of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>officers</i>. Officers are very high-level management employees
with a formal legal title: “executive vice president” or whatever. The other roles of the directors are to pass major
transactions, to monitor the officers, and to set long-range plans and policies. The directors are advised by lawyers, CPAs,
management consultants, and investment bankers. They are not expected to be super-experts in all those areas, or even be
super-experts in what the company does. Warren <span class=SpellE>Buffett</span> is a director of Coca-Cola, but
he doesn’t know anything about how to run a bottling operation. However, he does know how to pick out people
who <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do </i>know how to run bottling
operations. Those <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>officers</i> are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agents</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Agency</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span>Agency</span></i><span> is a legal relationship
that is crucial to any common law legal system because most of the work in the
world is done by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agents</i> working for
their <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i>. Is the law of agency limited to business
transactions? No way! It covers both personal activities <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> business activities. It’s another “AC/DC”. In order to have an agency relationship, do
you need to have a contract or consideration or both? No way!!! Very often, there <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> a contract
and consideration. Take, for example,
Joe Smith running a hamburger joint as a sole proprietor. He hires Mr. Jones under a signed, written
two year contract as general manager of “Hamburger Joint Unlimited”. It’s a valid contract. There’s consideration on both sides. That’s an example of where there <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>would</i> be a contract and consideration.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
very often in the personal area, and even in other areas, there is no contract
or consideration. Let’s say it’s
Thanksgiving and a student comes home from college to be with her family. It’s the day before, and her father is
cooking the turkey, and he is missing a certain ingredient. He says: “Hey daughter! Drive to the 7-11 and get Item X!” Then he gives her $20. She gets in the <span class=GramE>car,</span>
and on the way to 7-11 she’s negligent and she kills a neurosurgeon making $2
million a year. The neurosurgeon was not
negligent at all. Can we say that she
was negligently entrusted? No! She’s usually a good driver! The father has not only a $300,000 auto
policy, but also a $2,000,000 umbrella policy. In many states, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>family errand</i>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>doctrine</i> is such that the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>father</i> can be reached. The daughter is presumably insolvent. Under agency principles, many states will say
that the daughter is an agent for the father on family business. But that doesn’t require consideration or a contract! Does agency require a business setting? No! It
often is a business setting, but that’s not required. The widow of the neurosurgeon can reach the
father and his two insurance policies under the family errand doctrine. It’s not a sure shot, but in many states it
would work.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
do we learn agency? Most of the work of
the world is done by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agents </i>working
for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principals</i>. Agency is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>conductor of liability</i>. Plaintiffs’
lawyers are always looking for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>financially
solvent parties</i> who are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reachable</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What,
then, is an agency? <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Agency</i> is an agreement by one person (an agent) to act <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>for </i>a principal at the principal’s
direction and control.</span></p>

padding:0in;mso-padding-alt:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

</div>

<br/>

<p><span>We
have established the definition of agency that we’ll work with: now let’s look
at the three subdivisions of agency: (1)
the servant-agent, (2) the non-servant agent, and (3) the non-agent.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The servant-agent</span></b></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span>The
servant-agent means precisely the same thing as “common law employee”. If the principal has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>legal power</i> to control the agent’s time allocation as well as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>how</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>when</i> the agent works, then the person is a servant-agent. So where does this come up? It comes up in tax and other statutes that
refer to the word “employee”. Both of
the Supreme Court cases we read for today get into this issue. Also, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>respondeat
superior</i> depends on this distinction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
the corporate scheme of things, how do board members fit? If a person is a director and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only</i> a director, then that person is not
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any type</i> of agent. How come? An agent is one who agrees to act <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>for</i>
the principal and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at the principal’s
control and direction</i>. This definition
doesn’t fit a director <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>qua</i> director,
because they are the ones who determine the principal’s policies! This has practical ramifications: there is no
wage withholding from the pay of directors. They get a check from the company and they have to pay by declaration of
estimated tax. Furthermore, in almost
all states, a person who is a director and only a director is not covered by
Worker’s Compensation or Equal Employment statutes. It’s the same way with a partner in a general
partnership. The partners, acting
together, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>determine</i> the partnership
policy. Thus, a partner of a partnership
is not an employee of the partnership and has no wage withholding.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are two statutory “curlicues” for this. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, and a number of other
states, partners in general partnerships can <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>elect</i> to participate in Worker’s Comp. Few people choose to do this, but Shipman
thinks that’s a mistake: this is a great tax deal! In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and several other states,
by statute, directors <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are </i>included in
Workers’ Comp. But that’s very
rare. A third “curlicue” or oddity: in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and a couple of other
states, in a closely held corporation, even if a person is both an officer <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> a director, there can be an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>opting out</i> of Workers’ Comp (but that’s
almost always a stupid thing to do).</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
the top officer of a corporation a servant-agent? Yes. If you carefully go through the definition, you’ll find that the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i> is the board of directors in
this case. They have the legal power to
allocate the time of the president. The
president of a corporation is a servant-agent. The president’s salary is withheld, and the president is covered by
Workers’ Comp and Equal Employment statutes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The non-servant agent</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>An
example of this would be a law firm that you hire to handle a legal
problem. You go talk to a partner of a
law firm, work out a fee, and they work on your problem (draft your will or
whatever). The partner offers to drive
out and talk to you at your house. The partner
of the law firm, while on the way to your house to see you, negligently runs
over and kills a baby. Nobody else is negligent. Does respondeat superior apply? No. The
doctrine of respondeat superior applies only where the agent is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>servant-agent</i>. With the law firm downtown, I don’t have the
legal power to tell them <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>how</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>when</i> to do the work for me. I can control the result, but I can’t control
the process. Respondeat superior is
built upon the premise that where there is a servant-agent over whom the
principal has the legal power over their physical activities, the principal is liable
whether or not he is negligent in hiring and training that agent. On the other hand, respondeat superior doesn’t
apply to a non-servant agent. Does that
mean that the plaintiff’s mother is out of legal theories? No. If
I was negligent in hiring the firm, that is, I negligently entrusted them to
drive to my home, then I am liable. But
how can that <span class=GramE>be</span> proved? Maybe the partners of the firm had run over
10 babies in the last year, and I became aware of this. Then my hiring of the law firm to come to my
home may be negligent.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
doesn’t Shipman use the term independent contractor? “It’s because it’s the work of the devil.” The Restatement uses it to include people who
are not agents and those who are not servant-agents. Courts use it to mean something
different. So use Shipman’s topology and
you won’t get screwed up!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
president of GM is a common law employee, or servant-agent, or GM. But the outside law firm of GM is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> a servant-agent of GM. So we have defined agency. It can be personal or business-related. It can be contractual or not. It need not be in writing, usually.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, by statute, if you ask
your agent to sign a real estate brokerage contract on your behalf, the broker,
in order to hold you, will have to show a signed power of attorney from you to
your agent. That is not true in many
other states. Under the Uniform
Commercial Code, if goods are involved, you will find many requirements for a
signed writing. But in most cases, you
don’t need it. You need to satisfy the
general statute of frauds, and also it’s just prudent to have a signed writing.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Consequences of agency</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Agency
is very broad. What are some of the
consequences of agency? One of the most
crucial consequences is that any agency relationship creates heavy <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fiduciary duties</i> running <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both ways</i>. For example, in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Russ v. TRW</i>, an Ohio Supreme Court case post-1980, a huge
Cleveland-based defense contractor was doing very profitable work for the
Defense Department. Russ was a young
accountant assigned to calculate the cost figure in “cost plus”. He came up with figure “x”, and went to his
boss, who said “this figure is too small”. He was told to change the figure to “5x”. The Defense Department finally figured out
the scam. There are lots of fraud statutes
on the books. An investigation uncovers
the young accountant, who is taken into the FBI Headquarters and “scared
shitless”. They play psychological
hardball with him. They tell him about </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Leavenworth</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
 >Atlanta</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. Then they say there’s a way out “because they’re
nice”. If he cooperates and wears a
wire, then they’ll go to the U.S. Attorney and tell him to give Russ
immunity. That would be great if Russ
were James Bond. Instead, Russ had a
nervous breakdown and he went to see a psychiatrist. The company fired him, saying it was his
fault.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Russ
sued under a section of the Restatement of Agency saying the following: “If the
principal knows that what the principal is ordering the agent to do is criminal,
the principal must tell the agent up front that what the agent is being told to
do is a crime.” The Ohio Supreme Court
held that this fiduciary duty was violated. They granted punitive damages (and in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, when you get punitive
damages, you also get attorney’s fees). The big test on punitive damages in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> is <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zoppo</i></span>, from 1995. In order to get punitive damages, you must
show “spite”, “actual express malice”, “terrible insult”, or “conscious
disregard of the rights of others”. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, mere recklessness will not
get you punitive damages. One of the defenses
offered was the Workers’ Comp immunity, which usually shields the employer from
suit when they are hurt on the job. The
injury here was psychological. That’s
the fiduciary duty running from the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i>
to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agent</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A major
fiduciary duty running from the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agent</i>
to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i> is a duty to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>promptly</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>accurately account </i>and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>disclose</i>. Here’s a hypo: you’re hired as a debt
collector, and you’re dealing with very poor people. You collect in cash. At the end of each day, you must write out a
report on what you’ve collected and turn it over. That’s a fiduciary duty. In the corporate area, directors, officers,
all employees, promoters, and controlling persons owe a heavy fiduciary duty to
the corporation, and in some cases they also owe the duty to the minority
shareholders. The law of fiduciary duty
is a big part of this course.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The agent’s lien</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>A <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lien</i> is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>charge upon</i>, or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>interest in</i>,
property. Speaking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>poetically</i>, it is a rough form of co-ownership. How do we know that? We read the Graham memo on attorney’s
liens. Your attorney is your non-servant
agent. You can’t tell him how to do his
job. You can control the result, but not
the exact process. A general rule is
that an agent <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not paid </i>what the
principal <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>promises to pay </i>him <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i> (emphasis on <span class=GramE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i></span>) have a lien on property of
the principal in his possession. Graham
discusses how in the personal injury context, if you go to a lawyer and retain
him for a one-third contingent fee, and he drafts an engagement letter with
strong attorney’s lien language in it, and the attorney for the defendant <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knows of</i> that lien, and the defendant
settles with your client without your knowledge, cuts the check solely to your
client, the defendant is going to have to pay <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>twice</i> as to your one-third. Why? If you had the lien through
the right language in the contract and the defendant knew about it, you, as a
lawyer have a “hard-core” property interest in that cause of action. It can be settled without liability to the defendant
only with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>two signatures</i>: yours and
the defendant’s. If an insurance company
has a subrogation right to the settlement, there may need to be three
signatures on the settlement agreement. Liens
are important!!!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
we have this guy collecting money, in cash, from poor people. He doesn’t use force and he doesn’t lie, but
he is persistent. Let’s say the deal he
has with his principal is that the agent gets to keep 20% of what he
collects. He’ll come by at the end of
the day with the money and the statement of account, and the principal will
write the agent a check for the 20%. Let’s
say everything goes well for six months. One day, you collect $1,000. You
give the principal the report and say that he’ll get the cash when you get the
check for your 20% ($200). The principal
says: “No. You’re being paid too
much. Give me the money!” The agent can count out $800 in cash, give it
to him, keep the $200 and walk out. That
would be a perfectly valid agent’s lien because the deal is 20%.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Liens
of agents are crucial, and attorney’s liens are one of the most important. Graham’s memo also develops the concept of
subrogation. An insurance company would
have a lien on the settlement of the personal injury claim by way of
subrogation.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
another hypo: there’s both a first and second mortgage on property. The mortgagor missed a mortgage payment and
the first mortgage forecloses. Under the
law in most states, the second mortgage will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>lose</i> its <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in rem</i> rights
against the property with the foreclosure of the first mortgage. It won’t lose the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>in personam</i> rights on the note. Therefore, when a first mortgage is foreclosed, very often the second
mortgagee, to protect themselves, will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>buy
in</i> at the foreclosure sale (will be the high bidder). Braunstein can tell us why this is so, but
Shipman doesn’t know. When the second
mortgagee buys the first mortgagee’s interest, most courts hold that, by
subrogation, the second mortgagee gets <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i>
of the rights of the first mortgagee, and that can be crucial.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Notice</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Notice
to a sufficiently important agent of a principal is notice to the principal
itself at common law. In the U.S.
Supreme Court, post-1990, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote an opinion regarding an
EEOC proceeding where the plaintiff lost at the administrative agency
level. The statute says that a losing
claimant may appeal within 30 days of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>notice
to him</i>. The lawyer tried the case,
went on a European vacation, and didn’t leave the memo with his secretary of
what to do if things happen during your absence. That’s malpractice per se. The <span class=GramE>lawyer was in </span></span><st1:place><span
 class=GramE><span>Europe</span></span></st1:place><span
class=GramE><span>, and, let’s
say</span></span><span>, on
July 1<sup>st</sup>, the case was decided and the administrative law judge sent
him a copy of the opinion. The secretary
got it in his absence. The lawyer is in </span><st1:place><span
>Europe</span></st1:place><span> for a long time, and then
on July 15<sup>th</sup>, the administrative law judge sends a copy to the plaintiff. On August 3<sup>rd</sup>, the lawyer returns
from </span><st1:place><span>Europe</span></st1:place><span> and promptly files a notice
of appeal. If you measured the 30 days
from when the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>plaintiff</i> got notice,
then this appeal is timely. But if you
measure from July 1<sup>st</sup>, then the appeal is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not timely</i>. Rehnquist found
that the secretary was the agent of the lawyer, the secretary got it on July 1<sup>st</sup>,
notice to the secretary is notice to the lawyer under the law of agency, and
the client is kicked out of court. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>However</i>, the client has a good
malpractice cause of action against the lawyer.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There’s
an exception in Article I of the Uniform Commercial Code that tries to reverse
the common law rule. If you want to get
fast notice, and you’re dealing with an organization, give notice not only to
the local guy but also to the president in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and the general counsel of the
company in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Explain why you’re doing it. But this is perfectly okay, and you better do
this if you want to “start the clock running”. Keep in mind that provision of the Uniform Commercial Code.</span></p>

          >There can�t be a business without individuals who own it and run it.
          Any talk of the taxation of businesses must therefore include a word
          or two about the taxation of individuals. We�ll just do the
          fundamentals now. Businesses compute income for tax purposes about the
          same way. But then how the business is treated for tax purposes varies
          based on what form it uses. The Internal Revenue Service has two
          different taxation methods described as �corporate� and �partnership�
          taxation. Corporate income taxation is described in Subchapters C and
          S, while partnership income taxation is found in Subchapter K.</span

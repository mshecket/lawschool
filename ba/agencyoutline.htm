<a name="_Toc76362584"><b>Introduction</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:1'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Agency</i> is a legal
relationship that is crucial to any common law legal system because most of the
work in the world is done by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agents</i>
working for their <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i>. The law of agency covers both personal
activities <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> business
activities. You don't need the
formalities of a contract or consideration in order to have an agency
relationship, though they are very often present. For instance, in many states, the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>family errand</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>doctrine</i> says that a parent can be found liable for the negligence
of a child who they send on an errand. Under agency principles, many states will say that the child is an agent
for the parent on family business.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Most of the work of the world is done by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agents </i>working for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>principals</i>. Agency is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>conductor of liability</i>. Plaintiffs' lawyers are always looking for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>financially solvent parties</i> who are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reachable</i>. What is an agency? <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Agency</i>
is an agreement by one person (an agent) to act <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>for </i>a principal at the principal's direction and control. We have established the definition of agency
that we'll work with: now let's look at the three subdivisions of agency: (1) the servant-agent, (2) the non-servant
agent, and (3) the non-agent.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc76362585"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The servant-agent</b></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p>The servant-agent means precisely the same thing as "common
law employee". If the principal has <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>legal power</i> to control the agent's time
allocation as well as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>how</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>when</i> the agent works, then the person is
a servant-agent. So where does this come
up? It comes up in tax and other
statutes that refer to the word "employee". Both of the Supreme Court cases we read for today get into this issue. Also, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>respondeat
superior</i> depends on this distinction.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In the corporate scheme of things, how do board members
fit? If a person is a director and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only</i> a director, then that person is not
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any type</i> of agent. How come? An agent is one who agrees to act <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>for</i>
the principal and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at the principal's
control and direction</i>. This
definition doesn't fit a director <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>qua</i>
director, because they are the ones who determine the principal's
policies! This has practical
ramifications: there is no wage withholding from the pay of directors. They get a check from the company and they
have to pay by declaration of estimated tax. Furthermore, in almost all states, a person who is a director and only a
director is not covered by Workers' Compensation or Equal Employment
statutes. It's the same way with a
partner in a general partnership. The
partners, acting together, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>determine</i>
the partnership policy. Thus, a partner
of a partnership is not an employee of the partnership and has no wage
withholding.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There are two statutory "curlicues" for this. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
and a number of other states, partners in general partnerships can <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>elect</i> to participate in Workers'
Comp. Few people choose to do this, but
Shipman thinks that's a mistake: this is a great tax deal! In <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
and several other states, by statute, directors <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>are </i>included in Workers' Comp. But that's very rare. A third "curlicue"
or oddity: in <st1:State><st1:place>Maryland</st1:place></st1:State> and a
couple of other states, in a closely held corporation, even if a person is both
an officer <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> a director, there can
be an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>opting out</i> of Workers' Comp
(but that's almost always a stupid thing to do).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Is the top officer of a corporation a servant-agent? Yes. If you carefully go through the definition, you'll find that the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i> is the board of directors in
this case. They have the legal power to
allocate the time of the president. The
president of a corporation is a servant-agent. The president's salary is withheld, and the president is covered by
Workers' Comp and Equal Employment statutes.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc76362586"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The non-servant agent</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Respondeat superior is built upon the premise that where
there is a servant-agent over whom the principal has the legal power over their
physical activities, the principal is liable whether or not he is negligent in
hiring and training that agent. On the
other hand, respondeat superior doesn't apply to a non-servant agent, though
some other theory like negligent hiring may apply. Officers of corporations are servant-agents,
but directors or outside law firms are not servant-agents. So we have defined agency. It can be personal or business-related. It can be contractual or not. It need not be in writing, usually.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, by statute, if you ask
your agent to sign a real estate brokerage contract on your behalf, the broker,
in order to hold you, will have to show a signed power of attorney from you to
your agent. That is not true in many
other states. Under the Uniform
Commercial Code, if goods are involved, you will find many requirements for a
signed writing. But in most cases, you
don't need it. You need to satisfy the
general statute of frauds, and also it's just prudent to have a signed writing.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc76362587"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Consequences of agency</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>One of the most crucial consequences is that any agency
relationship creates heavy <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fiduciary
duties</i> running <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both ways</i>. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Russ
v. TRW</i>, an Ohio Supreme Court case post-1980, a contractor was doing work
for the Defense Department. Russ was a
young accountant assigned to calculate the cost figure in "cost plus". He came up with figure "x", and went to his
boss, who said "this figure is too small". He was told to change the figure to "5x". The Defense Department finally figured out
the scam. There are lots of fraud
statutes on the books. An investigation
uncovers the young accountant, who is taken into the FBI Headquarters and
"scared shitless". Russ had a nervous
breakdown and he went to see a psychiatrist. The company fired him, saying it was his fault. Russ sued under a section of the Restatement
of Agency saying the following: "If the principal knows that what the principal
is ordering the agent to do is criminal, the principal must tell the agent up
front that what the agent is being told to do is a crime." The Ohio Supreme Court held that this
fiduciary duty was violated. They
granted punitive damages (and in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
when you get punitive damages, you also get attorney's fees). The big test on punitive damages in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
is <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zoppo</i></span>,
from 1995. In order to get punitive
damages, you must show "spite", "actual express malice", "terrible insult", or
"conscious disregard of the rights of others". In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, mere recklessness
will not get you punitive damages. One of
the defenses offered was the Workers' Comp immunity, which usually shields the
employer from suit when they are hurt on the job. The injury here was psychological. That's the fiduciary duty running from the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i> to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>agent</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A major fiduciary duty running from the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>agent</i> to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i> is
a duty to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>promptly</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>accurately account </i>and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>disclose</i>. Here's a hypo: you're hired as a debt
collector, and you're dealing with very poor people. You collect in cash. At the end of each day, you must write out a
report on what you've collected and turn it over. That's a fiduciary duty. In the corporate area, directors, officers,
all employees, promoters, and controlling persons owe a heavy fiduciary duty to
the corporation, and in some cases they also owe the duty to the minority
shareholders. The law of fiduciary duty
is a big part of this course.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc76362588"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The agent's lien</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lien</i> is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>charge upon</i>, or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>interest in</i>, property. Speaking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>poetically</i>, it is a
rough form of co-ownership. How do we
know that? We read the Graham memo on
attorney's liens. Your attorney is your
non-servant agent. You can't tell him
how to do his job. You can control the result,
but not the exact process. A general
rule is that an agent <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not paid </i>what
the principal <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>promises to pay </i>him <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i> (emphasis on <span class=GramE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may</i></span>) have a lien on property of
the principal in his possession. Graham
discusses how in the personal injury context, if you go to a lawyer and retain
him for a one-third contingent fee, and he drafts an engagement letter with
strong attorney's lien language in it, and the attorney for the defendant <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knows of</i> that lien, and the defendant
settles with your client without your knowledge, cuts the check solely to your
client, the defendant is going to have to pay <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>twice</i> as to your one-third. Why? If you had the lien through
the right language in the contract and the defendant knew about it, you, as a
lawyer have a "hard-core" property interest in that cause of action. It can be settled without liability to the
defendant only with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>two signatures</i>:
yours and the defendant's. If an
insurance company has a subrogation right to the settlement, there may need to
be three signatures on the settlement agreement. Liens are important!!!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Liens of agents are crucial, and attorney's liens are one of
the most important. Graham's memo also
develops the concept of subrogation. An
insurance company would have a lien on the settlement of the personal injury
claim by way of subrogation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here's another hypo: there's both a first and second
mortgage on property. The mortgagor
missed a mortgage payment and the first mortgage forecloses. Under the law in most states, the second
mortgage will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lose</i> its <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in rem</i> rights against the property with
the foreclosure of the first mortgage. It won't lose the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in personam</i>
rights on the note. Therefore, when a
first mortgage is foreclosed, very often the second mortgagee, to protect
themselves, will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>buy in</i> at the
foreclosure sale (will be the high bidder). Braunstein can tell us why this is so, but Shipman doesn't know. When the second mortgagee buys the first
mortgagee's interest, most courts hold that the second mortgagee gets <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> of the rights of the first
mortgagee, and that can be crucial.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc76362589"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Notice</b></a></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Notice to a sufficiently important agent of a principal is
notice to the principal itself at common law. In the U.S. Supreme Court, post-1990, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote an
opinion regarding an EEOC proceeding where the plaintiff lost at the
administrative agency level. The statute
says that a losing claimant may appeal within 30 days of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>notice to him</i>. The lawyer
tried the case, went on a European vacation, and didn't leave the memo with his
secretary of what to do if things happen during your absence. That's malpractice per se. The <span class=GramE>lawyer was in </span><st1:place><span
 class=GramE>Europe</span></st1:place><span class=GramE>, and, let's say</span>,
on July 1<sup>st</sup>, the case was decided and the administrative law judge
sent him a copy of the opinion. The
secretary got it in his absence. The
lawyer is in <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> for a long time, and then on July 15<sup>th</sup>,
the administrative law judge sends a copy to the plaintiff. On August 3<sup>rd</sup>, the lawyer returns
from <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and promptly files a notice of appeal. If you measured the 30 days from when the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>plaintiff</i> got notice, then this appeal
is timely. But if you measure from July
1<sup>st</sup>, then the appeal is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not
timely</i>. Rehnquist found that the
secretary was the agent of the lawyer, the secretary got it on July 1<sup>st</sup>,
notice to the secretary is notice to the lawyer under the law of agency, and
the client is kicked out of court. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>However</i>, the client has a good
malpractice cause of action against the lawyer.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There's an exception in Article I of the Uniform Commercial
Code that tries to reverse the common law rule. If you want to get fast notice, and you're dealing with an organization,
give notice not only to the local guy but also to the president in <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State> and the general counsel of the company in <st1:State><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:State>. Explain
why you're doing it. But this is
perfectly okay, and you better do this if you want to "start the clock
running". Keep in mind that provision of
the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Corporate and partnership law draw heavily on agency law and
the law of insurance. The <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Perl</i></span> case
involves insurance in the context of a law firm. We do quite a bit in this course with law
firms.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:1'><a name="_Toc76362590"><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Respondeat
superior</i></b></a><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'></i></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Respondeat superior</i>
– "Let the master answer." What is this
doctrine? If you have (1) a
servant-agent, (2) acting within the scope of employment, (3) who commits a
tort, the actor is liable, but, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in
addition</i>, the master (the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>principal</i>)
is liable even if the master is without fault. That's an agency doctrine. The
related tort doctrine says that if the principal was negligent in hiring,
training, or failing to fire the agent, then you can sue the principal in
tort. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Respondeat superior</i> is much more worrisome.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>In any organization of any size, there will be the agents
doing the work at the bottom, and in the middle and toward the top there will
be several layers of managing agents like foremen, plant superintendents, and
finally the president up at the top. Does respondeat superior apply to those managing agents so as to make
them, in addition to the principal (the corporation) liable without fault? The answer is no, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>but</i> under Rest.2d Agency, followed by <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
here's the deal as to the managing agent: he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>can</i>, without liability, reasonably delegate, but his initial
delegation must be reasonable and there must be reasonable supervision
thereafter. If he fails either one of
these tests, he can be liable to the third party.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Note the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Holy Trinity</i>
of agency law: (1) P – the principal, (2) A – the agent, and (3) TP – for the
third party. It's like a troika! They're tied together.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let's go over these rules carefully. With a few exceptions, noted tomorrow, the
principal found liable under respondeat superior has a good cause of action in
indemnification (that's one way to look at it) or in subrogation (another way)
against the bus driver. Let's stop and
think about this: the subrogation theory is probably the more obvious one. In paying off the parents of the deceased
baby, under duress (that is, a legal judgment) the principal becomes subrogated
to the baby's rights against the bus driver. But there's a big, important exception: if the principal has an
insurance policy covering both him and the agent, then the principal cannot go
against the agent because the insurance company is covering both of them and if
the insurance company went against the agent, the insurance company would have
to pay off what they won against the agent and there is a big legal principle
involved: where this is a pure <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>circuity</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> of action</i>,
the courts will not entertain the matter.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What's a pure <span class=SpellE>circuity</span> of
action? If A sues B in court and A wins,
B has, as a matter of law, a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mirror-image
cause of action</i> against A in the same amount. But the courts won't entertain it! Also, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the
Supreme Court has held that the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is liable for the negligence of one of its agents. The common law principle allowing the
principal to go against the agent <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does not
exist</i>. <st1:place>Douglas</st1:place>
says that the statute didn't give them this right! But this decision could have gone just the
other way. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
this is handled more by statute. By
negligence, it will be the same situation. If all you're alleging is negligence, you generally have to go against
the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> alone, and you
can't join the state employer. However,
if you're alleging something worse than negligence, you can sue <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>both</i> the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and </i>the individual.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>caution</i>: you
may have to bring one action in the Court of Claims, and bring simultaneously
the second one in the Court of Common Pleas. Likewise, the Ohio Supreme Court has held, generally speaking, that only
the Ohio Court of Claims can determine whether an employee was in the scope of
employment. In addition, with both the <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and Federal Courts of Claims, they have no equity jurisdiction and no
restitution jurisdiction. Only a <st1:Street><st1:address>Federal
  District Court</st1:address></st1:Street> or a state Court of Common Pleas
can sit in equity. When you sue the
government, you often have to file two parallel suits!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>We've looked at agency in the tort setting; now we'll look
at three prototypical agency cases in the contract setting. Say you have X, Inc., and Ms. Jones,
president of the company. Say Ms. Jones
enters into a large but not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extraordinary</i>
construction contract. When you get to
extraordinary items, you'll have to have the approval of the board of
directors. That's why we presume the
contract is not extraordinary. The
contract is in writing and is described in the first paragraph as a contract
between TP (Third Party) and X, Inc. Then at the signature block at the bottom, we find it set up as follows:
"X, INC., by: Jane Jones, Pres.<span class=GramE>" TP</span> will sign above. Jane Jones signs on the dotted line. That means that Jones has signed in her <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>corporate capacity</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If there is (1) actual authority on the part of the agent,
(2) the contract describes itself as a contract between TP and X, Inc. and (3)
the signature block reads properly (agency capacity) then there is a valid
contract between TP and X, Inc. and Jones has no personal liability on such a
contract, with the exception of fraud, in which case TP may sue Jones and
clearly sue X, Inc. for rescission and, in some states, TP can sue X, Inc. for
damages. If TP <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>wants</i> Jones to have personal liability, there will have to be
material below the line reading: "I, Jane Jones, in my individual capacity, do
hereby guarantee the performance and payment of this contract." Then she'll sign again, just simply as "Jane
Jones" with nothing under the signature. That is not present in our example here. If there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual </i>authority,
the fact that the third party does not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>believe</i>
there is actual authority is totally irrelevant. Usually the third party <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>will</i> believe it, but if, in fact, TP didn't really believe it, it
doesn't matter.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>It comes in two flavors: (1) express and (2) implied. Either flavor suffices. The difference between the two goes back to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>McCullough v. Maryland</i> and Chief Justice
Marshall's opinion dealing with the Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He said: "Let the end be legitimate and proper and all powers necessary
to reach that end are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied</i>." That's a Constitutional Law principle. Conceptually, actual authority results from
manifestations by the principal to the agent that she has such authority. These manifestations can come in various
ways: (1) in the charter, (2) in the regulations, (3) in the resolutions of the
board of directors, or (4) if the principal has ratified similar transactions
by the agent in the past.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you are dealing with a big corporation that is heavy on paperwork,
on a big transaction, supplies will sometimes require a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>purchase order</i> or a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>board of <span
class=GramE>directors</span> resolution</i> up front because they don't want to
get into <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>litigation</i>. The flip side is that if you are the third
party and you're dealing with the president, and you submit the bill to the
corporate treasury for payment, the treasurer may ask the president where the
purchase order or board of <span class=GramE>directors</span> resolution can be
found. That is a practical matter. In addition, a sophisticated supplier not
under pressure in a big transaction will request the signed, written opinion of
the outside counsel to the corporation because this will get everyone in gear
to make sure the paperwork is clear.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What about powers of attorney? A power of attorney is a written instrument
creating agency. You'll have a serious
operation, for example, with a lot of bad medicine for six weeks. You would stop and fill out a power of
attorney to your spouse, parent, or close friend, sign it, and give it to
them. Powers of attorney come in two
flavors: (1) general power of attorney, and (2) special power of attorney,
which is more limited.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There is an old Third Circuit case from the 1940's called <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Von <span class=SpellE>Wedel</span></i>. In <st1:City><st1:place>New York City</st1:place></st1:City>,
there was a married couple where the wife was a <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> citizen and the husband had a Green
Card but was a German citizen. It was
1940, 18 months before the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
entered the war. The husband decided he
had to go back to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and fight. Before he left, he made out a
power of attorney to his friend X with the broadest possible general powers in
it. X can do anything that husband was
allowed to do. X thought the husband's
assets were about to be seized by the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> government. X uses the power of attorney to transfer all
of the husband's assets to the wife. The
United States Department of Justice challenged the transfer, and the Third
Circuit found that gifts of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all assets</i>
were so unusual that it could not be done under even the most <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>general</i> power of attorney. What should the husband have done? He should have transferred the assets himself
before he left, because that would have been <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>unchallenged</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Today we deal with something similar to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>special</i> power of attorney. We're dealing with the actions of partners, directors, or high officers
of business associations. Take the facts
of the example above, and let's say that in the articles of incorporation of X,
Inc. is a provision that says "no officer or employee shall cause a corporate
contract to be entered into for more than $5,000, unless the board of directors
first authorizes." Let us say for the
sake of argument that the contract in question is for $50,000. In the past three years, Jones, as president,
on behalf of X with respect to everyone she's dealt with, she has signed contracts
for $50,000 or $100,000 and the parties have been paid. This shows <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>apparent</i> though not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual</i>
authority.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc76362593"></a><a
name="_Toc76297549"><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc76362593'><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Apparent authority</b></span></a><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let's say more specifically that TP is unaware of the $5,000
limit in the articles of incorporation. The goods are delivered to X, Inc. and the invoice is sent to the
treasurer of X. He gets a nasty letter
back with a certified copy of the provision of the articles of
incorporation. Under these facts, TP <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can </i>hold X to the contract because a
type of reliance has been proven by TP. TP has shown that it did not know of the restriction on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual </i>authority. Thus, apparent authority kicks in. X is liable on the contract, and has, in
theory, a cause of action against Jones for any damages they can prove. The cause of action of X, Inc. against Jones
will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>disappear</i> if the board of
directors of X, Inc. expressly, implicitly, or by conduct ratifies or adopts
the contract. This action will make it
as if there was actual authority from the beginning. But if the board of directors does not
ratify, TP has a cause of action in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>restitution</i>
against X, Inc. There may also be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>hardcore</i> estoppel, fraud, and so
on. The tricky thing is that TP has an
action against Jones for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>breach of the
implied warranty</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied
representation of authority</i>. An
agent signing impliedly represents or warrants that he or she <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>has </i>authority (in some states, this is
watered down to "reasonably believes he or she has authority").</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>On the other hand, let's change the facts such that TP is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>aware</i> of the $5,000 limit in the
articles of incorporation. TP went to
the statehouse and read X's charter before dealing with Jane Jones. There is no apparent authority in Jones in
this case, because TP cannot make out an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>apparent
</i>authority case if TP knows there is no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual
</i>authority.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Along the same lines of the agent's liability, under the
UCC, if you sign a negotiable instrument as an agent and you <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do not bind</i> the principal, under the
UCC, you as agent have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>total</i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>automatic</i> liability. Furthermore, in about four states, if an
agent signs as an agent and doesn't bind the principal, then it's automatic
personal liability. But that's a
minority view.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If you're dealing with federal, state, or local government,
the agent you're dealing with must have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual
</i><span class=GramE>authority,</span> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>none
at all</i>. There is no such thing as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>apparent </i>authority when it comes to
government. Obviously, however,
restitution may be available against a government. If the government commits fraud, you must
check the Federal Tort Claims Act, which tends to negate fraud. It has numerous exceptions, including acts by
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
government abroad. If you're in <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
for example, and a <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
government army truck runs you over negligently, you probably have no claim
under the FTCA. When your back is to the
wall, don't forget the possibilities of restitution and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>true</i> estoppel (where the principal has held out and you have relied
to your detriment).</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Consider the case of <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Maglica</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. <span
class=SpellE>Maglica</span></i>. <span
class=SpellE>Maglica</span> started <span class=SpellE>Mag-Lite</span> in his
garage 35 years ago. He had been married
and divorced. He met a woman about his
age <span class=GramE>who</span> had also been married and divorced. The woman became active in the business for
20 or 25 years. One day, he booted her
out. She sued under various theories
including <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>restitution</i> (benefits
conferred). The business was worth about
$600 million at the time, and she sued for $300 million. The jury came back with a verdict for
hundreds of millions of dollars. The
Court of Appeals sent it back for a new trial because they said the
instructions were insufficient. Restitution is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>smaller</i> of
the work you put out versus the reasonable value of the benefits
conferred. She settled for $30 million.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>There was also <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marvin
v. Marvin</i>. A young woman moved in
with Lee Marvin. Later, he booted her
out and there was a suit for the reasonable value of services. This opinion lays out the issues nicely. The first issue is whether it is the
transaction is more or less prostitution and thus against public policy. They found that she could recover
something. But in many other states,
it's a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>complete non-starter</i>. In <st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>,
by statute or constitutional amendment, they recently prohibited <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marvin v. Marvin</i> kinds of lawsuits.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>So first you consider whether you have the approval of the
board of directors. In the cases we're
dealing with today, we are assuming that these are instances where you <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>don't</i> need the board's approval. In a close corporation, the standards can
vary, either tighter or looser. Shipman
has seen cases going both ways. In a
tearjerker of a case, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brandywine Racing</i>
in the Delaware Court of Chancery in the 1940's, a group of guys got together,
deciding that <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State> needed a
new racetrack. To build a racetrack, you
need approval from the racing commission. To get the racing commission's approval, you need good architects'
plans. The company was formed, and a
couple of the directors went to the architect, asking if he would expedite the
drafting of the plans. The board of
directors did not formally act. The two
people who negotiated with the architect did not own a substantial percentage
of the company. The architect delivered
the plans on time and the racing commission delivered permission for the
track. <span class=GramE>Sounds good so
far.</span></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But "who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men"? The architect sends a bill to the
company. The two directors didn't have
the actual authority to make the deal! The company tells the architect that they will get nothing! A lawsuit was brought, and it went to a bench
trial. The court holds that there was no
actual or apparent authority for the directors to do the deal with the
architect. The lawyer says to the court:
"Give us the same amount under restitution: benefits conferred!" The judge got the complaint out and found
there was no count two for restitution. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The architect is screwed! The moral of the story is, always put in
count two for restitution! The law firm
committed malpractice! Always look at
all of you theories, because the typical case today will have five or six
different causes of action.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Consider a <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>
case from the late 1940's involving a close corporation. The war broke out in late 1941, and a lot of
people did a lot of patriotic things. A
top officer at this close corporation circulated a memo to the plant workers
and told them that those who wanted to enlist and serve would be given a check
for the difference between their military pay and their civilian pay at the
plant. Many employees did enlist, and
most came back and did not submit the claim for reimbursement. The plaintiff did and was fired! (Today, that would be an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>abusive discharge</i> under <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
law.) There was a big trial in which the
court decided that the offer was so momentous that only the board of directors
could have authorized it. The board of
directors never formally took up the proposal. But the court held, however, that since it's a close corporation and two
directors knew about it, there was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>implied
ratification</i> or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>adoption</i>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>National Biscuit Co.
v. Stroud</i> – Here we have a 50-50 two man partnership running a grocery
store. The first partner said: "Don't
buy from X." The second partner
continued to buy from X, who knew about the dispute. There could be no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>apparent</i> authority. They
read § 18 of the Uniform Partnership Act, which says that when you have a deadlock
among partners on this particular issue, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i>
partner has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual</i> authority for any
typical transaction. Substantially the
same result would have been reached under restitution. But the court upheld the contract.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Smith v. </i><st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dixon</i></st1:place></st1:City> – Under §
9, limits are imposed on partnership. If
you're a bank making a loan to a law firm that will be a business loan, <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cognovit</i></span> clauses
will be used by the bank. That's okay
for a business transaction in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. But there's a surprise in § 9…you'll have to
have the signature of every partner! It's the same for an arbitration agreement, the sale of all assets, or
the sale of goodwill. The law firm will
handle this by getting a power of attorney from each new partner as they are
admitted for limited purposes such as those specifically mentioned in § 9. The senior partner will sign once for
himself, and then once for each other partner, with an asterisk indicating that
he's using the power of attorney he got earlier.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here we have a family farming partnership in <st1:State><st1:place>Arkansas</st1:place></st1:State>. Various members of the family are
partners. They met one Sunday and
authorized the old man to sell the farm. But they told him not to go below $230,000. The old man signs for the partnership at
$210,000. It is binding on the
partnership and the other partners? Applying our catechisms, there was no actual authority because the
partnership assembled and under § 18 gave him <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>binding instructions</i> not to go under $230,000. However, as the court held, there was <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>apparent</i> authority and the third party
did not know of the secret limitation on the price. "Apparent authority makes the world go
round!" Therefore, there was a valid
contract binding on everyone.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>In the Matter of
Drive-In Development Corp.</i> – P, Inc. owned 100% of S, Inc. P, Inc. is borrowing money from a bank. P, Inc. happens to be in pretty bad shape
itself, while the subsidiary, S, happens to be in good financial shape. The bank wants what is known as an "upstream
written guaranty" by S, Inc. of S's liability to the bank. The corporate secretary for S, Inc. fills out
a certificate and delivers it to the bank stating that S's board of directors
has duly met and has unanimously approved the S guaranty. Based on that, S's president has signed the
guaranty on behalf of S, Inc. Later,
there is a bankruptcy and the bank files its claim both against P, Inc. and S,
Inc. There are two touchy issues: (1) <span
class=GramE>It</span> just so happened that the board of directors of S, Inc.
didn't actually meet, and an upstream guaranty is so unusual that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only the board of directors could approve it</i>. S, Inc. says "Sorry, the board didn't meet,
despite what the corporate secretary did. Without a board meeting, we're not liable on the guaranty!" On the agency issue, the court holds that
there is apparent authority. The notes
indicate some contrary authority. In the
later case, a reasonable person would have been put on notice if the secretary
was lying. (2) There also were the
fraudulent conveyance statutes. Here,
the attorney for S did not properly raise the issue in the bankruptcy
court. In a big 1990's Third Circuit
case, upstream guaranties were said not to be per se fraudulent.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Black v. Harrison Home
Co.</i> – Here we have a closely held corporation buying land to sell lot by
lot. As you come to the last lots,
you're selling substantially all of your assets. Does that mean that the company must have
board of directors and shareholders' approval for the last lots? When a land company contemplates that they'll
sell off the lots one by one, the officers themselves can do it. In the bylaws of the company, it said that
there had to be two officers' signatures on a contract for it to be valid. The parents started dying off and the
daughter was effectively the only owner and the only officer. She signed a contract on behalf of the
company for the sale of the last lot. Then she dies. Her estate has not
yet been probated. The court held that
there was <span class=GramE>no actual authority for her to sell with one
signature and that therefore the company could not be bound</span>. The case is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>clearly wrong</i> on modern standards because though she did not have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual</i> authority, she <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>did </i>have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>apparent</i> authority because the third party had no reason to know of
the unusual bylaw with the two signature requirement. The plaintiff's last theory was that the
corporate fiction should be disregarded because the daughter owned all the
stock and it would be silly to talk about lack of authority as an officer. The court said that would be true <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i> her estate is solvent enough to pay
off all her creditors. But the plaintiff's
counsel neglected to allege that to be the case, and the court won't go along
with them.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lee v. Jenkins Bros.</i>
– Here we have a closely held corporation where the president orally assured a
guy of a pension if he would switch employers. He worked for twenty years, after which he was laid off without a
pension. He sues the company. There are two defenses: (1) statute of
frauds, and (2) no authority on the part of the president to make this
contract. The district judge held that
in <st1:State><st1:place>Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State> at that time the
statute of frauds was a complete defense. He did not reach the authority issue. Then it goes to the Second Circuit which held that the authority issue
ought to be looked at too. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and in a number of states, very substantial partial performance will take you
out of the statute of frauds. In terms
of authority, lifetime contracts and contracts for a pension are viewed with
much suspicion by courts. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
and in a number of states, if you're an employee, you're better off with a
limited but long-term contract (10 or 20 years). Many states will say that a lifetime contract
is "too rich" and "too indefinite". The
case has a good discussion of apparent and actual authority. The court makes the point that if the board
of directors ratifies similar <span class=GramE>transactions, that</span> can
create <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual authority</i> in that it's
a signal to the agent that he has the authority. It can also create <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>apparent</i> authority to the world at large. The employee should have gotten the promise
in writing, and he should have gotten the board of directors to approve! Since the president owned most of the stock,
in a number of states, they would go with the employee on the agency issue and
it would help on the statute of frauds issue.</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Davis</i></st1:place></st1:City><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. <span class=SpellE>Sheerin</span></i> –
Here we have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>despicable</i> conduct on
the part of the majority shareholder. The majority shareholder claims that the minority shareholder isn't a
shareholder at all! The minority
shareholder brings an action for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>oppression</i>. Since what the majority shareholder was doing
was arguably <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>oppressive</i>, the minority
shareholder claims that the court should enter an order forcing the majority
shareholder to buy the minority shareholder's shares at market value without a
minority discount. The problem was that
until five years before, <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>
had a statute authorizing this remedy. The statute was modeled after <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
and <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>. (<st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
is silent on this issue right now.) The <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>
legislature had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>repealed</i> the
statute. The court held that as a court
of equity they have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inherent</i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>jurisdiction</i> under judge-made law to
enter the order. The order will cause a
sale of several hundred thousand dollars. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>, you would have to
hook up with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i>. You would have a pretty good chance, in
Shipman's view. The notes after this case
discuss oppression, which is a post-1960 <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>buzzword</i>. Just what is oppressive, though? You don't need violence or fraud in order to
have oppression. There was a <st1:State><st1:place>Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>
case where the majority shareholder ran the place and the minority shareholder
was simply ignored. That was seen to be
oppressive.</p>

<p>All agents are fiduciaries to their principals. No fiduciary, including an agent or a

v. Cargill</i> from the Nebraska Supreme Court from the 1980's. The Delaware Supreme Court agrees with this
case. X, Inc. was approached by Z, Inc.,
which said to the board of X, Inc. that they wanted to buy all or substantially
all of their assets. They proposed to
assume all of their disclosed, <span class=SpellE>noncontingent</span>, and
uncontested liabilities. In many states,
that might be considered a de facto merger, but <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
does not recognize de facto mergers. We
also don't have to worry about that because it was a cash offer. The federal securities laws and state Blue
Sky laws are inapplicable, at least as far as the Securities Act of 1933 goes,
because it's an all-cash offer in U.S. dollars. Could the officers themselves approve such a thing? The statutes in all states on this
transaction specify a two-step transaction. The directors of the selling corporation must approve and call a special
shareholders' meeting and a specified majority or supermajority of all the
shareholders must approve.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The directors of X, Inc. met with the people from Z, Inc.
and said: "Let's go!" They approved the
contract offered by Z, Inc. But notice
that the contract is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in limbo</i> and not
effective until the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shareholders</i> of
X, Inc. approve it at a meeting. The
contract included language saying that the directors of X, Inc. agreed to put
the matter before the shareholders of X, Inc. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and </i>"support [the offer], if consistent with the fiduciary duties
of the directors of X, Inc." Now, a second
suitor, B, Inc., comes along and talks to the directors of X, Inc., saying that
it will offer what it thinks is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>better
deal</i> by a cash tender offer to all shareholders of X, Inc. B says: "How's about it?" The directors did so, and of course, it screwed
up the shareholders' meeting called to approve the Z, Inc. offer. Z, Inc. brings an action against both B, Inc.
and all directors of X that in effect says: "I've been unjustly used as a
‘stalking horse'! I've been used to make
the main horse run faster!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The
directors backed out of their word! Give
us money and/or an injunction!" The case
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>should</i> have gone off on contract
principles. The language phoned in to
the X directors to put in the contract was standard and it says: "if the
fiduciary duties of the X, Inc. directors cause them to change their mind, they
can do so legally."</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Why? <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Here's a big deal:</i> the Nebraska Supreme
Court chose not to go by contract but rather by an agency principal. They said that if the X, Inc. directors
collectively held all or nearly all of the stock of X, Inc., the principal
would not buy because substantially all stock would have consented to an
alternate arrangement. (Note that
creditors have nothing to fear.) The <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
courts have picked this up in the case of <st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Paramount</i></st1:place></st1:City> from
1994, where <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State> expressly
approved <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ConAgra v. Cargill</i>. So what's a lock-up? It's unclear in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
exactly what you can do for a lock-up. Probably you can have a clause saying that if the deal doesn't go
through, Z, Inc. will be reimbursed for its legal, accounting, investment
banking and similar expenses. That is
called a "modest breakup fee" clause. In
states <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other than</i> <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>,
such a clause is valid. Some people have
tried to go further and include "massive breakup fees". In one recent case, there was a merger
involving $50-60 billion where the breakup fee was to the tune of $4-5
billion. It was paid, and there was no
suit over it.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Z, Inc.-type businesses of the world can negotiate an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>option</i> to purchase X, Inc.'s stock at
the current market price. The <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
court said that this can be done within limits, but you can't allow the person
to make a killing. If the stock is at
30, you can grant Z an option for 20% of the stock, except if the stock of X
goes over, for example, 40, then you can't allow them that particular
benefit. In 2003 in the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Omnicare</i></span> case,
there was a decision that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>boggles the
mind!</i> It was from the Delaware
Supreme Court. You had a situation where
about three shareholders of X, Inc. owned, collectively, 60%. The vote in <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
to approve a transaction is only a simple majority of all outstanding
shares. In <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
this often goes up to 2/3rds. Z, Inc.
contracted with the three directors who held 60% and got a promise from them in
their individual capacity that they would vote to approve the deal. B, Inc. entered and made a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>much</i> better offer. Z brought an action against the directors in
their individual and corporate capacities. The Delaware Supreme Court held that even though these three people were
contracting in their individual capacity concerning their stock, it still was
an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>impermissible lock-up</i> under <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
law. It was a 3-2 decision. The opinion said that if the directors, in
their individual capacity, had put the language in similar to what the <st1:City><st1:place>Houston</st1:place></st1:City>
lawyer put in as in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ConAgra v. Cargill</i>,
that is, that they would vote as shareholders to support <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>consistent with their fiduciary duties as directors</i>, <span
class=GramE>then</span> it probably would have been okay. There is a <st1:State><st1:place>Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>
case that followed the <st1:State><st1:place>Delaware</st1:place></st1:State>
case that was not as picky on lock-ups. We have no idea what the situation would be here in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Here's another big agency and fiduciary principle: no
fiduciary may <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unreasonably delegate</i>. Within a law firm, for example, a senior
partner conducts an interview and assures the potential client that they will
be treated right. They will be
introduced to the associates and told up front that the associates will do most
of the work under his supervision. If he
is a noted trial lawyer but he isn't going to try the case, you put that into
writing early on. If your firm takes a
case and you want the assistance of an outside law firm, you must first clear
that with the client in writing.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A Seventh Circuit case from <st1:State><st1:place>Indiana</st1:place></st1:State>
involves an <st1:State><st1:place>Indiana</st1:place></st1:State> insurance company. The company had entered into a 15-year
contract with C, whereby C was going to run everything. The company went insolvent. When an insurance company goes insolvent, the
state insurance commissioner goes to a state court and they take over the company's
assets. Creditors file claims. A claim was filed by C for compensation for
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>future</i> under the contract. This did not involve past, paid
compensation. The past compensation was
reasonable. There was no fraud. C had been doing his job. The Seventh Circuit held that this was a
highly unreasonable delegation by the board of directors of its functions, and
therefore the future portion of the contract was unenforceable and C would take
nothing. Today, if you're going to have
a contract like this, the lawyer will (1) research carefully and keep the
contract reasonable in length, (2) reword it to say: "I, C, will give advice to
the board of directors, which advice they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may
or may not</i> take in their own discretion".</p>

          dissolution, statutory merger, and control share acquisitions. All the
          directors and shareholders typically must approve of such
          transactions, and dissenting shareholders typically get appraisal
          rights so they can cash in their shares. This goes beyond so-called
          �reorganizations�, which come in two flavors: (1) recapitalization,
          and (2) amalgamations, or putting two or more companies together in
          one of several ways. In Wall Street firms, you never get a department
          labeled �amalgamations�; it�s always called �mergers and
          acquisitions�. Dissolution of the company is a big event!</span

          we talked about
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">defective incorporation</i>: de
          facto corporations and corporations by estoppel. We established that
          if a corporation was either a corporation de jure (meaning in perfect
          compliance) or de facto, nobody can complain about the errors. In this
          section, disregard of the corporate fiction, we go a step beyond that.
          All of these corporations are either corporations de jure or de facto.
          In other words, the plaintiff is not relying on some defect in
          formation, but instead is going to this question: assuming there is
          enough compliance to be de facto or de jure, can third parties
          nonetheless look through the corporate veil and hold the active
          shareholders, officers, and directors liable? There are seven
          different ways to do this.

          liability, meaning that if you serve excessive liquor to X, and X goes
          out and negligently kills Z, then Z�s survivors can bring suit against
          the bar. Based on this legislative victory for the bar owners, the
          Arrow Bar decided to drop its liability insurance. So their bartender
          serves too many drinks to X and X runs out and negligently kills Z,
          and Z�s survivors bring a wrongful death action. They sue the
          bartender. They try to sue the owners too. If they had been tending
          the bar themselves, then they could have been sued as primary
          actors.</span

          under respondeat superior, you can also sue the actor. There are three
          exceptions of recent vintage, however: (1) Under the Federal Tort
          Claims Act, if a United States government employee is merely
          negligent, your only suit is against the federal government itself,
          and the federal government cannot recover from the actor because the
          FTCA didn�t include statutory provisions to that effect. (2) In </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          and many other state tort claims acts, if a state or local employee is
          merely negligent, you can only sue the employer and you can�t join the
          employee, except if the employee has acted recklessly or worse, in
          which case you can sue both the employer and employee. (3) Under
          federal equal employment law, if an executive sexually harasses
          someone, you can�t sue that executive; you can only sue the private
          employer. This doesn�t seem to make sense! But this doctrine has been
          rejected through the </span

          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State

      <p>
        <span
          >So we can sue the corporation under respondeat superior. But the
          problem is that the corporation has a lot of debt to the bank and not
          much in the way of net assets once you consider its debts. The bank
          has a lot of perfected first mortgages on the borrower�s property,
          because the bank stays in business by taking mortgages on everything.
          Why would the bank loan to the company when it didn�t have much
          capital? The shareholders were forced by the bank to sign written
          guarantees before the bank lent to the corporation. That�s a fact of
          life! Until a corporation becomes fairly prosperous with a lot of
          assets of its own, banks won�t make loans to it unless they get a
          guarantee from the shareholders.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This is fairly pro-plaintiff in theory. The black letter rule is that
          undercapitalization is a key factor, but as to common torts, if the
          corporation has been covered with reasonable amounts of insurance,
          that will be considered adequate capitalization. There was no
          insurance policy here! They relied on the state statute! What�s wrong
          with that? The South Dakota Supreme Court declared the statute
          unconstitutional! The plaintiff argued that even though the company
          had some money, the fact that the shareholders had guaranteed the bank
          loan was enough to show undercapitalization.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In many states, if you have some kind of immunity and you nonetheless
          get insurance, then that will be deemed a waiver of immunity with one
          exception: if the insurance policy itself has a clause saying �the
          writing of the insurance by the insurance company and the getting of
          the insurance by the insured are not considered to be a waiver of any
          immunity or privilege�. If you work for an insurance company, you want
          to put that clause in all your policies because it will generally be
          honored. This is also becoming an issue for not-for-profit
          organizations. The cost of directors� and officers� insurance has gone
          way up! The premiums have probably doubled in the last five years!
          Non-profits have convinced their directors (or trustees) that there is
          nothing wrong with that. It�s true that it�s less of a problem than
          with a non-profit, but it�s still a problem.</span

          >A parent owns 100% of a subsidiary in the �gear-crunching� business.
          The subsidiary went to an insurance company and got a good policy. The
          subsidiary had a very negligent driver. The other driver was not
          negligent. The injured people can sue the trucking companies. But
          people who finance big trucking companies take out mortgages on the
          �big rigs�. So the injured party wants to pierce the corporate veil up
          to the wealthy parent corporation. There is no fraud, no soft
          estoppel, no mere sham, so we get to the question: if a parent owns
          100% of a subsidiary is there a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">per se</i> agency or
          partnership? But there is no per se! The very purpose of corporate law
          is to allow a parent to set up a 100% subsidiary. If they operate it
          right, the mere fact that you own it 100% doesn�t mean that the
          subsidiary is your agent or partner. If you don�t rule this way, you
          undercut the very basis of corporate law!</span

          But the answer to the rejoinder was that the insurance company went
          bankrupt! The court holds that there was no evidence that the
          subsidiary knew the insurance company was on shaky ground. They made
          reasonable efforts to get reasonable insurance, and having proved that
          they�re safe.</span

          lawyer created a corporation to start a swimming pool. A kid drowned
          due to the negligence of the pool�s employees. The plaintiff sued to
          pierce the corporate veil and named the company
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and</i> its major shareholders
          as defendants. The California Supreme Court held the piercing of the

        <span
          >Next, the plaintiff wanted to nail the lawyer for the company because
          he had acted as an

          law at the time required three directors. The client begged him to do
          it, and he consented. �The road to hell is paved with good
          intentions!� When the lawyer acts as an accommodation director or
          officer, he can be reached. The lawyer�s malpractice policy will
          usually exclude the lawyer acting as an officer, director, guardian or
          administrator. Plus, all insurance policies require a separate ERISA
          and environmental insurance policy. However, this court remanded for a
          new trial against the lawyer because he was not named as a part in the
          original suit. The California Supreme Court held that since he was not
          a party in the original suit, the findings against him were not res
          judicata or collateral estoppel. If you�re a plaintiff suing to pierce
          the corporate veil, you must name as additional parties to your suit

          plaintiff. The plaintiff wanted the judgment executed against the
          shareholders on the grounds of piercing of the corporate veil. The
          Court held that there was no way! If you want your judgment to apply
          to piercing parties as well as the company itself, you must name those
          parties in the original suit and serve them. This is one of the first

          under her name is not bound to the suit unless you name her! W may
          have more money than H if she saved her earnings! The contract rule on
          joint liability is that you must sue
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">all</i> jointly liable persons.
          However, with joint and several liability, you can

          first. If you win and think you can pick up more money against the
          others, then you can go and do it! In contract, however, that�s not
          so! So in a community property state, if you�re piercing against one

          the Eleventh Circuit, it was a Superfund case and the company couldn�t
          pay. Fleet Factors, however, was wealthy so the government went after
          them on the basis of a loan agreement between them and the little
          company. The government claims that the loan agreement was so broad as
          to make Fleet Factors either an owner or an operator for the purposes
          of the statute. There was a big cry in Corporate America, and the EPA
          issued a regulation purported to overturn the case! But that�s not
          all! The D.C. Circuit held the regulation invalid! If you work in
          environmental law, this case casts a long shadow. So work with an
          environmental lawyer early!</span

          substantially all assets, the directors must propose and the
          shareholders must approve. With a public company, the proxy statement
          will also be subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. R.C.
          1701.86-.91 say that if the shareholders vote to dissolve the company,
          that gives the directors the power to sell the assets. What�s the
          difference? R.C. 1701.73-.76 deals with the situation where the
          company will sell all its present assets, take the money, and start a
          new business. If you�re going to do this, you must give the dissenting
          shareholders a cash appraisal. If, on the other hand, the board of
          directors is empowered to sell the assets in dissolution pursuant to
          R.C. 1701.86-.91,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">there is no appraisal right</i

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">do not</i>, on top of that,
          adopt a sale of assets resolution, because if you do the latter under
          R.C. 1701.73-.76, the dissenting shareholders will get appraisal
          rights. Under 1701.95, if the directors don�t do that, they are
          individually personally liable jointly and severally. That tends to
          get your attention! Therefore, if it�s a manufacturing company and
          there is a R.C. 1701.86-.91 resolution and they sell their assets to
          GM, they will realize that there may be products liability in the
          future. What do they do? They go to an insurance broker and buy tail
          coverage from a solvent insurer. It�s the same kind of coverage a
          doctor or lawyer buys when they retire. It costs a premium on top of
          what normal yearly coverage starts. You don�t want to move to </span

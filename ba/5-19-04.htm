<p><b><span>The </span></b><st1:State><st1:place><b
 ><span>New York</span></b></st1:place></st1:State><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><span> Stock
Exchange – the “old way”</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
New York Stock Exchange is closely supervised by the SEC. The NYSE is a New York not-for-profit corporation,
which has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>member firms</i>. They include Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs, and many others. The NYSE
is a big operation. In a good year, it
will net $30 million in fees from member firms and traders. This exchange represents sort of the old
guard. There is not only an exchange “floor”
but also “posts”. Each “post” has 30-40
stocks and there you will find specialists: member firms of the NYSE whose job
is to be ready to buy and sell even if they must do <span class=GramE>so on</span>
their own account. Also, each big member
firm has at least one floor broker on the floor. <span class=GramE>These brokers</span>, if
they can’t find a broker who wants to be on the other side of the transaction,
goes to a specialist. Another actor is
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>floor governor</i>, there to settle
disputes.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
old way of doing things is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>continuous</i>. It’s “two-way”. It is done by open outcry. The American Stock Exchange does things about
the same way. If a company wants its
stock traded on NYSE or AMEX, they have to pay a big initial fee and also an
annual fee. Note that the old way is
pretty non-electronic and low tech. It’s
called a “continuous two-way auction market by open outcry”. The NYSE is very <span class=GramE>prestigious,</span>
the AMEX is also, somewhat.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are about 14,000 publicly traded companies in the country. They range in value from the biggest to
companies with only a few thousand shareholders and only a few tens of million
dollars in assets. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>But</i>, there are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>several
million </i>business associations in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 >United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. That includes limited liability companies, limited
liability partnerships, general partnerships, and so on. The advantage of the publicly traded company
is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>liquidity in the marketplace</i> for
the publicly-traded company.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Executive stock options</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>When
we left off yesterday, we were talking about rewarding <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>sweat equities</i> upon the formation of a company. That leads to the concept of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>options</i> for managers. Executive stock options used to be rare. Executives were paid by salaries, bonuses,
and benefits. In the 1970’s, executive
pay went way up. How come? Company executives basically thought they
should be treated like stars. So executive
stock option plans became very popular. They are governed by §§ 83, 61, and 162 of the Internal Revenue Code.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>§
83 <span class=GramE>tells</span> you the results of a non-transferable stock
option plan. When you advise a client
about options, ask for a plan! The plan
can only be adopted by the board of directors. No one else is allowed to do it! And if you’re a public company, you must follow SEC rules, including the
proxy rules at § 14 and under § 16 (about which more later). § 162 of the Internal Revenue Code <span
class=GramE>contains</span> a major subsection on executive stock options for
public companies.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
first thing to look for under the plan is the vesting period. It’s sort of “use them or lose them”
provision. The point of options is to
tie employees to the company in some sense: a kind of consideration. There are exceptions, though: options can
vest even if someone is no longer an employee if the person dies or is
seriously injured and can no longer work.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Take
the example of a ten year option on 100,000 shares of $1 par stock at the
current market price when the option was given: $10. The $10 is the “exercise price”. Another name is the “strike price”. Let’s say the person stayed at the company
for ten years, and now the stock is at $70. The person worked hard and got lucky!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
say the employee wants to exercise the option. The company is public. The employee
must come up with $1 million to exercise the option! Since it’s a public company, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a federal statute from three years ago, says that public
companies can’t lend money to insiders. If the employee is independently wealthy, he can come up with the
million. But for the average person,
this will be a problem. But the bigger
problem comes from the tax standpoint. Other than § 83, the grant of a non-transferable stock option to an
executive usually creates no income at that time. But if the employee wants to exercise the
option, he’s going to get taxable income, in this case to the tune of
$6,000,000! That is, 100,000 times $70
minus $10. But the good news is that
subject to certain limits in § 162 (which gives a deduction for only <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i> salaries)<span class=GramE>,</span>
the company gets a deduction in the same amount and in the same time that the
individual realizes that income! This
can make it so that a company doesn’t have to pay any income taxes!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Since
it’s a public company, the employee can use Rule 144 under the Securities Act
to sell within the volume limits of that Rule. If it’s a big company, this Rule will pose pretty much no problem. But if it’s a small company with just a few
hundred shareholders, it will be a big issue! The way out is to go to a big securities firm and coordinate with the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inside</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>outside</i> legal counsel of the company and with the CEO. Remember the Bernie <span class=SpellE>Ebbers</span>
story! He fired one of his top
executives for not telling him when he was going to exercise his options!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
brokerage house will lend the employee some money to exercise the option, sell
enough of the stock to pay back the loan plus taxes (state, city, federal,
Medicare, Medicaid and all that), and give him the rest. He will have to get the company to sign off
on this because the option plan will have a provision about tax
withholding. The company must withhold taxes
on the gross income (federal, state, city, and the employee’s Medicare
tax). The company, the brokerage house,
and the employee will enter into a contract. The brokerage house will get its fee, <span class=GramE>then</span>
remit the withholding that the company must then send to the tax
authorities. The fee will be very
high! But must we weep for the employee? No! He
still has a lot of stock!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if this is a private company? There’s no
public market for the stock! What
happens? Once in a while, the company
will have enough money to buy the employee’s option out for what it’s worth,
after withholding taxes. The employee
pays taxes and the company gets the deductions. So options work well for public companies, but for private companies
that will stay private they are a bad idea. If the employee is rich enough to exercise the option, they will, but
that’s rare.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
there’s yet another case! Private
companies often want to go public. Say a
private company goes public after six years and they sell several billion
dollars’ worth of stock in an IPO. After
the IPO, the underwriter will restrict the sale of the stock for nine months. The employee will have to clear the sale with
the boss, too.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>With
options and convertibles, you need to be concerned about dilution of the common
stock. If there are $5 billion in
outstanding convertible debentures and you can convert 10 shares for each 100
debentures, and your stock is selling for $60, the stock will get really
diluted when the debenture holders convert!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Lastly,
in terms of accounting, companies may, if they wish, may value the option upon
its issue and treat it as an expense when issued for accounting purposes. This is done by lots of the country’s big
companies! These are companies that use
options “some, but not that much”. With high
tech companies, the options are spread around much more liberally. Microsoft spreads its options to janitors,
for example. In the future, all
companies may be required to value their options when they are granted and take
an expense deduction on their income statement. The FASB (<span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>faz</span></span><span
class=GramE>-bee,</span> or the Financial Accounting Standards Board) is a
not-for-profit organization that sets <span class=SpellE>GAAPs</span>
(generally accepted accounting principles). FASB must be consistent with what the SEC says. But the SEC generally defers to the FASB when
setting <span class=SpellE>GAAPs</span>. Occasionally, the SEC will step in, and “once in a blue moon” Congress
will step in and alter the rules.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Consider
a company that bunched up a lot of options in a high executive. The executive goes to the board of directors
and asks for permission to transfer his options to the working stiffs to make
them happier so the company can make money. Shipman thinks this is a smart move.</span></p>

Court. For subsistence alimony (which is

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>when performed</i>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
family law enters into business associations in a big way! In this case and <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wilderman</i></span>, we see that if you’re
a Sub C corporation, the Internal Revenue Service is always bugging you on the
issue of reasonableness of salaries. In <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wilderman</i></span>, the Internal
Revenue Service found that what the husband was getting was unreasonable. Thus, they disallowed many of the
deductions. For a public company, the
same rule applies <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in theory</i>. In practice, however, it doesn’t so apply
because public companies hire <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>compensation
consultants</i> who have access to the earnings of corporate executives. Also, the federal income tax statutes
regulate, and if you meet those technical requirements, you’re
capitalized. Most public companies have
a majority of their directors as outside, independent directors. The Internal Revenue Service, as a practical
matter, usually doesn’t challenge the independence of directors of public
companies. For private companies, there
is constant friction of § 162(a), and that’s a big reason they go with Sub S or
a limited liability company. If you’re
an LLC or Sub S, the issue of excessive compensation doesn’t arise because
there is a flow-through.</span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><b><i

<br/>

<p><span>This
is a two shareholder corporation. The
husband worked for the father when the father ran the company. When the husband married the wife, the father
turned in his stock certificate and two stock certificates were issued to the
husband and wife. There were two
directors: he and she. The marriage and business
went well for some time. The husband was
a good worker and a fine businessman. The salary scale was set at the company by the fact that the husband was
doing most of the work. He made himself
the President and CEO, and made his wife the “inside person”, doing the books
and records. As long as the marriage
goes well, it’s not a big deal, but the marriage goes sour. It’s a deadlock! The board of directors had two members, and
they disagreed! Could there be an
election of a new board of directors by the shareholders? No, because the stock was split 50-50! It’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>classic</i>
deadlock situation!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
facts were on the husband’s side? There’s
a corporate rule that officers are elected for a term: one year and “for so
much longer as is needed until a replacement or successor is elected”. Therefore, they both remained directors and
he remained the CEO. What’s the other
big piece of paper in any business transaction? It’s the bank signature card! Shipman
thinks that the bank signature cards said that either person could write checks
on behalf of the corporation. Shipman
thinks that the wife wrote her own check to herself at the old, low scale, and
then the husband declared as CEO that he was worth a lot more than when the
board of directors had last passed on it! <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He started paying himself a lot
more! Under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law, the wife could go and
get a custodian appointed and she could also bring a shareholder derivative
action.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, there is no statutory
provision for a custodian. We do have,
however, case law that is favorable to the wife if this were an </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> corporation: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby v. Beam</i>, which is “a case of
almost constitutional dimensions”. It
holds that if there is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>true close corporation</i>
then (1) the fiduciary duties between the parties are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>intense</i>, (2) the courts will give relief promptly and (3) the suit
can be broadly either as a derivative action, or bypassing Rule 23.1, which is
good for plaintiffs.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
here are the holdings of the present case: (1) <span class=GramE>Only</span>
the board of directors can set the salary for officers and top executive employees. (2) If there is a deadlock, the president
(with check signing authority) can continue to pay himself under the last pay
scale approved by the board, including any bonuses.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Dodge v. Ford
Motor Co.</span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
case holds that (1) with regard to a close <span class=GramE>corporation,</span>
any shareholder can sue the corporation and the directors directly to force a
declaration of dividends. This doesn’t
have to be a derivative action. (2) The
action of the directors in not declaring dividends is under the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>deference rule of business judgment</i>. If the defendants can show business judgment,
the plaintiff must show one of these things: (1) arbitrariness, (2) ultra <span
class=SpellE>vires</span>, (3) illegality, (4) waste, (5) bad faith, (6) gross negligence
in procedure or (7) gross negligence on the merits. The last two are the biggies!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here,
the Dodge brothers, who were minority shareholders in this closely-held company
run by Ford, were able to show gross negligence on the merits. How? The company was making lots of money, and more every year. The company was rolling in dough!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
what did the court say? Correctly,
according to Shipman, the court ruled that there existed a cause of action and
if you can show gross negligence then you can get the court to force the
company to grant dividends. But the court
is reluctant to draft these sorts of orders.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
on the other hand, they make fun of Henry Ford for lowering the price of his
cars as demand was growing. Ford didn’t
have a lot of formal education, and the high <span class=SpellE>falutin</span>’
lawyers made fun of him. The answer is a
simple economic principle: a healthy company wants to push the price down if
possible because it helps create a barrier to the entry of competitors! If you have a good product and you sell it
cheaper and cheaper, then it will be harder and harder to raise capital to go
head-to-head with you.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, there is also <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>In re Estate of <span class=SpellE>Byrum</span></i>,
an estate tax case. It came after
1970. It was written by Justice
Powell. This case involved both the federal
estate tax and </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law in regard to
dividends. What’s the federal estate
tax? There are two important federal
taxes: the federal tax on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gifts</i>, tied
to a related tax on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>estates</i>. The estate tax can run up to 55%, and the gift
tax can run high too. There are
exceptions, though: transfers between spouses are exempted from both
taxes. (About nine states have these
taxes, too, and many states have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inheritance</i>
taxes, which are similar to estate taxes. </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, on the other hand, has neither. They want to encourage old, wealthy people to
move there! But they tax all kinds of
weird stuff other than income and wealth!) This is a big deal for tax planning for the wealthy. Note that the exemptions are up to about $1.3
million. Most people don’t have to
worry. Recently, the exemption was only
$600,000. Technically, the estate tax is
<span class=GramE>begin</span> phased out. The gift tax will stay, “or else the income tax will be gutted”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
what’s the situation in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Byrum</i></span>? This guy owned a lot of the stock of a close corporation. He gave away some to children, but kept 60%
for himself so he could run the company. According to the Internal Revenue Code, if you transfer property with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>retained major powers </i>over that property,
then at your death, the property is in your estate even though you transferred
it to your kids. The government argued
that since the old man was going to set the dividend policy on the companies he
maintained a major power over the transferred minority shares. Justice Powell went through </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
 >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> law and found statements
that there was a heavy fiduciary duty of majority shareholders in all matters, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>including dividends</i>. Thus, because the fiduciary duty was so
strong, the old man had <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> retained
a major power over the stock that was transferred to the kids. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Crosby
v. Beam</i> would agree with Justice Powell. This is very relevant stuff!</span></p>

<p><span>What
about a public company? Can you get a
court order for a dividend there? In
theory yes, but in practice, “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>forget it,
baby!</i>” But the situation with a
public company isn’t as bad if there are no dividends. For example, Microsoft pays no dividends, but
their shares are highly liquid. But with
a close corporation, your shares are not very alienable and not very liquid!</span></p>

<p><span>This
deals with the deductibility of interest. It’s governed by §§ 162 and 163 of the Internal Revenue Code. § 163 <span class=GramE>sets</span> forth a
threefold test:</span></p>

<br/>

<p style='margin-left:37.5pt;text-indent:-19.5pt;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;
tab-stops:list 37.5pt'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>There are a lot of technical
rules in § 163 that must be mastered. First: you can’t make a public issue of debt securities payable to the
bearer. There must be a name on it! Outside the English-speaking world, that’s
done to screw the tax authorities! But
here, you can’t screw around with the tax authorities. If you issue debt to the public, you can’t
make it payable to the bearer. There
must be a name on there so the Internal Revenue Service can trace just who got
the interest. But this doesn’t apply to
private issuances of debt.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:37.5pt;text-indent:-19.5pt;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;
tab-stops:list 37.5pt'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>Most public issuances of
debt have to be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>registered</i>. It’s sort of like the previous rule: there
must be a bond registry maintained by the company.</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:37.5pt;text-indent:-19.5pt;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;
tab-stops:list 37.5pt'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><![endif]><span>The debt must be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>classic debt in form</i>. There must be definitely amounts of principal
and interest required to be paid at specified times, even if there is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>no income!</i></span></p>

<p style='margin-left:37.5pt;text-indent:-19.5pt;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;
tab-stops:list 37.5pt'><![if !supportLists]><span><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>(4)<span

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>de facto equity</i>. With
closely held, Sub C corporations, as in <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Slappey</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Drive</i>, the
shareholders who were also creditors did not force the company to pay interest
and principal on time. The court held
that this is sloppy, and the company shouldn’t be allowed the interest
deduction.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
practice, if a public company meets the first two qualifications, the court won’t
go to the de facto equity test. How else
can you deal with this? You can avoid it
completely by electing Sub S. A Sub S
corporation is a flow-through. <span
class=GramE>As long as the debt is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>straight
debt in form</i> (“the Pat Robertson rule”), no sweat.</span> The other way to avoid the problem is with an
LLC, governed by Sub K, and thus it’s flow-through and you don’t get into the
de facto equity or unreasonable salary problems (with an exception to be
mentioned tomorrow). But one of the big
selling points of a Sub S or LLC is that you avoid the unreasonable salaries
and de facto equity tests. If you’re Sub
C these days, you can still have problems with those areas! Watch out for the Internal Revenue Service
agents!</span></p>

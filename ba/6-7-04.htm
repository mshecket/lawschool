<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Ohio rule regarding
the disregard of the corporate fiction</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>If you go back 25 years, the Ohio
Supreme Court cases had all held that you need fraud or sham to disregard the corporate
fiction.  Since then, a Sixth Circuit case and an Ohio Supreme Court case that
expanded the grounds somewhat for disregarding the corporate fiction.  After
that, you see a bunch of Ohio Court of Appeals opinions.  These opinions
differ, some saying that Ohio law is now pretty much like the law of any other jurisdiction,
others saying that the two big cases did not open things up that broadly.  A
third group of cases have given an extensive definition to <i>fraud</i> and
have included constructive and equitable fraud along with “hardcore” legal
fraud.  So in Ohio you’ll have to read a bunch of cases and carefully qualify
the extent of the opinions you give to clients because no one is completely
sure where Ohio law is right now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Preemptive rights in Ohio</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Courts used to say that there
were preemptive rights in Ohio unless the charter provided otherwise.  A few
years ago, the statute was amended as to newly formed corporations.  Now we
have an “opt-in” situation rather than an “opt-out” situation.  You don’t have statutory
preemptive rights unless the charter so provides.  Delaware has always been an
opt-in state in modern times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Generally, if new stock in a corporation
is issued, it must be offered to all shareholders on a proportional basis.  But
there are common law exceptions.  The big case in Ohio on preemptive rights is <i>Barsan
v. Pioneer</i>.  It follows the Massachusetts authority.  This case made a
point about <i>waiver</i>.  Shareholder by shareholder, there can be a waiver. 
If all shareholders waive, then there is no problem.  The waiver can be formal
(in writing), or it can be informal (by conduct).  That’s one common law
exception.  Next up comes non-cash property.  When stock is issued for non-cash
property, meaning a corporation wants to issue common stock to a non-shareholder
in exchange for some property owned by that non-shareholder.  Shipman doesn’t
know how this exception is consistent with the rationale for preemptive
rights!  When a company makes a non-only purchase of another company, that’s
non-cash property and will also fit within the common law exceptions. 
Preemptive rights are a <i>sticky issue</i>!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Generally, when public
companies go public in an opt-out state, they will often amend their articles
to deny preemptive rights.  That can be done under Ohio law, and no appraisal
right is involved.  Considering the problems posed by preemptive rights, few Ohio
lawyers organizing a new company in the old days opted out in the original
charter.  Shipman finds this interesting.  He thinks this will change with the “opt-in”
situation.  If you have preemptive rights you can have problems!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In Ohio, preemptive rights
are dealt with in R.C. 1701.14-.20.  In older Ohio companies, there generally
won’t be an opt-out, and the change won’t apply to a company established before
the change.  The common law exceptions are actually built into R.C. 1701.14
along with some other exceptions.  This section says that if you’re subject to
preemptive rights, you can, without a shareholder’s meeting and without a
charter amendment, “bless” the transaction if you get shareholders owning
two-thirds or more of the stock to say that preemptive rights will not apply to
that transaction.  Note that if you do that, you must immediately notify all shareholders
of what you’ve done.  Also, this provision exists “on top of” the common law
waiver provision.  Preemptive rights can exist by contract among the shareholders. 
There are a number of cases where, when you deal you a close corporation, you
find that there is a shareholders’ voting agreement (per R.C. 1701.591) that
has contractual preemptive rights provisions in it.  There are situations where
the shareholders want the proportionate ownership kept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This affects lawyers in a big
way!  Lawyers are often called upon to issue the opinion that stock is “duly
and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and non-assessable”.  Does this
opinion include “no violation of anybody’s preemptive rights”?  There’s
disagreement on this point!  Careful lawyers for purchasers request a second
paragraph that says: “Issuance of the stock does not contravene anybody’s
preemptive rights under the charter, the statute, or any contract or agreement”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Here’s an example: in the
first merger, all the shareholders voted yes, but the lawyer forgot to amend
the articles to take out preemptive rights.  Down the road, under new
management, they didn’t realize that preemptive rights were still there.  They
sued the lawyer in the first transaction, and Shipman argues that the lawyer’s
opinion was correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Hyman v. Velsicol Corp.</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This is an old case with a
lot of lessons for us.  There was an Illinois corporation, two capitalists, and
one sweat equity.  It was a start up, and everyone put in an equal amount of
cash.  With start-ups, you’ll need more money down the road!  You’ll seldom
make it on the first infusion of money.  The company needed more money.  The
two capitalists owned two-thirds of the stock and were two of the three
directors.  The board of directors authorized the corporation to sell a <i>huge</i>
number of new shares for a <i>huge </i>amount of money.  The company was under
preemptive rights.  Each shareholder was notified of his right to subscribe to
a third of the offering at the stipulated price.  The two capitalists, who
planned the issue, had the money for their one-third.  But sweat equity didn’t
have the money!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>So sweat equity sues under
the theory of fiduciary duties.  The two capitalists were technically complying
with preemptive rights.  If sweat equity could have afforded it he could have
exercised his right to buy one-third of the new shares.  Preemptive rights
doesn’t displace fiduciary duties!  In a close corporation, the officers,
directors, and controlling shareholders owe <i>strong</i> fiduciary duties to
each other.  In Ohio, <i>Crosby v. Bing</i> codifies that doctrine.  So sweat
equity asks for an injunction stopping the issue because he has no money and
after the issue he’ll only own a few percent of the enterprise.  We’re told
that the injunction was denied, but we don’t get all the facts.  Sweat equity
came into court with unclean hands!  Those who seek equity must do equity! 
Sweat equity had gone to work for a competitor and the Illinois court held that
under the unclean hands doctrine there was no relief on the fiduciary duty
theory.  The capitalists “kissed the books” correctly on the preemptive rights
doctrine!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What other lessons can we
draw from this case?  If you represent a sweat equity type and the startup is
in corporate form, sweat equity will want a clause saying: “If new money is
needed for capitalist, they will advance it for preferred stock that is not
participating or voting, or else they will advance it as debt.”  In a high-tech
startup, sweat equity wants to be a major owner when the enterprise goes
public.  This will entail <i>heavy bargaining</i>, but keep in mind what sweat
equity’s point is.  If the startup is in a limited liability company, the
problem is going to be there, but it will be much less acute.  The contractual
provisions protecting sweat equity while dealing with the capitalists can be
dealt with a lot more easily as an LLC with the Internal Revenue Code.  LLCs
are very good for startup ventures in that Sub K is simply more flexible than
Sub C or Sub S.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>An agent can get
indemnification from the principal if four conditions are met:</span></p>

express work rule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Uniform Partnership Act
of 1914 codifies this rule at § 18.  The leading case on the rule is a Pennsylvania
trial court case from the 1800s called <i>D’Arcy</i>, in which a Pennsylvania
principal sent his agent down to Haiti, and through no fault of the agent, he
got thrown in jail and he had to litigate.  The agent finally got out of jail
and back to Pennsylvania, where he sued the principal for indemnification for
the litigation expenses.  It was held that he made out the case and would be
entitled to indemnification even though he had no contract for indemnification
with the principal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>That’s the rule as of 1930.  Then,
in <i>McCollum</i>, a New York trial court case from about 1940 shocked the corporate
world!  McCollum was an executive of a company that’s now part of ExxonMobil.  In
the 1930’s, a number of the oil companies engaged in fixing the price of oil. 
There were large downward pressures on oil and many of the company did “naughty
things” in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  The government brought a
lot of cases and got a lot of convictions.  But when they brought the criminal
case against McCollum, he paid the expenses out of his own pocket and got an
acquittal.  Then he asked his employer for indemnification, but the employer
refused and he sued based on the common law principle of agency law.  This case
added a <i>fifth</i> requirement to those on the board: McCollum didn’t show
any benefit to the employer, and therefore he couldn’t get indemnified!  Some
states refused to follow McCollum.  They followed the “classic statement”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>After World War II, statutes
came about like R.C. 1701.13(E).  In Delaware, it’s § 144.  In Ohio, if you’re
sued in your corporate capacity either by or on behalf of the corporation or by
a third party and you prevail on the merits or otherwise (such as based on statute
of limitations), then you are <i>absolutely entitled </i>to indemnification
from the company.  This doesn’t mean you don’t have to have insurance.  Insurance
and indemnification don’t completely overlap.  Your rights under
indemnification are no better than the solvency of the corporation.  But if you
have an insurance policy that covers you, then the insolvency of the company
you work for doesn’t affect your insurance coverage, assuming, of course, that
your insurance company is solvent.  Therefore, your R.C. 1701.13(E)(3) right
against a corporation might not be worth much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>R.C. 1701.13(E)(5)(b) says
that if you’re sued in your corporate capacity, the board of directors <i>may</i>
advance your attorney’s fees.  R.C. 1701.13(E)(1) talks about suits <i>by</i>
or <i>on behalf of </i>the company, while R.C. 1701.13(E)(2) talks about third
party suits including shareholder actions, creditor actions, actions under the
securities laws, and actions under criminal provisions.  Both statutes say that
other certain circumstances, the board of directors <i>may</i> indemnify you. 
(E)(1) and (E)(2) do not have any “<i>must</i>” language in them.  But here’s
the new kid on the block from the 1980’s: R.C. 1701.13(E)(5)(a), which also
deals with attorney’s fees.  This is a “<i>must</i>” provision.  If you’re sued
in your corporate capacity and you make a demand on the company, the company<i>
must</i> pay your reasonable attorney’s fees monthly subject to one <i>big</i>
condition: you must sign a written undertaking to <i>reasonably</i> <i>cooperate</i>,
and if you are found to have been reckless in discharging your duties, you will
have to reimburse the corporation for such attorney’s fees advanced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the 1980’s, we also got
R.C. 1701.59(D) and 1701.59(F).  (D) provides that in an action <i>by </i>or <i>on
behalf of </i>the corporation against you, if you were acting in your corporate
capacity, no money damages will be awarded unless you are found to have been reckless. 
(D) applies only to <i>directors</i>, and the same is true of .13(E)(5)(a),
except Shipman thinks that the latter applies to a director <i>acting as an
officer</i> and it may turn out that .59(D) also does.  R.C. 1701.59(F) makes
it clear that (D) does not apply to a suit against a director in his capacity
as a <i>controlling shareholder</i>.  We’ll get back to the duties of
controlling shareholders later.  The infamous Delaware case of <i>Smith v. Van Gorkum</i>
brought about these statutes.  The Delaware statute differs somewhat from the Ohio
provisions.  For the Delaware provisions to apply, the shareholders must vote
it in, but in Ohio it’s just the opposite: they apply unless the shareholders
vote it out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Merritt-Chapman &amp;
Scott Corp. v. Wolfson</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Wolfson was a “corporate bad
boy” of the 1960’s and 1970’s.  He was the director of a public company and the
federal government claimed that he violated the securities laws, so they
brought a criminal action against him in two or three trials.  He won on some
of the counts, but the government won on some other counts.  Other charges were
dropped as the case went along.  The question is how the Delaware version of (E)(3)
worked.  The decision is very pro-director.  The court held that:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>You can prevail in different ways:
either by acquittal or by a second trial where the government drops a charge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>It is not all-or-nothing, that is,
Wolfson should allocate his legal expenses among the various counts and as to
the allocated expenses, to those counts where he prevailed, he is entitled to
indemnification.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The Justice Department, in
its sentencing guidelines, wants corporations <i>not</i> to indemnify, and the
pressure is on corporations to cut loose accused executives and <i>stomp</i> on
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Director and officer’s liability
insurance is important.  If you’re advising a client, don’t go on a board
without it.  Look at the coverage and exclusion clauses of the insurance
policy.  Coverage clauses are usually construed broadly to protect the insured,
and exclusion clauses are generally construed narrowly against the insurer. 
What are some of the big provisions?  In the exclusion clauses, you’ll find
exclusions for <i>dishonesty</i>, <i>fraud</i>, <i>criminal conduct</i>, and <i>intentionality</i>. 
Just what is intentionality?  In Delaware § 102, we’re told that these new
clauses can apply only to actions under the fiduciary duty of care and not
under the fiduciary duty of loyalty.  Ohio R.C. 1701.59(D) and .13(E)(5)(a) don’t
make that distinction.  The courts have held that if the action is a duty of
loyalty action against a director or officer, and all that’s shown at trial is <i>inadvertent</i>
breach of the duty of loyalty, Delaware § 102 will apply.  Shipman thinks that
the same rule applies here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>What’s another big
exclusion?  One is Rule 10(b)(5) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
ERISA is also an exclusion.  The biggest headache is a clause that says: “If
the director or officer received some corporate benefit that other shareholders
did not receive in proportion to their stock holding, then the policy will not
apply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This gets us into the way
policies have been drafted for the last 35 years.  In the old days, the
policies were written as <i>occurrence</i> policies.  If you bought a policy
for the calendar year 2004 but you didn’t get sued until 2010 under a discovery
rule, that occurrence policy would cover you.  But the problem with this type
of policy from the insurance companies’ standpoint is that it has a <i>long
tail</i>; the insurance companies can’t figure out how much they’re on the hook
for.  So about thirty years ago, the insurance companies switched to <i>claims
made</i> policies.  Today, your D &amp; O policy will cover you for <i>claims made
</i>in 2004 with two additions, one going backward and one going forward: (1)
if you notify the insurer in 2004 of something that may give rise to a claim
and the claim is made later, then the 2004 policy will cover you.  (2) If you’re
buying a policy from the company for the first time in 2004, things that you
fully disclose in detail to them that happened earlier can, for an <i>additional
premium</i>, be covered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>When a professional retires,
they purchase <i>tail coverage</i>.  Tail coverage will cover things that come
up in the future.  The premium will usually be one and one half to three times
your usual annual premium.  The application for tail coverage or for looking
backwards is going to have a <i>very</i> complete disclosure provision in it. 
The insured and the insurance company must deal with each other in <i>utmost
good faith</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>McCullough v. Fidelity
&amp; Deposit Co.</span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>This case dealt with a bank
that had generally informed its insurance company that there had been a bank
examination.  If the insurance company had read the full examiner’s report,
they would have seen that a bunch of claims were about to break loose.  The
court held that in order for the “forward looking” out to apply, you must be
specific and detailed in your reporting to the insurance company.  Shipman says
that McCullough should have hired a lawyer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Here’s one more situation
where you can get your attorneys’ fees.  The outside legal counsel for a corporation
is asked to review a proposed merger in detail.  He does so using reasonable
care and he gives a written opinion to the directors and officers that, in his
opinion, neither federal nor state antitrust statutes are violated by the
transaction.  Three years later, the Justice Department sues the corporation
and the officers and directors claiming that it <i>does</i> violate the
antitrust laws.  The outside lawyer in that situation will recommend to the
board that he enter an appearance for both the corporation and the directors
and officers because he advised <i>all</i> of them that in his opinion he
thought it was legal.  He would say that because he advised <i>everyone</i>
that way, there is no conflict of interest.  What he is trying to fight is the government
strategy, which is to <i>divide and conquer</i>.  It is perfectly proper for
the outside counsel to make an appearance for everyone and handle the litigation
since they were proceeding on his authority.  The board of directors will go
along with this and allow it.  It’s not literally covered by .13, but it is a
form of indemnification of attorneys’ fees that happens <i>every day</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Connected with that and
relevant to today’s discussion is the defense of <i>good faith reliance</i> <i>on
legal counsel</i>.  Here are the leading authorities on this: <i>Maness v.
Myers</i> from the U.S. Supreme Court, which deals with the lawyer’s side.  The
client was selling “girlie” magazines.  But were they hardcore pornography or
not?  In a civil proceeding, the government asked for the production of the
magazine, and the lawyer advised him against it.  There was a court hearing,
and the judge asked the client why he didn’t submit, and he said that his
lawyer gave him a legal opinion that he didn’t have to.  The judge issued a
contempt order for the lawyer, and the U.S. Supreme Court held that insofar as
the lawyer is concerned, if you give advice to a client in good faith that
precludes recklessness, then a court has no jurisdiction to enter a contempt
order against you under the Sixth Amendment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Here are a couple of journal
articles.  One article in the Vanderbilt Law Review by Hawes said that when
there is reasonable reliance on counsel by a client, it proves good faith and
reasonable care by the client.  But there are causes of action where you can
lose even if you’re not negligent and you’re in good faith.  But the role of
the lawyer in this area in giving opinions is crucial.  Under Delaware § 102,
if there is an inadvertent breach of the duty of loyalty, you can get
protection.  If people have relied on reasonable advice of counsel, then they’re
okay too.  But sometimes clients hold back key facts from their lawyer.  Also,
the lawyer’s opinion will often tell them that something is legal if you do these
four things, but then in the real world, clients will thumb their nose at one
of the things and only do three things.  The things may be very onerous!  But
the role of lawyers is crucial.  So is the role of CPAs.  If you have a truly
independent CPA and you disclose everything to her and she comes back with what
looks like a reasonable statement, and you have fully disclosed and her
credentials and reputation are good, then they’ll have trouble getting at you. 
This will be an issue in the Enron case.</span></p>

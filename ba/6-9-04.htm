          When would common law remedies be the best? It�s more often than you
          think! In a recent big Ohio case out of Cleveland, a discount broker
          then known as <span class="SpellE">Olde</span> &amp; Co. This firm was
          a member of the NYSE. The issue involved
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">suitability</i>. Under the
          federal securities laws, a securities broker must avoid recommending
          unsuitable securities to purchasers. There is a remedy under Rule
          10(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>5). Under 10(b<span class="GramE"
            >)(</span
          >5), it is only if the customer proves that the recommendation was
          made with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">scienter</i>. That�s
          hardcore. In the case, a </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Cleveland</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          resident was recommended certain securities by
          <span class="SpellE">Olde</span>, and they went south. The customer
          said that given his precarious financial position, they should not
          have recommended a speculative security. If he had sued under
          10(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>5), it would have had to go to
          federal court because the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 says that
          all actions under the Act must be in federal court (which is different
          from the other federal securities statutes). Why is that significant?
          Over the last 25 years, many federal judges have become more
          anti-plaintiff on securities cases. The state courts have remained
          more neutral. So the guy wanted to sue in county common pleas
          court.</span

          that every member must �know thy customer�. The primary purpose of the
          rule is to protect the member firm. If a customer doesn�t buy up after
          he buys, the member firm is responsible to the party on the other side
          of the transaction. The court held that under </span

          know why they didn�t do so here! In arbitration, suitability claims
          under 10(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>5) require scienter, at least
          in theory. But in practice, arbitrators will often give recovery for
          mere <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">negligence</i> on the part
          of the broker-dealer firm regarding suitability. On the other hand,
          studies of all massive arbitration system, like the securities system,
          indicate that arbitrators tend not to give lavish or large awards.
          They cut down on the amount. They�re more liberal in giving the

          the deal with the Martin Act? Under the federal securities laws, the
          courts and some statutes have said that the SEC can get

          misconduct, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">but </i>nearly all

          faith. He doesn�t have to prove scienter. Because of that power,
          Spitzer has been the main person pushing through settlements in the

        <span

          affiliate of the company, stock which you purchase through the
          organized trading markets will be exempt. For example, I�m contacted
          by Johnson in Dayton who is a physician. Three months ago, he bought
          GM stock, registered in his own name, through the NYSE. He is not a
          director or officer of GM. Neither is his wife or any other relative.
          He doesn�t meet the 10% rule, which is the third way you can be an
          affiliate. If you add up the GM stock all of his family owns, it�s
          still well under 10% of the shares outstanding. Insofar as the
          Securities Act of 1933 is concerned, he has a 4(1) exemption. Insofar
          as </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span> law is concerned, R.C. 1707.02(E) exempts him.</span>

        <span

          exchange. Can he legally make a non-distribution? Yes, in theory. The
          SEC says that the term �distribution� in 2(11) equals �non-public

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>All
agents are fiduciaries to their principals.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No fiduciary, including an agent or a director, may, by contract with a
third party limit his fiduciary duties to the beneficiary of that fiduciary
relationship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case that sets out
this rule is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ConAgra v. Cargill</i> from
the Nebraska Supreme Court from the 1980’s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Delaware Supreme Court agrees with this case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>X, Inc. was approached by Z, Inc., which said
to the board of X, Inc. that they wanted to buy all or substantially all of
their assets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They proposed to assume
all of their disclosed, <span class=SpellE>noncontingent</span>, and
uncontested liabilities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In many states,
that might be considered a de facto merger, but </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> does not recognize de facto
mergers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We also don’t have to worry
about that because it was a cash offer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The federal securities laws and state Blue Sky laws are inapplicable, at
least as far as the Securities Act of 1933 goes, because it’s an all-cash offer
in U.S. dollars.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could the officers
themselves approve such a thing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statutes
in all states on this transaction specify a two-step transaction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The directors of the selling corporation must
approve and call a special shareholders’ meeting and a specified majority or
supermajority of all the shareholders must approve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
directors of X, Inc. met with the people from Z, Inc. and said: “Let’s go!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They approved the contract offered by Z, Inc.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But notice that the contract is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in limbo</i> and not effective until the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shareholders</i> of X, Inc. approve it at a
meeting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The contract included language saying
that the directors of X, Inc. agreed to put the matter before the shareholders
of X, Inc. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and </i>“support [the offer],
if consistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors of X, Inc.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, a second suitor, B, Inc., comes along
and talks to the directors of X, Inc., saying that it will offer what it thinks
is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>better deal</i> by a cash tender
offer to all shareholders of X, Inc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>B
says: “How’s about it?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The directors
did so, and of course, it screwed up the shareholders’ meeting called to
approve the Z, Inc. offer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Z, Inc.
brings an action against both B, Inc. and all directors of X that in effect
says: “I’ve been unjustly used as a ‘stalking horse’!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I’ve been used to make the main horse run
faster!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The directors backed out of their word!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Give us money and/or an injunction!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The case <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>should</i>
have gone off on contract principles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The language phoned in to the X directors to put in the contract was
standard and it says: “if the fiduciary duties of the X, Inc. directors cause
them to change their mind, they can do so legally.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Why?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Here’s
a big deal:</i> the Nebraska Supreme Court chose not to go by contract but rather
by an agency principal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They said that if
the X, Inc. directors collectively held all or nearly all of the stock of X,
Inc., the principal would not buy because substantially all stock would have
consented to an alternate arrangement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(Note that creditors have nothing to fear.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> courts have picked this up
in the case of </span><st1:City><st1:place><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Paramount</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><span

  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> expressly approved <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ConAgra v. Cargill</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So what’s a lock-up?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s unclear in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> exactly what you can do for
a lock-up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Probably you can have a
clause saying that if the deal doesn’t go through, Z, Inc. will be reimbursed
for its legal, accounting, investment banking and similar expenses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is called a “modest breakup fee”
clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In states <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>other than</i> </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>, such a clause is
valid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some people have tried to go
further and include “massive breakup fees”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In one recent case, there was a merger involving $50-60 billion where
the breakup fee was to the tune of $4-5 billion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was paid, and there was no suit over it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
Z, Inc.-type businesses of the world can negotiate an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

price.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> court said that this can be
done within limits, but you can’t allow the person to make a killing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the stock is at 30, you can grant Z an
option for 20% of the stock, except if the stock of X goes over, for example,
40, then you can’t allow them that particular benefit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 2003 in the <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Omnicare</i></span> case, there was a
decision that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>boggles the mind!</i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was from the Delaware Supreme Court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You had a situation where about three shareholders
of X, Inc. owned, collectively, 60%.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
vote in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
'> to approve a transaction is only a simple majority
of all outstanding shares.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>, this often goes up to
2/3rds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Z, Inc. contracted with the
three directors who held 60% and got a promise from them in their individual
capacity that they would vote to approve the deal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>B, Inc. entered and made a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>much</i> better offer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Z brought an action against the directors in
their individual and corporate capacities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Delaware Supreme Court held that even though these three people were
contracting in their individual capacity concerning their stock, it still was
an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>impermissible lock-up</i> under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> law.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a 3-2 decision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The opinion said that if the directors, in
their individual capacity, had put the language in similar to what the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Houston</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> lawyer put in as in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ConAgra v. Cargill</i>, that is, that they
would vote as shareholders to support <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>consistent
with their fiduciary duties as directors</i>, <span class=GramE>then</span> it
probably would have been okay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is
a </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Minnesota</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> case that was not as picky
on lock-ups.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have no idea what the
situation would be here in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Here’s
another big agency and fiduciary principle: no fiduciary may <i

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Within a law firm, for example, a senior
partner conducts an interview and assures the potential client that they will
be treated right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They will be
introduced to the associates and told up front that the associates will do most
of the work under his supervision.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If he
is a noted trial lawyer but he isn’t going to try the case, you put that into
writing early on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If your firm takes a

that with the client in writing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;'> insurance company.<span

contract with C, whereby C was going to run everything.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The company went insolvent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When an insurance company goes insolvent, the
state insurance commissioner goes to a state court and they take over the
company’s assets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Creditors file
claims.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A claim was filed by C for compensation
for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>future</i> under the contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This did not involve past, paid
compensation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The past compensation was
reasonable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no fraud.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>C had been doing his job.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Seventh Circuit held that this was a
highly unreasonable delegation by the board of directors of its functions, and
therefore the future portion of the contract was unenforceable and C would take
nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today, if you’re going to have
a contract like this, the lawyer will (1) research carefully and keep the contract
reasonable in length, (2) reword it to say: “I, C, will give advice to the board
of directors, which advice they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>may or
may not</i> take in their own discretion”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as “confession of judgment” clauses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
are they?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In around 15 states, these
clauses were routine both in consumer and commercial transactions.<span

style='font-size:14.0pt;'> and most American states,
they were quickly ruled against public policy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Near the end of a contract, it would say: “I, the maker, do hereby appoint
any licensed attorney in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>In
the 1970’s, the U.S. Supreme Court took up two cases in the 1970’s under the Fourteenth

  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> case that reached the Supreme
Court, the <span class=SpellE>cognovit</span> clause was in a commercial
contract between two businessmen each separately represented by independent
lawyers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Evidence was also presented to
the Court that the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> practice was that one the <span
class=SpellE>cognovit</span> judgment had been entered, if the maker had a good
defense, <span class=GramE>then</span> he could usually move for a new trial
and move to set aside the <span class=SpellE>cognovit</span> judgment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once you get that judgment, you can get a
writ of execution and levy on whatever that guy has.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Supreme Court ruled in two cases that, at
least in a commercial transaction between sophisticated people, the practice <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>does not</i> violate the Fourteenth
Amendment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the two cases came an
FTC rule outlawing <span class=SpellE>cognovit</span> clauses in <i

  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> statute did two things: (1)
it outlawed the clauses as to consumer paper, similar to the FTC rule, and (2)
it set out a full-caps legend that must be typed verbatim into the note.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>These

style='font-size:14.0pt;'>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is this agency law?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s an agency coupled with an interest; note
the drafting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if Mr. Smith goes
crazy after signing the commercial <span class=SpellE>cognovit</span>
note?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under standard agency rules, insanity
automatically terminates any power of attorney or any agency.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the courts have held that if you
have a <span class=SpellE>cognovit</span> note stated to be irrevocable and
coupled with an interest then that rule will not apply.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Mr. Smith gives a <span class=SpellE>cognivit</span>
note in a commercial transaction to Huntington Bank and then goes insane,
Huntington Bank can still use it against him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But what if Mr. Smith dies?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The standard
agency rule is that the death of a principal terminates agency even if neither
agent nor third party knows of the death.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There is an old U.S. Supreme Court case written by Chief Justice
Marshall so holding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most states follow
that, even as to <span class=SpellE>cognovit</span> notes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Cognovit</span> notes have
two big problems: (1) the death problem, and (2) the lawyer for the creditor
can’t sign it; you must find someone who is not a lawyer for the debtor <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>or</i> the creditor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s very difficult to get people to sign it
because it’s too much of a grey area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;'> and the states where <span
class=SpellE>cognovit</span> notes are used, people put <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>too much trust</i> in them as a good security device.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, if you’re a small supplier
asked to supply 100,000 units to a small manufacturer, unsecured, you can use
the <span class=SpellE>cognovit</span> note, but you should keep in mind that
institutional creditors such as banks and insurance companies are ahead of you
with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>recorded first mortgages</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <span class=SpellE>cognovit</span> clause
will help you collect a little bit, but not a lot.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the other hand, if you’re a debtor with a
lot of power, don’t agree with the <span class=SpellE>cognovit</span>
clause!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The judgment can get on the
record in two hours, but it can take two years to get out of it!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The problem is that it is very difficult for
debtors or lessees to avoid the <span class=SpellE>cognovit</span> clauses in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>One
more bit about agency: the problems that have talked about death and insanity revoking
powers of attorney have caused problems for a long time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In World War II, nearly every state enacted a
“Servicemen’s Statute”, providing that if you were a serviceman, you executed a
power of attorney before you went to fight overseas, you told your spouse to
sell <span class=SpellE>Greenacre</span>, your spouse negotiated with Mr. X to
sell <span class=SpellE>Greenacre</span>, and a contract was signed, then if
neither the spouse nor Mr. X knew that the serviceman had been killed before
the contract was signed, the contract would still be binding.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At common law, before these statutes, that
was not the result; the contract would not have been binding.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On big deals, then and now, the third party
dealing with the serviceman will insist that the serviceperson transfer to a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>revocable trust</i> with a bank as trustee,
since even today you can avoid a lot of these problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the person and of the property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That

public, and most families hate to deal with it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Finally, as an attorney involved in such matters, keep in mind that you
should tell the person under a power of attorney to account annually to the

          >Here we have the foreclosure of the equity of redemption. There is a
          period after default where there can be an acceleration (assume that
          there is). So then you have the equity of redemption. The mortgagor
          still has the right to pay off the mortgage and then own the property
          unencumbered by it. How long does that right exist? That equity of
          redemption exists until it is foreclosed. Typically, the time at which
          it is foreclosed is the foreclosure sale. There is a bit of a delay
          between the foreclosure auction and the foreclosure of the equity of
          redemption because the sale must be confirmed by the court. This is
          pretty much perfunctory, but it does take some time. In </span

        <span
          >There are mainly three types: (1) judicial sale, (2) power of sale,
          and (3) strict foreclosure. In every state that has power of sale
          foreclosure, it is a mere alternative that exists along with judicial
          foreclosure. Both involve sales, but one involves a court proceeding
          at the courthouse (the judicial sale). The process begins with a
          lawsuit and proceeds the same way a regular lawsuit proceeds. Power of
          sale simply allows the trustee to advertise for some period of time,
          and then the property is sold. This typically takes place at the
          property. The third and least significant method of foreclosure is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">strict</i> foreclosure. For our
          purposes, there are only one or two states that still allow this. The
          problem with strict foreclosure is that it denies the mortgagor the
          surplus of the equity that the mortgagor has in the property. Under
          strict foreclosure, you have no sale. Default occurs, a lawsuit is
          commenced, the order is not an order that the property be offered for
          sale, rather, it�s a decree that the mortgagee owns the property. Is
          the cost of a judicial foreclosure worth the effort?</span

          >What�s the purpose of a foreclosure? What are the necessary parties?
          You need to join all the parties needed to get rid of all the
          mortgages. But just who is that? It could be people other than just
          mortgagees. It could be easement holders. It could be people who own
          condominiums where the condos are located on the property being
          foreclosed. Basically, anyone who holds a lien against the property or
          claims to own an interest that would be lost as a result of the
          foreclosure is a necessary party. We�re looking to eliminate all these
          junior interests. There are also
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">proper</i> parties. The senior
          mortgagee is a proper but
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not necessary</i> party. How
          should junior leases be treated if the lessee isn�t joined? What if
          you don�t join? Maybe the lease is at a below-market rate. What
          happens when the senior mortgagee forecloses but fails to join the
          junior mortgagee? Why would this happen on purpose? It�s hard to
          imagine. But it can happen by mistake.</span

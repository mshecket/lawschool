<p><b><span>Title insurance</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Title
insurance is an odd thing. It’s not
insurance in the typical sense. Typically, if you buy, for example, life insurance, the insurance
company knows that it will suffer a loss, but it just doesn’t know when. Title insurance doesn’t work that way. If everything works right, the title
insurance company should <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i> suffer
a loss, that is, there should <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i>
be a valid claim against the insurance policy. But not everything always works the way it should. There can be off record risks such as
fraud. There can also be violations of
zoning laws, covenants and restrictions, and so on. All of these are detectable and should be
detected if title insurance works the way it should.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here’s
how it works: with the typical policy, you fill out Schedule A with the
elements of the fee simple absolute. The
Schedule A in the book at p. 236 is a bit different in two respects: not all of
the risks are for the full policy amount. But it does have a space to fill in your interest in the land, for
example: “fee simple absolute”. Inflation protection is available for title insurance policies. The other thing that makes title insurance
different than most policies is that it’s a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>single-premium
policy</i>. At the time you purchase the
property, you pay a premium that is calculated as a percentage of the amount of
insurance, and then that’s it. It’s a
one-time payment for coverage basically forever. If there’s a mistake in the policy, that is,
if there is some loss that is covered by the policy, then the policy doesn’t
necessarily pay the full amount of the loss. You do the same calculation of damages that you do with warranties of title. Title insurance only insures legal
matters. It doesn’t deal with acreage or
quality of the land.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Who
pays for title insurance? In </span><st1:place><span
 >Central Ohio</span></st1:place><span>, the standard contracts
have the seller pay for title insurance, not the buyer. Even though the seller pays for the title
insurance, the buyer is entitled to pick the title insurance company. That’s a matter of federal law: the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Under
RESPA, the buyer has the right to pick the title insurance company.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
Schedule B, exceptions and exclusions are listed. “Schedule A <span class=SpellE>giveth</span>,
and Schedule B <span class=SpellE>taketh</span> away.” If you look at Schedule B, you’ll see why
there should never really be a claim under a title insurance policy. Exceptions should be everything that a
diligent search of the public records would reveal: liens, leases, easements
and so on. You’re not insured against
losses resulting from any of those things. You have a vested fee simple absolute except for everything that’s in
the public records and is a defect in the title. As a result, if the title insurance company
is careful, then you won’t suffer any loss at all. If an encumbrance is not of record, you don’t
take subject to it, and if it is of record, the title insurance policy doesn’t
cover you. If you don’t read Schedule B,
you don’t really know what insurance you have, if any.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
addition to the exceptions that are specific to that property, there are also
exclusions that are general to all policies issued by the title insurance
company. You can negotiate to have some
of them removed for a price. The most
important exclusion is the exclusion for things that are known by the buyer at
the closing date but not known by the company. You can’t hide defects from the <span class=GramE>company,</span> you
must disclose all defects to the company. The Schedule B exceptions listed on p. 239 are more similar to the way
we would see them drawn up on a policy issued in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Is
a title policy an opinion of title? Isn’t
there an incentive on the part of the title insurance company not to search the
title at all? It depends on how high the
search costs are. You could do this on
an actuarial basis. You could say: “We’ve
been in this business a long time, and we know what the risk is.” You could charge a premium based on the
historical risk rather than doing a search of the title. This may make more sense for the title
insurance company than for the purchaser of the property, since title insurance
won’t cover your full loss. If you sue,
you might be disappointed that the title insurance companies aren’t trying to
determine if the title is marketable. Is
the title company obligated to be reasonable in conducting a search? What difference does it make? You might want to find a basis for tort liability
if your policy doesn’t fully cover your loss.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
happens if you have something that is a matter of record but it’s not listed in
Schedule B? Is the title insurance
company liable? Sure they are! That’s exactly what they’re supposed to
do. What if there is something that’s a
matter of record, isn’t on Schedule B, but also comes within one of the
exclusions? <span class=GramE>For
example, “encroachments or questions of location, boundary and area, which an
accurate survey may disclose”.</span> You
can’t rely on the policy to tell you that this condition doesn’t exist. Say there is an easement that a survey would
reveal. Why would they be liable? The cases say there ought to be coverage: the
exclusions can’t be relied on by the title company to eliminate Schedule
B. Whether or not you have a duty to
search, if you do the search and list something in Schedule B, then if you find
it, you must include it there. The idea
of title insurance is to provide protection from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>on-record</i> risks. If you find
an easement, for example, and then exclude it anyway, you’ve basically eviscerated
the policy.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Most
residential transactions are very low risk transactions, at least as far as
things that lawyers could discover. There are lots of bad things that could potentially happen, but in
practice, the system seems to work very well without lawyers. So Braunstein thinks it doesn’t make much
sense to have lawyers involved in these highly routine, standardized residential
transactions. If you read the title
policy and saw something that you didn’t understand, you might want to get a
lawyer involved. But generally, lawyers
don’t need to be involved and <span class=GramE>lawyer don’t</span> make much
money being involved, partly because you don’t add much value.</span></p>

from that owner based on a warranty in the deed? What’s the problem here? Let’s say B sues A for a breach of covenants
of title. The insurance policy covers
you and continues to cover you not only for losses that occur while you’re the
owner, but also based on your warranties of title when you convey. The title insurance will be issued with <span
class=GramE>A</span> purchases the property, not when A sells the property.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
policy also includes the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>obligation to defend</i>,
which can be the most important obligation of the insurer. The cost of defense can be more than the
potential liability.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Theories of mortgages</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Possession
is the deal. We want to try to understand
the mortgagee’s and mortgagor’s right to possess the mortgaged property. These theories of mortgages are sometimes
difficult because it’s so ingrained in us that the mortgagor is the one who has
the right to possession. Why would you
buy a house if it meant that a bank employee would be living in it instead of
you? But that’s not the way the mortgage
developed. We have different theories
that give different possessory rights to the mortgagee. We know that after foreclosure, the mortgage
is wiped out. Why would the mortgagee
want possession prior to foreclosure? There are a number of reasons: they may want to stop waste or make
repairs, in other words, they want to protect the collateral. If the mortgagor is doing something that the mortgagee
doesn’t like, they may want to intervene. Maybe the property is a rental property and it’s vacant. Similarly, if the mortgagor is taking the
rents and using them for some purpose other than to pay the mortgage, the mortgagee
might want to stop that as well (“intercept” the rents). The ability to collect the rents depends on
the right to possession.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The title theory of mortgage</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is based on the old-fashioned fee simple determinable. There is possession by the mortgagee that
defaults to the mortgagor. This theory
is most prevalent in the states closest geographically to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. The mortgagee, under the title theory, is the
owner. The mortgagee is entitled to possession
as soon as the mortgage is created. You
could have a mortgage where you actually intended for the mortgagee to take possession,
so that even if you’re in a title theory state, there will be an implied right
of possession by the mortgagor, or the mortgage will say that the mortgagor has
the right to possession even though the common law in that state would give the
mortgagee the right to possession.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The lien theory of mortgage</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is the theory in most states, including </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. The mortgagee only acquires the right to have
the property sold to pay the debt. These
states don’t think of the mortgage as a conveyance at all. For the purposes of the Recording Acts,
though, we treat mortgages just like conveyances. Lien states think of mortgages as granting a
right to the mortgagee to have the property sold, either privately or by public
sale, and then to have rights created by the mortgage attached to the
proceeds. You don’t own the property. There’s no possessory right there or any interest
in the property itself. You have an
equitable lien that is capable of being turned into money.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Intermediate states</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>probably</i> a lien theory state, but there are cases that go both
ways. In intermediate states, the mortgage
only creates a lien, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>but</i> there <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>are</i> possessory rights in the mortgagee. The mortgagee has the right to possession
after default occurs. So conceptually,
there are three different theories.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>How
does a mortgagee get possession? In a title
theory state, possession can be gained on demand. In an intermediate state, possession can be
gained on demand <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>after default</i>. In a lien theory state, you can only get possession
by a voluntary act of the mortgagor, or when the mortgagor abandons the property,
or when possession is authorized by the mortgage itself.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>These
theories of the mortgage don’t make much difference these days because we use
the same sorts of instruments all throughout the country, and they have the
same provisions. These theories may be
important in other contexts, for example, in determining whether a mortgage
severs a joint tenancy. But mostly, we’ll
be thinking about what the mortgage instrument provides rather than what these
theories would dictate.</span></p>

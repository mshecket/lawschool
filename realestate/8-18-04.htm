<p><b><span>Introduction</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Here
we have a big class in a tiny little classroom.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
here you have your Real Estate Finance, Transfer, and Development course. What about real estate transactions? Have we done that before? We’ll spend more time on transactions in this
class because he didn’t cover it in his property class.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We’ll
do Chapter 1, which he usually skips. We’re
doing §§ (A), (B), (C), (F) and (G). We’ll
have a syllabus tomorrow or the next day.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We’ll
spend a fair amount of time in this class on cases involving residential real
estate. We’ll do this not because it’s the
main focus of this course: lawyers aren’t even involved in it much
anymore. But we’ll emphasize it because
the rules are about the same as commercial real estate. There are now some consumer protection rules
in residential real estate. The rules
don’t apply as harshly with commercial real estate. The law assumes in that case that the parties
have roughly equal bargaining power and can take care of themselves. Residential real estate transactions are easy
to understand, so it’s easier to teach and learn the rules in that context
rather than deal with a commercial transaction where we have to spend a lot of
time on the facts.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>We
have a field trip in this course! It’s
fun! NPR said the other day that it is
expected that there will be one foreclosure for every 117 mortgages outstanding
in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Braunstein
finds that difficult to believe! That
would mean that over time, everyone will get kicked out of their homes! So that’s a big number. Some of the devices that the federal
government uses to make housing more affordable have actually had the opposite
effect. Take ARMs for example: as interest
rates start to go up and adjustable rates rise, people can’t make the payments
and go into foreclosure. We’re going to
go to a foreclosure auction. It will be
on a Friday at </span><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="10"><span style='font-size:
 14.0pt;'>10 AM</span></st1:time><span>. Blow off your other class! It helps you understand the process. When we do foreclosure, we’ll learn the
rules, but also ask whether the rules make sense. They’re designed to protect the borrower, but
are the rules effective? We’ll do this
around Thanksgiving.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
law of real property and the law of real estate finance, which is a subset,
used to be almost <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entirely</i> local,
meaning peculiar to the state where the property is located and in many cases,
peculiar to certain parts of the state. There used to be different practices in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Cleveland</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> than in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Columbus</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> or </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Cincinnati</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. But an </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> lawyer certainly would not
think of representing someone buying real estate in another state. Even today, you’ll generally hire local
counsel to assist you. But the practice
of this area of law has really become much more <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>national</i> in the last 30-40 years for a number of reasons.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Why
was it the way it was? Lawyers are
typically licensed locally. You’re
admitted to practice in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> or maybe two states. As far as lawyers are involved, it must be a
local practice. The same thing was
traditionally true for banks and savings &amp; loans. They were licensed locally and they only
loaned in the area in which they did business. There were local lenders under local law, and that worked to insulate
the law of one state from another. But
things have changed!</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
lawyer, especially in a residential transaction, has become less and less
important, at least when it comes to the buyer and seller. The lender and title insurance company are
represented by counsel, but not the buyer and seller. So the locality makes less of a
difference. Also, banks now operate
nationally. Depression-era bank
restrictions and regulations have been relaxed, and you see more and more <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>national</i> lenders. National lenders want <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>standardization</i>. Every
lender wants to standardize the process as much as possible to reduce
transactions costs. When you don’t need
separate processes and forms for different states, it doesn’t cost as much.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Another
change is the rise of title insurance. After
World War II, there was a big population increase and federal policies designed
to encourage people to buy single-family homes. There was a lot of development, especially out West, that was not near
established financial institutions. The
major </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Chicago</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> banks couldn’t loan money
to build houses in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>. Insurance companies stepped up to the
plate! They’re national lenders. They have lots of money to invest and could
invest nationally. The insurance
companies thought: how do we know title opinions are any good? What if an attorney makes a mistake? Will the attorney be able to pay the damages
suffered due to a bad title opinion? Lending
insurance companies like Prudential and Equitable decided not to rely on local
lawyers, but instead buy insurance themselves. Once you take a lawyer out of giving an opinion on title, they have less
of a role in transactions.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
Federal Housing Authority, Fannie Mae, Farmer’s Home Loan Board and so on are federally-chartered
organizations. They act as a private corporation
but are infused with public interest and public policy. Their debts are backed by the federal government. The FHA wants to help finance this real
estate development that’s going on, particularly residential real estate
development after the war. They make a
deal where they agree to buy mortgages. If you borrow some money in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> and that bank runs out of
money to lend, then that’s okay, but the next person who wants to buy a house
won’t be able to. So the FHA buys the
mortgages. Whoever the home purchaser
was will owe the FHA the money, and the FHA will give the money back to the
bank. The FHA has a big demand, just
like the insurance companies, for uniformity. When the FHA is buying mortgages, they want every single one to be the
same so they don’t have to read each one. They want to know if it’s a certain type of FHA-approved mortgage, and
then they’ll know that it’s acceptable. Banks insist on these because even if they don’t decide to sell the
mortgage to the FHA or Fannie Mae, they might, and they insist that virtually
all mortgages be on the FHA form. So
even though the FHA doesn’t have the authority to prescribe what a mortgage
says, in practice, they have a lot of power.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>All
of these forces are working to make the law of real property, at least in the
context in which we’re studying it, more and more homogeneous throughout the
country. Take for example the Restatement
of Mortgages. Now we can study cases
from all different jurisdictions to determine what the law is. We won’t just look at </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> cases, whereas 20 or 30
years ago that’s almost all we looked at. We will also spend time on the most important forms, as found in the
back of the book. We’ll ask how various
cases would have been decided under an FHA mortgage, for example.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Most
of the lecture will be PowerPoint and the slides will be posted on TWEN. So good. E-mail him regular-like, not on TWEN. He’s Braunstein.1. In the subject
line, no matter what you’re really asking, write “REF”. There will be a filter.</span></p>

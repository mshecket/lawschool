          >We talked about what a rent is. It�s a matter of classification. But
          then things get more confusing. Focus on these three issues: (1) when
          does the assignment become effective between the mortgagor and
          mortgagee? (2) When does the assignment become effective (or
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">perfected</i>) as between the
          mortgagee and third parties? This is the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">priority</i> issue. (3) What
          must be done to foreclose on the assignment of rents? In other words,
          when does the mortgagee get to actually start collecting the
          rents?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are three types of assignments of rents: (1)
          <span class="GramE">The</span> lender collects all rents from the
          beginning of the loan: this is called
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">absolute assignment of rents</i
          >. This is relatively rare. Many clauses that purport to create this
          provide that the mortgagor can maintain possession until something
          happens. The lender usually doesn�t care to get into the business of
          managing the property and collecting rents. You could have just a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">sale</i> of the rents, or the
          right to collect the rents in a security transaction. (2) The
          assignment of rents becomes absolute after default. This occurs much
          more frequently. The language gets confusing: some documents say this
          is an absolute assignment of rents, except for the fact that the
          mortgagee appoints the mortgagor as an agent who is authorized to
          receive rents on the mortgagee�s behalf. The mortgagee actually gets
          the money, though, until default occurs. (3) The mortgagor gets to
          keep the rents and the mortgagee doesn�t get actual possession of them
          until something happens. This is usually a combination of default and
          some other action by the mortgagee.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The purchaser at foreclosure will get the rents because the purchaser
          becomes the owner of the property. The mortgage on the rents is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">gone</i>, just as the mortgage
          on the property is gone. But who will get the rents in the interim
          between default and foreclosure? That�s the issue here.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The actions that can trigger an assignment include taking possession
          (but that often terminates the leases if the leases are junior to the
          mortgage), bringing an action at law to �impound� or �sequester� the
          rents, getting a receiver appointed, making a written demand on the
          tenants to give the mortgagee the right to possession of the rents, or
          making a written demand on the mortgagor. What if you make a demand on
          the mortgagor, but the tenants continue to pay the mortgagor? What is
          the liability of the tenants? We have a contract between landlord and
          tenant. The landlord is also the mortgagor. Then you have an
          assignment of that contract right to a third party, who is the
          mortgagee. The assignment becomes effective as against the obligor,
          the tenant, when the tenant receives actual notice of the assignment.
          Even though the assignment is effective just by giving notice to the
          mortgagor, you�ll still have to do something to actually
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">get</i> the rents. You must
          give the tenants actual notice; they are protected until that
          happens.</span

        <span
          >There are a whole gaggle of <span class="SpellE">Millettes</span> and
          a Fridge. They mortgage some property with assignment of rents to a
          lender called Eastover. Eastover assigns the mortgage to another
          company and appoint Security National to service the loan. What kind
          of assignment of rents clause was in the deed of trust? The court
          reads it as automatic on default. O�Neal Steel gets a judgment lien
          against the <span class="SpellE">Millettes</span> and brings an action
          to garnish rents. Security National claims that they have priority
          with respect to the rents. When are the rights to the rents effective?
          It doesn�t become operative until the mortgagee triggers it somehow.
          Whenever the rights become operative or effective as between the
          parties (when you
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">could</i> demand the rents),
          what acts are required to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">perfect</i> it with respect to
          third parties (namely, O�Neal)? Security National is not entitled to
          possession of the property in a lien state. But during the
          pre-foreclosure period, they
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">are</i> entitled to possession
          of the rents.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The court adopts the Restatement rule, which provides that the
          mortgage on rents is effective against the mortgagor
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and</i> third parties upon
          execution and delivery. What else is required to make it effective
          against third parties? It must be recorded. The Restatement also
          answers the second question: when does the mortgagee�s right to
          actually get the rents accrue? First, whatever conditions
          <span class="GramE">that are</span> in the mortgagee must be
          satisfied: this mortgage says that the right accrues on default. In
          addition, notice must be given to the mortgagor and any subordinate
          mortgagees. What does that mean in this case? O�Neal already has some
          of the rents. Does Security National get them back? Security National
          wins this case. The court finds that they have a higher priority than
          O�Neal. But their right to possession to the rents isn�t going to
          arise <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">until</i> they get O�Neal
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">notice</i> that their mortgage
          is in default and that they are demanding the rents. It looks like
          O�Neal will win as to the rents it received from garnishment before it
          received notice. Notice that O�Neal is not a mortgagee, but will be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">treated</i> as a
          mortgagee.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >How is a mortgage on rents �perfected� as against third parties?
          Rents are real property, so you must record. But some courts and some
          parties think that rents are �just money�, meaning that you must file
          a Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 financing statement. This is
          something you file with the Secretary of State to give everyone else
          notice that you have a lien on someone else�s money. The best practice
          is to file both places�a �belt and suspenders� approach.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the best way to �trigger� or �actuate� an assignment of rents?
          Possession is a sticky business. The best thing is receivership! Why?
          A receivership is easy to get. You don�t terminate junior leases. You
          don�t have to have a strict fiduciary accounting duty. You don�t have
          tort liability. You can make repairs, but don�t
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">have to</i>. Finally, you can
          evict delinquent tenants and fill vacancies.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In this case, there are two mortgages. Someone is embezzling Dart�s
          money! Western Savings and Inland Mortgage are both granted mortgages,
          and both mortgages provide that a receiver shall be appointed. Both
          mortgagees want a receiver appointed, but we�re not sure why. They
          don�t get receivers. Why not? They have security in the rents and
          there is no waste of the property. There was also a federal tax lien
          of almost $200,000. But the tax lien was junior of the other
          mortgages, so the purchaser at foreclosure will take free of the tax
          lien. So when the court evaluates the collateral as to the two
          mortgagees, they�re fine. It�s not the mortgagees� problem whether
          Dart�s debts get paid off.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In order to get a receiver appointed in most jurisdictions, there
          must be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">inadequate security</i>. Some
          courts say that the mortgagor must be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">insolvent</i>. The idea is that
          it doesn�t matter if the property isn�t enough to secure the debt if
          the mortgagor has lots of other assets that could secure the debt.
          This makes some sense, but it arguably deprives the mortgagee of just
          what they bargained for: being able to rely on the property itself and
          not the solvency of the mortgagor. In addition, you usually must show
          that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">waste</i> is threatened.
          You have to show that you�re being threatened and that you don�t have
          a remedy.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What is inadequate security? When is security inadequate? Why was it
          adequate here? What does the mortgagee bargain for? The mortgagee
          bargains for two different kinds of �cushions�. First, the mortgagee
          typically won�t loan 100% of the value of the property, but something
          less, like 80%, which leaves a 20% cushion. The mortgagee also
          bargains for the debt getting paid, meaning that the principal is
          reduced and the cushion gets bigger over time. So you could argue that
          if the value of the security is less than the lien, then security is
          adequate. The other way to argue it is to say that if the ratio of the
          amount of the outstanding lien to the value of the property is greater
          than originally expected, then the security is inadequate. The
          mortgagee typically expects that the principal will be paid down and
          the loan, in some sense, will become more secure as time goes on. The
          Restatement takes the view that you bargained for the cushion: not
          just the original 20%, but the rest of the cushion built into the
          amortization of the mortgage. If the mortgagee isn�t where they
          expected to be on the amortization curve, then we say that the
          security is inadequate.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">special</i> receiver appointed
          to get the rents than to have a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">general </i>receiver take
          possession of the property. To get the rents, you must have a default,
          which would satisfy � 4.2(1), and a demand, as in � 4.2(2). In
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Dart</i>, they�re not trying to
          get possession of the rents, but rather of the property itself. Not
          only do you have to show what you must show to get the rents, but you
          also have to show inadequate security, waste, and possibly the
          insolvency of the mortgagor. An �assignment of rents� or receivership
          clause in the mortgage is not binding on the court. Such a clause,
          however, is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">helpful </i>in
          getting a receiver appointed.</span

        <span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">disaffirm leases</i>. The
          problem is that <span class="GramE">a mortgagor who know</span> that a
          default is threatened may do commercially unreasonable things, like
          rent the property out at a very low rate just to get some cash. Does
          the receiver have the right to disaffirm the leases? The Restatement
          says that the receiver has this power if three conditions are
          satisfied: the lease must have been made when the mortgagor was in
          default, it wasn�t commercially reasonable when made, and it was not
          <span class="GramE">consented</span> to by the mortgagee.</span

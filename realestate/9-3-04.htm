          >Wraparound mortgages were very popular back in the day! The seller
          got a great return on their investment, and the buyer got a good deal
          too. Only the bank got screwed.
          <span class="SpellE">Amfac</span> didn�t like the deal! If they could
          get the money back, they could <span class="SpellE">relend</span> it
          at current rates. They could lend it to the
          <span class="SpellE">Schraders</span> or someone else entirely. They
          would like to get rid of old, low interest rate loans. They exercise
          their �due on sale� clause, which is included in virtually every
          mortgage contract prepared by a commercial lender. These clauses may
          not be present in mortgages made by individuals, or you may be able to
          bargain around them. The �due on sale� clause is required to make a
          loan saleable to FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The court said that the buyers could either pay all cash or could
          assume the existing loan on terms acceptable to
          <span class="SpellE">Amfac</span> and then pay the sellers the
          $12,700. This is all the same to the lenders. The court says that the
          buyers could assume the mortgage, pay $7,000 cash, and give the seller
          a second mortgage for $5,700 due in two years. The court of appeals
          doesn�t like this! They say that the trial court abused their
          discretion in offering this option to the
          <span class="SpellE">Schraders</span>. The problem here was that the
          parties bargained without considering the �due on sale� clause. The
          only way to negotiate an arrangement like this is to bring the lender
          in to the negotiations.</span

        <span
          >With a wraparound mortgage, the buyer gives the seller a note and
          mortgage for the entire amount of the indebtedness. The buyer makes
          payments on that loan at whatever rate they agreed upon. The seller
          would take a portion of those payments and pay them to the original
          lender. The seller is in a position to assure that the payments are
          made on time. But if you do a second mortgage and the buyer doesn�t
          pay, the seller has no way of knowing until he gets a notice that the
          mortgage is in default.</span

        <b><span>Historical development of the mortgage</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The original mortgage started as a fee simple subject to a condition
          subsequent. The mortgagor has a right of entry and the mortgagee has a
          fee simple that can be defeated by the mortgagor paying off on time.
          That means that if the mortgagor is late,
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">at all</i>, and time is of the
          essence, then the condition can never occur. The mortgagee becomes the
          owner of a fee simple absolute and the mortgagor has
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">nothing</i>. There is a great
          potential for an inequitable result here! If the mortgage is small
          with respect to the value of the real estate, the mortgagee gets a
          windfall. If the debt has been paid down, the mortgagee also gets a
          windfall. The mortgagor gets screwed!</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <b><span>Equity of redemption</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The courts of equity come in and develop the concept of the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">equity of redemption</i> (more
          specifically, the equity of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">tardy</i> redemption). The
          mortgagor can come in late and pay the mortgage, even though the law
          courts wouldn�t have allowed it. The courts of equity say: �You�re
          late, but so what?� You originally had to provide a good reason, but
          later you didn�t really need to. But that creates another set of
          problems. The mortgagees say that if you�re late but have the right to
          pay off the mortgage, how late can you be? How do you terminate the
          equity? The doctrine that the courts come up with is a process for
          foreclosing the equity of redemption.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>Everybody talks about
          foreclosing the mortgage, but it�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >not really the mortgage that�s being foreclosed</i
          >. What�s being foreclosed is the further exercise of the equity of
          redemption, that is, your
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">right</i> to pay off the
          mortgage. The result is that the court sets an �outside date�, which
          is essentially the date of sale. The court orders that the sheriff
          seize and sell the property at public auction. That is the date beyond
          which the mortgagor cannot exercise the equity of redemption. The
          courts in </span

          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >, by custom, don�t approve auction sales of real property until three
          days after the auction.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >When we looked at the mortgage as a fee simple subject to a condition
          subsequent, it was very much like
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">strict foreclosure</i>, meaning
          that the mortgagee is not required to sell the property. The
          mortgagee, upon declaring a default and foreclosing the equity of
          redemption, simply becomes the owner of the property. But the problem
          with that is that the mortgagee may get a windfall because whatever
          equity the mortgagor has in the property is lost and held in its
          entirety by the mortgagee.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span>Almost every state in the </span

          ><st1:place><span>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region
        ><span

          ></st1:State
        ><span
          >). Instead, foreclosure by sale is required, the benefit of which is
          two-fold: (1) you generate cash under circumstances controlled by the
          law so that there is some assurance of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">reasonableness</i> of the
          manner in which the sale is conducted. (2) The cash is distributed to
          the parties
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">to whom it�s due</i>. The
          mortgagee only gets the amount of the debt outstanding, and if there
          is any surplus it will go to junior mortgagees, and then to the
          mortgagor in the value of the mortgagor�s equity. But how often is
          there any surplus? There is no surplus in a majority of cases. If the
          proceeds from the sale of the property don�t satisfy the debt in full,
          the debtor will be personally liable for the balance.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is a so-called rule against �clogging�. Mortgagees would
          sometimes demand that mortgagors waive the equity of redemption. This
          was found to be against public policy and would not be upheld. The
          assumption is that the mortgagor and mortgagee have unequal bargaining
          power and that the law will be entirely circumvented if we allow these
          waivers to take place. The circumstances under which the courts find
          an attempted waiver can be surprising. Courts look very closely at
          mortgage deals to look for anything that looks like a waiver of the
          equity of redemption.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Before default and acceleration, you have the legal right of
          redemption: you may have the right to pre-pay, you may have to wait
          until a specified date, but the law lets you eventually take the
          property free of the encumbrance and hold it in fee simple absolute.
          After default but before foreclosure, there is the equitable right of
          redemption, which is what we�ve just been talking about. After
          foreclosure, you have a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">statutory</i>
          right of redemption in some states (mainly Midwestern farm states not
          including </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span
          >). This developed during the Depression with the idea that people
          were losing their property, and if people could just wait a little
          while, values would bounce back up (but this was overoptimistic � it
          took until the 1950�s for the prices to reach pre-Depression level).
          The idea was that the person foreclosed upon had time to raise the
          money to get the property back from the purchaser at the
          auction.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Any time you create a right in the mortgagor, you create a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">risk</i> in the mortgagee. The
          mortgagee will try to protect itself from that risk by raising
          interest rates or changing some other term of the mortgage. There�s no
          free lunch here! The person who buys the property at the foreclosure
          sale in a state with statutory redemption will probably get it at a
          discount because they�re taking subject to statutory restrictions.
          That increases the personal liability for the person who suffers the
          foreclosure. The farm lobby is powerful! The farm states all get two
          senators.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">whole</i> amount of
          indebtedness becomes due. You must have an acceleration clause in the
          note for this to be allowed. It would be very risky to foreclosure
          prior to acceleration: you would only get the payments in default, not
          the entire balance.</span

        <b><span>Mortgage foreclosures</span></b>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >A mortgage is a right to get paid out of the proceeds of that sale in
          preference and priority over everybody with a subordinate right. That
          means that if you have a mortgage on certain real property, you get
          paid before the unsecured creditors of the mortgagor. You get paid
          before the other people that may own an interest in the property that
          is junior in time to yours. The property gets sold at foreclosure.
          What is the state of title of the purchaser? The purchaser at
          foreclosure gets the title as it existed
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">immediately before</i> the
          original mortgage was entered into.
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">That�s important!</i> This is
          part of the definition of a mortgage. In the overwhelming majority of
          cases, the original mortgage ceases to exist; the purchaser at
          foreclosure takes free of the first mortgage. When we get to the
          problem of omitted junior lien holders, we�ll find that the mortgage
          will be considered to still be in existence for certain purposes. What
          if a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">second mortgagee </i
          >forecloses? Who owns what? The purchaser at foreclosure gets the
          title as it was just before the mortgage was entered into, namely,
          they take the property
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Junior mortgages are more risky because you get paid second. What�s a
          less obvious reason? The second mortgagee can�t control the timing of
          the foreclosure, and that may be important. If you�re in a situation
          where your judgment as the lender is that if you wait you can sell the
          property for more money later than now, and if you�re in control of
          the foreclosure process, then you can decide to wait. But if you�re
          the second mortgagee, you can�t control the timing. The first
          mortgagee is in control. If you have a sale by the first mortgagee,
          the purchaser will pay no more than fair market value. But if you have
          a sale by the second mortgagee, you buy for fair market value minus
          the value of the first mortgage. When the second mortgage forecloses,
          the first mortgagee receives none of the proceeds of the sale, but the
          mortgage is still in effect. The first mortgagee can foreclose
          later.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> to get around the
          equitable right of redemption. It�s designed so that the lender can
          purchase
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >at the lender�s own foreclosure sale</i
          >. In some states, mortgagees couldn�t bid at their own sale, meaning
          that they couldn�t control the property anymore. So this device was
          created to allow the person who would be the mortgagee to purchase at
          the lender�s own foreclosure sale. This also gives the lender the
          option whether to go through judicial foreclosure or to exercise the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">power of sale</i>, which
          happens by statute and without much intervention by the courts. Three
          people are involved: the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">grantor</i> is the same as the
          mortgagor. The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">trustee </i>is
          the new person in this transaction, but the trustee�s sole job is to
          get the deed to the property and then to
          <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> it to the grantor when the deed
          of trust is paid off. The �trust form� is borrowed for the purposes of
          getting around restrictions in certain dates.</span

          the property. The bank asks the mortgagor to promise not to convey the
          property to anyone else or use it for collateral in any other
          transaction. It�s not a very powerful device, but it at least keeps
          some property there that will be available to satisfy the bank�s
          personal judgment. The second thing you can do is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">just lie</i>. Instead of a
          mortgage, the borrower conveys the property to the lender without
          reference to a loan, but with a secret agreement that it
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">is</i> a mortgage. This doesn�t
          work either, but the idea is that in the event of a default, you don�t
          have to go through foreclosure or sale or anything else. These kinds
          of deeds are actually quite easy to set aside if you can prove this
          arrangement. Finally, you have the installment or land sale contract.
          This looks like a purchase agreement, but in substance it�s a
          mortgage. Law treats the last two as mortgages. The first one is not
          treated by a mortgage. You have a cause of action for breach of
          contract, but you don�t have the priority that a mortgage would have
          given.</span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Wraparound
mortgages were very popular back in the day!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The seller got a great return on their investment, and the buyer got a
good deal too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Only the bank got
screwed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Amfac</span>
didn’t like the deal!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they could get
the money back, they could <span class=SpellE>relend</span> it at current
rates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They could lend it to the <span
class=SpellE>Schraders</span> or someone else entirely.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They would like to get rid of old, low interest
rate loans.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They exercise their “due on
sale” clause, which is included in virtually every mortgage contract prepared
by a commercial lender.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These clauses
may not be present in mortgages made by individuals, or you may be able to
bargain around them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The “due on sale”
clause is required to make a loan saleable to FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
court said that the buyers could either pay all cash or could assume the
existing loan on terms acceptable to <span class=SpellE>Amfac</span> and then
pay the sellers the $12,700.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is all
the same to the lenders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court says
that the buyers could assume the mortgage, pay $7,000 cash, and give the seller
a second mortgage for $5,700 due in two years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The court of appeals doesn’t like this!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They say that the trial court abused their discretion in offering this option
to the <span class=SpellE>Schraders</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The problem here was that the parties bargained without considering the “due
on sale” clause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only way to
negotiate an arrangement like this is to bring the lender in to the
negotiations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>With
a wraparound mortgage, the buyer gives the seller a note and mortgage for the
entire amount of the indebtedness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
buyer makes payments on that loan at whatever rate they agreed upon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller would take a portion of those
payments and pay them to the original lender.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The seller is in a position to assure that the payments are made on
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if you do a second mortgage
and the buyer doesn’t pay, the seller has no way of knowing until he gets a
notice that the mortgage is in default.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the mortgage<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
original mortgage started as a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagor has a right of entry and the mortgagee
has a fee simple that can be defeated by the mortgagor paying off on time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means that if the mortgagor is late, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at all</i>, and time is of the essence, then
the condition can never occur.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagee
becomes the owner of a fee simple absolute and the mortgagor has <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nothing</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There is a great potential for an inequitable result here!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the mortgage is small with respect to the value
of the real estate, the mortgagee gets a windfall.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the debt has been paid down, the mortgagee
also gets a windfall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagor gets
screwed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Equity of redemption<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
courts of equity come in and develop the concept of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>equity of redemption</i> (more specifically, the equity of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tardy</i> redemption).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagor can come in late and pay the mortgage,
even though the law courts wouldn’t have allowed it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The courts of equity say: “You’re late, but
so what?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You originally had to provide
a good reason, but later you didn’t really need to.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But that creates another set of
problems.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagees say that if you’re
late but have the right to pay off the mortgage, how late can you be?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do you terminate the equity?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The doctrine that the courts come up with is
a process for foreclosing the equity of redemption. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Everybody talks about foreclosing the mortgage,
but it’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not really the mortgage that’s
being foreclosed</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s being
foreclosed is the further exercise of the equity of redemption, that is, your <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>right</i> to pay off the mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The result is that the court sets an “outside
date”, which is essentially the date of sale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The court orders that the sheriff seize and sell the property at public
auction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is the date beyond which
the mortgagor cannot exercise the equity of redemption.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The courts in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>, by custom, don’t approve
auction sales of real property until three days after the auction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>When
we looked at the mortgage as a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, it
was very much like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strict foreclosure</i>,
meaning that the mortgagee is not required to sell the property.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagee, upon declaring a default and
foreclosing the equity of redemption, simply becomes the owner of the property.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the problem with that is that the mortgagee
may get a windfall because whatever equity the mortgagor has in the property is
lost and held in its entirety by the mortgagee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Almost
every state in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>, in almost every
circumstance, prohibits strict foreclosure (except <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>maybe</i> </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Vermont</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead, foreclosure by sale is required, the
benefit of which is two-fold: (1) you generate cash under circumstances
controlled by the law so that there is some assurance of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>reasonableness</i> of the manner in which the sale is conducted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) The cash is distributed to the parties <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>to whom it’s due</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagee only gets the amount of the
debt outstanding, and if there is any surplus it will go to junior mortgagees,
and then to the mortgagor in the value of the mortgagor’s equity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But how often is there any surplus?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no surplus in a majority of cases.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the proceeds from the sale of the property
don’t satisfy the debt in full, the debtor will be personally liable for the
balance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>There
is a so-called rule against “clogging”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mortgagees
would sometimes demand that mortgagors waive the equity of redemption.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was found to be against public policy
and would not be upheld.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The assumption
is that the mortgagor and mortgagee have unequal bargaining power and that the law
will be entirely circumvented if we allow these waivers to take place.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The circumstances under which the courts find
an attempted waiver can be surprising.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Courts
look very closely at mortgage deals to look for anything that looks like a
waiver of the equity of redemption.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Before
default and acceleration, you have the legal right of redemption: you may have
the right to pre-pay, you may have to wait until a specified date, but the law
lets you eventually take the property free of the encumbrance and hold it in fee
simple absolute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After default but
before foreclosure, there is the equitable right of redemption, which is what
we’ve just been talking about.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After
foreclosure, you have a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>statutory</i>
right of redemption in some states (mainly Midwestern farm states not including
</span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
  12.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
'>).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
developed during the Depression with the idea that people were losing their property,
and if people could just wait a little while, values would bounce back up (but
this was overoptimistic – it took until the 1950’s for the prices to reach
pre-Depression level).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The idea was that
the person foreclosed upon had time to raise the money to get the property back
from the purchaser at the auction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Any
time you create a right in the mortgagor, you create a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>risk</i> in the mortgagee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagee
will try to protect itself from that risk by raising interest rates or changing
some other term of the mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s
no free lunch here!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The person who buys
the property at the foreclosure sale in a state with statutory redemption will
probably get it at a discount because they’re taking subject to statutory
restrictions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That increases the
personal liability for the person who suffers the foreclosure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The farm lobby is powerful!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The farm states all get two senators.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>An
acceleration clause says that in the event of a default, the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>whole</i> amount of indebtedness becomes
due.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You must have an acceleration
clause in the note for this to be allowed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It would be very risky to foreclosure prior to acceleration: you would
only get the payments in default, not the entire balance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>A mortgage
is a right to get paid out of the proceeds of that sale in preference and
priority over everybody with a subordinate right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means that if you have a mortgage on
certain real property, you get paid before the unsecured creditors of the mortgagor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You get paid before the other people that may
own an interest in the property that is junior in time to yours.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The property gets sold at foreclosure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is the state of title of the
purchaser?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The purchaser at foreclosure
gets the title as it existed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>immediately
before</i> the original mortgage was entered into.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>That’s
important!</i><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is part of the definition
of a mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the overwhelming
majority of cases, the original mortgage ceases to exist; the purchaser at
foreclosure takes free of the first mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When we get to the problem of omitted junior lien holders, we’ll find
that the mortgage will be considered to still be in existence for certain
purposes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>second mortgagee </i>forecloses?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Who owns what?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The purchaser at
foreclosure gets the title as it was just before the mortgage was entered into,
namely, they take the property <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>encumbered
by the first mortgage</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>[See hypo in

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Junior
mortgages are more risky because you get paid second.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s a less obvious reason?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The second mortgagee can’t control the timing
of the foreclosure, and that may be important.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you’re in a situation where your judgment as the lender is that if
you wait you can sell the property for more money later than now, and if you’re
in control of the foreclosure process, then you can decide to wait.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if you’re the second mortgagee, you can’t
control the timing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first mortgagee
is in control.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have a sale by the
first mortgagee, the purchaser will pay no more than fair market value.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if you have a sale by the second mortgagee,
you buy for fair market value minus the value of the first mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the second mortgage forecloses, the
first mortgagee receives none of the proceeds of the sale, but the mortgage is
still in effect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first mortgagee can
foreclose later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The reason for this device is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> to get around the equitable right of
redemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s designed so that the
lender can purchase <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at the lender’s own
foreclosure sale</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In some states, mortgagees
couldn’t bid at their own sale, meaning that they couldn’t control the property
anymore.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So this device was created to
allow the person who would be the mortgagee to purchase at the lender’s own
foreclosure sale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This also gives the
lender the option whether to go through judicial foreclosure or to exercise the
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>power of sale</i>, which happens by statute
and without much intervention by the courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Three people are involved: the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>grantor</i>
is the same as the mortgagor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>trustee </i>is the new person in this
transaction, but the trustee’s sole job is to get the deed to the property and
then to <span class=SpellE>reconvey</span> it to the grantor when the deed of
trust is paid off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The “trust form” is
borrowed for the purposes of getting around restrictions in certain dates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>These
are designed to avoid the equity of redemption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>covenant not to <span
class=SpellE>coney</span> or <span class=GramE>encumber</span></i> the property.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bank asks the mortgagor to promise not to
convey the property to anyone else or use it for collateral in any other
transaction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not a very powerful
device, but it at least keeps some property there that will be available to
satisfy the bank’s personal judgment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The second thing you can do is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>just
lie</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead of a mortgage, the
borrower conveys the property to the lender without reference to a loan, but
with a secret agreement that it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> a mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This doesn’t work either, but the idea is
that in the event of a default, you don’t have to go through foreclosure or
sale or anything else.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These kinds of
deeds are actually quite easy to set aside if you can prove this
arrangement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally, you have the
installment or land sale contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
looks like a purchase agreement, but in substance it’s a mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Law treats the last two as mortgages.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first one is not treated by a mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have a cause of action for breach of
contract, but you don’t have the priority that a mortgage would have given.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

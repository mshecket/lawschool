        <span
          >Last time we talked about an alternative to holder in due course
          protection: get an estoppel certificate in favor of the assignee. This
          is the only alternative with a non-negotiable note. The holder in due
          course doctrine only protects against personal defenses and not
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">real </i>defenses. An estoppel
          statement is not effective if obtained by fraud, or against �latent�
          equities, that is, an equity in favor of someone
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">other than</i> the mortgagor.
          There are limits on the holder in due course doctrine.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >There was the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Peters</i> case
          where there was a note and mortgage granted by Peters to </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Norwood</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span
          >, and then an assignment of the note and mortgage to Groover, who is
          also a holder in due course. Peters pays </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Norwood</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span
          >. Groover says that he should be paid! Does Peters have to pay
          Groover? Yes! Normally, if I have a contract with someone, the
          contract is seen as
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">evidence</i> of the obligation,
          not the obligation itself. The obligation is the mutual promises the
          parties have made. That�s the actual contract. But a negotiable note
          is a �symbolic� writing: any payment to a person who doesn�t possess
          the writing is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">null</i>.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The UCC Article 3 says that transfer of an instrument happens when it
          is delivered with intent (for a purpose). Transfer vests in the
          transferee the right to enforce the instrument. The �symbolic writing�
          doctrine won�t be a problem when the original mortgagee has a
          �servicing contract�, is otherwise an agent, or when the assignee is
          estopped to deny the payment. So there are some protections from this
          problem. The best protection is to make sure the payee is
          solvent.</span

          Marketable title means good title, one that a majority of lawyers in a
          particular jurisdiction would advise a purchaser to accept without
          discounting the price due to some defect in the title. You don�t need

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This is a very odd doctrine, and it�s the kind of thing that creates
          traps if you�re not aware of the doctrine. Most people think that the
          risk of loss is on the seller until you complete the purchase: as long
          as you�re in the contract stage, if something happens to the property
          you get out of the contract. But the doctrine of equitable conversion
          is to the contrary. It�s an old, stupid law. There are lots of
          proposals to change it. We have the idea that as soon as the contract
          is signed, equitable title is in the purchaser. The purchaser is
          considered to be the owner. The vendor still has legal title to the
          property, but not equitable title. If the property is damaged, for
          example, then the purchaser (as the owner of the property) suffers the
          loss, just as all owners do. But most people don�t think that way, so
          the doctrine has the potential for causing problems. Around the time
          of hurricanes, you get lots of cases along these lines. What�s we�re
          doing is recharacterizing real and personal property: that�s the
          �conversion�. The vendor starts with real property, and the vendee
          starts with personal property (money). When the contract is signed,
          the vendor is said to have only personal property (the proceeds of the
          sale) and the vendee is said to have real property (in equity): the
          title to the real estate.</span

          >If there�s no clause in the contract allocating casualty loss, then
          who has it? <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>The vendee does,
          because we consider the vendee the owner of the property. This doesn�t
          seem consistent with regular people�s expectations. Pretty much every
          real estate contract written by a lawyer shifts the risk of laws and
          eliminates the conversion rule. If people do this without an attorney,
          they probably won�t even think of discussing this. This isn�t
          consistent with the way people generally insure real property! The
          vendor is the one who is likely to have the insurance, and the vendee
          won�t get the insurance until the contract closes. The vendee might
          fail to take the usual precautions that an ordinary vendee
          would.</span

        <span

          damage. You can�t burn your own house down and then ask for the full
          purchase price. It also doesn�t apply when equitable title has not yet
          passed to the purchaser, for example, if the title is not marketable
          or a condition specified in the contract has not been fulfilled. If
          the vendor is entitled to specific performance, the law treats it like
          it has already occurred. But if the vendor is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> entitled to specific
          performance, then the effects don�t kick in.</span

        <span
          >When we say the purchaser has the risk, we mean that the purchaser
          has no right to rescind and is obligated to complete the purchase at
          the agreed price. In the contract on p. 21, we see that the risk of
          loss is on the seller until closing. That�s more in line with ordinary
          people�s expectations, at least with a marketing contract as opposed
          to an installment sale contract. Then the contract tries to make a
          distinction between major and minor damage, using the figure of 10% of
          the purchase price as a cutoff.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>If the damage is greater than
          10%, the buyer can choose to proceed if the seller agrees to repair or
          to back out of the transaction. If the damage is less than 10%, the
          buyer <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">must</i> proceed unless
          the seller doesn�t promise to fix the damage in writing.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >If the vendor has the risk of loss, the purchaser can rescind. We�ll
          talk about this doctrine more when we get into title, but the other
          possibility is that the purchaser has the right to specific
          performance, but doesn�t want to have to pay full price. The purchaser
          may want specific performance with abatement. They may want the
          transaction to go through, but they don�t want to pay full price. If
          the damage or defect is not substantial, the buyer has the right to
          specific performance with abatement. This usually comes up when the
          vendor agrees to sell 1,000 acres of land when it turns out he only
          has 998 acres. It�s the buyer�s choice of remedy to sue for specific
          performance in the first place, and equally so to sue for specific
          performance with abatement.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >This Act provides that when neither legal title nor possession has
          been transferred, and all or a material part is destroyed or taken in
          eminent domain, then the vendor can�t enforce the contract and the
          purchaser is entitled to recover her earnest money or any price paid.
          So if neither possession nor title has passed, the risk of loss is
          still on the vendor. But what is a �material part�? It means different
          things in different circumstances. There is a case where the building
          was destroyed and the buyer wanted to proceed with the contract
          anyway. It came up under </span
        ><st1:State
          ><st1:place><span>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          law. The seller wanted to get out of the contract. The court said that
          the damage wasn�t material because the buyer wasn�t buying the
          building: the buyer planned to tear the building down as soon as the
          land was purchased. So one of the circumstances is what the intended
          use is by the buyer. Maybe the building that was destroyed wasn�t a
          material part of the consideration.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What happens if the damage is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> material? The risk
          stays on the buyer because there is no provision in the Uniform Act
          that would change it. What�s material to a very wealthy person or not
          material to a very wealthy person may be very material to someone who
          has less money. So for non-material damage, the equitable conversion
          doctrine continues to apply. Can the purchaser get abatement under the
          Uniform Act if damage is not material? The common law applies.
          <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>If the purchaser would be
          entitled to specific performance with abatement under the common law,
          then the purchaser is entitled to it here. Can the purchaser recover
          other expenses and costs? Is the specific performance remedy
          exclusive? We�re talking about material damage. There�s nothing here
          that precludes the vendee from other remedies. But it would be
          unlikely that the vendee would be entitled to damages as well, because
          we�re assuming that the difficulty was not caused by the vendor. The
          doctrine of mutuality of obligation says that if the vendor doesn�t
          have the right to seek other damages, then the vendee shouldn�t be
          able to either.</span

        <span
          >The vendor sells land under an installment sale contract. Then a
          judgment is entered against the vendor. We have a situation where
          legal title is in the vendor. The vendor fails to pay a bill, for
          example, and a judgment is entered against the vendor. Once a judgment
          is entered against you, it becomes a lien against all of the real
          property that�s owned by the judgment debtor in that county. Its
          priority dates from the date the judgment is recorded. The lien holder
          could go to court and ask that the property be sold at public auction
          and have the judgment paid out of the proceeds. Now let�s say that the
          vendee continues to make payments on the contract and sells it to
          another vendee. Is the property, in the hands of vendee #2, subject to
          the judgment lien? Vendee #2 will check the title before purchasing
          the property and he�ll see the lien. But once we say that vendee #1
          has good title, it means he can alienate it. One way of looking at
          this is to say that under the doctrine of equitable conversion the
          real property is in the hands of the vendee, and the judgment lien
          only applies to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">real property</i>. At the time
          of the judgment, there was nothing the vendor owned that the lien
          could attach to.</span

          before the vendor sold. What else? The lien was against the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">purchaser</i>, not the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">vendor</i>. The action is
          brought against the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">purchaser</i> from the vendee.
          Is this a risk of loss case? No, it�s a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">characterization</i> issue. We
          must decide whether the vendee has any interest in real property. If
          the vendee, who was the debtor, has any interest in real property,
          then the judgment lien will attach to that interest, and anyone who
          purchases from the vendee will take the property
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">encumbered</i> by that judgment
          lien. On the one hand, the court could say that bare possession is an
          interest in real property, or the court could say that under the
          doctrine of equitable conversion, the vendee had equitable title and
          so the judgment lien attaches to the equitable title the vendee has
          and follows the property into the hands of any subsequent
          vendee.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Do the two rules seem consistent? If the statute says that a judgment
          attaches to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">any interest</i> in
          real property, then that�s easy. If the statute says that the judgment
          attaches to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">any real property</i> of the
          debtor, then it might be trickier. But Braunstein says that this is
          the former case, and the court made it more complicated than
          necessary. The two results seem consistent: (1) the vendee, not the
          vendor, is considered the owner when the lien is based on a judgment
          against the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">vendor </i>and (2)
          we <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">do</i> consider the vendee
          to be the owner when the lien is against the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">vendee</i>. The doctrine of
          equitable conversion leads to the same result.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >The courts try to find a way around the insurance issue. The
          difficulty is that insurance is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">personal contract</i>. It�s a
          contract between the insurer and the insured. It doesn�t benefit
          anyone else. The insurance company doesn�t want to pay off to the
          vendee, even if the vendee has the risk of loss. That�s pretty
          uniform, good law. Some courts will say: that�s fine, but once the
          insured gets the money, the vendor holds the money in trust for the
          vendee. This is a way of ameliorating the harsh effect of equitable
          conversion. At least to the extent that there was insurance, the
          vendee will be protected to that extent. It might not be the full
          amount of the loss, but at least it helps to some degree.</span

          the vendor hasn�t suffered a loss because under the doctrine of
          equitable conversion the loss falls to the vendee? These issues are
          discussed in the notes. How does insurance come into play in these
          situations? You can get around this by simply contracting around it.
          You agree to keep the risk of loss with the vendor until closing, the

          of his real property to the son and all his personal property to the
          daughter? Who gets what? What does the son get? He gets legal title,
          subject to the purchaser�s claim based on the contract. The son must
          deed the land. The daughter gets the purchase price. That doesn�t seem
          fair! Wouldn�t this have surprised the vendor before his death and
          frustrate his intent after his death? It�s a bad result! What happens
          if it�s the other way around, and the purchaser dies, having left all
          his real property to his son and all his personal property to his
          daughter? The daughter has to pay the purchase price, and the son gets
          the land! Again, that frustrates the testator�s intention. But that�s
          the way the doctrine would work. If the purchaser agreed to pay cash,
          then it doesn�t matter whether the purchaser dies during the executory
          period of the contract or after it�s executed. But it the purchaser
          finances the transaction, the result is different!</span

          You give me $100,000, and I promise to pay it back. But you may not

          you have a mortgage. The mortgage is a lien for the repayment of the

          options the mortgagee has. There are two sets of obligations: the
          promissory note and the mortgage. The purpose of the mortgage is to
          aid in collection, and the way that happens is by foreclosure. But
          there is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">another</i> set of

          promissory note say? It tells you that you must repay, and it says how
          you must do so. You can enter into a loan for 90 days, at which point
          all interest accrued and the principal is paid all at once. That�s
          very unusual for a long-term mortgage, though. It doesn�t make sense!
          You could also have level payments with interest only: pay the
          interest each year, and then pay the principal back at the end of the
          loan. This type of loan is used frequently for a commercial loan where
          the loan won�t be in place for a very long time. But these aren�t used
          very often in residential real estate transactions. These
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">were</i> used before the Great
          Depression, when the idea of interest-only was more popular. Mortgages
          were much shorter in length. But interest-only led to a lot of
          defaults, and a kind of cascading effect. You could have a level
          payment that is some arbitrary amount. You could pay interest plus a
          certain amount of principal each month, followed by a payment of the
          remainder of the principal at the end of the loan. This is used with
          income-producing property. You pay the interest plus a given amount of
          the principal. You negotiate based on what the income of the building
          is.</span

        <span
          >The last and most common way to pay off the loan is the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">fully amortized</i> mortgage,
          meaning that once you establish a term and an interest rate, you do a
          calculation. If you make a payment of a certain amount, then at the
          end of the term, the mortgage will be paid in full: principal
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and</i> interest. It�s a
          constant payment of the same amount every month, and by the time you
          make the last payment, the loan is fully repaid. The last payment will
          be the same amount that the first one was. This is the most common
          mortgage, especially for residential transactions.</span

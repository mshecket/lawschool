      <p>
        <span
          >The typical transaction involves a contract. Even simple real estate
          transactions are more complex generally than transactions involving
          personal property. This is partly the result of tradition and partly
          the nature of the transaction itself that makes it more difficult. The
          typical deal starts, from the buyer�s perspective, with finding a
          property, with or without the aid of a real estate agent or broker. In
          the overwhelming majority of cases, the seller has already contracted
          with a real estate broker. The seller will have entered into a listing
          agreement that authorizes the broker to put up signs, etc. and
          hopefully bring buyers forward.</span

      <p>
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span>An aside: </span></i
        ><span
          >A real estate agent is a lesser qualification than a real estate
          broker. An agent takes an exam and is licensed by the state to engage
          in that practice. You don�t need any experience. But you have to do
          business with a real estate broker, who needs to have been practicing
          for a certain amount of time and have passed a certain more difficult
          exam. So a real estate agent cannot practice on his or her own. In
          terms of what we�re studying, there is no difference between the agent
          and the broker and so we�ll use the terms synonymously for the most
          part. Note how this is different than the meaning of broker that
          you�ll find in
          <a href="http://lawschool.mikeshecket.com/ba">BA</a>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Next, the parties come together and decide that they�ve agreed on the
          property and terms, and thus a contract must be prepared. In
          residential transactions, the contract is almost always printed on a
          standard form that is published jointly by the Bar Association and the
          Board of Realtors. Braunstein says it�s not a bad contract. The idea
          is that there�s not enough money involved in residential transactions
          to draw up a contract from scratch every time. It doesn�t justify
          having a lawyer involved because the transactions are pretty routine.
          The parties can usually customize just a few clauses themselves. In
          commercial transactions, however, form contracts are rarely used, even
          for relatively simple transactions. Big transactions begin to justify
          the attorneys� fees involved and negotiations that bring the two sides
          together in their understanding of their agreement.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why do you need a contract of sale? There are two things going on.
          Banks don�t want to get involved in a transaction until they know what
          the transaction is. They don�t want to process a loan until the
          property and terms are already determined (though this has changed in
          the last 10 years with prequalification). Also, the buyer won�t want
          to commit to purchase until financing is secured. The buyer doesn�t
          want to unconditionally promise hundreds of thousands of dollars that
          the buyer doesn�t have. The seller has an incentive to have a contract
          as well, even if it�s somewhat contingent. The seller is going to
          essentially take the property off the market, and they want to make
          sure that the buyer is obligated to secure financing and do their best
          to close the transaction.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The other thing that distinguishes the transaction in the purchase of
          real as opposed to personal property is the question of title. We
          separate ownership from possession in the law of real property.
          Someone who is in possession of land may not own it or may not own the
          whole �bundle of sticks�. You must investigate title, which takes time
          and costs money. Buyers don�t want to take the time to investigate
          title and then find that the property is off the market. Title
          insurance works by telling the title insurer what property you want.
          They do a title search and then issue a title commitment, saying that
          if you buy the property they will insure title on the property.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Finally, we come to closing. Closing describes two different things:
          it describes, at least in some cases, a kind of conference that takes
          place with the buyer, real estate agent and
          <span class="GramE">title company</span> and frequently a bank
          representative. You meet for the purpose of
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">fully executing </i>the
          transaction. When we say a transaction is to close on a certain date,
          we mean that all of the obligations of the contract are to be
          performed on that date.
          <span class="GramE"
            >The obligations of the contract boil down to the buyer paying the
            money and the seller delivering the deed.</span
          >
          At that point the contract becomes executed and is no longer
          executory. The deed is then transferred.
          <span class="GramE"
            >Then documents have to be recorded, particularly the deed and the
            mortgage.</span
          >
          Lawyers may handle this, but more frequently the title company takes
          care of it. Closing memoranda and �bibles� are prepared. And that�s
          it�unless there�s litigation.</span

      <p>
        <b><span>Role of the lawyer</span></b
        ><span></span>
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Lawyers don�t play much of a role in residential real estate
          transactions anymore because they�ve been driven out by title
          insurance. The most complex thing that the lawyer did was give an
          opinion of title. Now that�s done by title insurance companies. The
          reason for this is that has the real estate market has become more
          national, the demand for uniformity in documentation has become more
          important. Title insurance is on a standard form published by one or
          two different land title organizations. Because they are regulated
          insurance companies, title insurance companies must have a certain
          amount of assets to back their liabilities.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >It is sometimes asserted that title insurance is cheaper than a
          lawyer�s title opinion, but Braunstein thinks that�s not necessarily
          clear. Title insurance starts at $5 per $1,000 of value. As the
          purchase price goes up, the insurance premium goes down somewhat. In </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Chicago</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span
          >, by contrast, title insurance is more like $1 per $1000. Most of the
          difference goes as a commission to the title insurance agent, not to
          the person who is actually insuring it. The way lawyers did it was
          that the lawyer would search the title and come up with an opinion.
          The lawyer would take all the documents that he or she had looked at
          and put them in a binder: this would be the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">abstract of title</i>. This
          would either be given to the lender if there was a mortgage, or if
          there was no mortgage (or when it was paid off) it would be held by
          the purchaser. The next time there was a sale, the abstract would be
          given to the next lawyer, who would update it to the date of the new
          sale. This would continue as the property was sold, and the abstract
          got to be quite thick. As long as you don�t lose the abstract, the
          process was actually quite simple and inexpensive. Once you don�t need
          a lawyer to explain the hard stuff, the routine parts of the
          transaction drop away. So lawyers are, for the most part, out of the
          residential real estate business.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Residential real estate transactions almost always go off without a
          hitch. A lawyer might say that someone is taking a risk in buying or
          selling without legal advice, but the transactions very seldom result
          in litigation. In </span
        ><st1:place
          ><st1:PlaceName><span>Franklin</span></st1:PlaceName
          ><span> </span
          ><st1:PlaceName><span>County</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place
        ><span
          >, there are, on average, about 2,000 real estate transactions a
          month. In absolute terms, there�s a lot of litigation, but it�s a very
          small percentage of the transactions. Braunstein isn�t sure that
          lawyers add much to the cost. Does the title insurer perform the
          function that the lawyer used to? Not really. If you go and buy life
          insurance, the life insurance company doesn�t tell you to live a
          healthy life. They just say: give me the money, and here�s your
          policy. That�s the way title insurance companies work. There is no
          �advice� function. The title insurance companies write the policy,
          which often means a lot less than the insured thinks, and the title
          agent typically doesn�t explain it. If there�s a tough question, the
          title agent will probably advise getting a lawyer.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Who does the real estate broker represent? The broker typically
          represents the seller. The broker isn�t in a situation to advise the
          buyer, for example, �you shouldn�t buy this property because there�s a
          potential title defect!� It�s hard for the broker to give independent
          advice to the buyer. The broker represents the seller and it would be
          violating a duty to the seller to advise the buyer. Also, the buyer�s
          livelihood is contingent on closing the sale. So this is an unlikely
          source of independent advice for the buyer.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Buyers frequently say that they don�t need advice because the �real
          money� is coming not from the buyer but a lender who is putting up as
          much as 100% of the purchase price. So if the title and appraisal are
          good enough for the lender, why aren�t they good enough for the buyer?
          The bank looks at the collateral, but they also look at the borrower.
          Banks look at the transaction differently from borrowers. They know
          that a certain percentage of their loans will default and they�ll lose
          that money. But this is built into the interest rate. The bank can
          spread the risk over a whole bunch of people and a whole bunch of
          loans. The individual buying the house is not able to do that so
          easily.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There are some things that the bank might not care about that might
          be important to you, such as aspects that don�t affect the value of
          the real estate. Maybe you�d like to build a swimming pool but there
          is a restrictive covenant against building a pool. That wouldn�t
          affect the value of the property to the bank, but it would affect its
          value to you. The bank has no economic stake in whether you can use
          the property in the way you planned. In most transactions, the bank
          has a �cushion�. The buyer makes a down payment in most transactions.
          Even if there is a defect, the bank only cares whether the value of
          the collateral will be affected. If the value is cut by 5% but the
          bank has, for example, a 20% cushion from the down payment, then they
          won�t care. The risk of a bad title or undisclosed defect with respect
          to title turns out to be quite small, even though titles can be very
          complex.</span

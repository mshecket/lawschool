<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
exam will be similar to the one in Property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There will probably be a regular essay section, a short answer section
and a multiple choice section.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This exam
will be open book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Outline of the typical
transaction</span></b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
typical transaction involves a contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Even simple real estate transactions are more complex generally than transactions
involving personal property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
partly the result of tradition and partly the nature of the transaction itself
that makes it more difficult.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
typical deal starts, from the buyer’s perspective, with finding a property,
with or without the aid of a real estate agent or broker.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the overwhelming majority of cases, the
seller has already contracted with a real estate broker.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller will have entered into a listing
agreement that authorizes the broker to put up signs, etc. and hopefully bring
buyers forward.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>An aside: </span></i><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>A real estate agent is a
lesser qualification than a real estate broker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>An agent takes an exam and is licensed by the state to engage in that
practice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You don’t need any
experience.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But you have to do business
with a real estate broker, who needs to have been practicing for a certain
amount of time and have passed a certain more difficult exam.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So a real estate agent cannot practice on his
or her own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In terms of what we’re
studying, there is no difference between the agent and the broker and so we’ll
use the terms synonymously for the most part.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Note how this is different than the meaning of broker that you’ll find
in <a href="http://lawschool.mikeshecket.com/ba">BA</a>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Next,
the parties come together and decide that they’ve agreed on the property and
terms, and thus a contract must be prepared.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In residential transactions, the contract is almost always printed on a
standard form that is published jointly by the Bar Association and the Board of
Realtors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Braunstein says it’s not a bad
contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The idea is that there’s not
enough money involved in residential transactions to draw up a contract from
scratch every time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It doesn’t justify
having a lawyer involved because the transactions are pretty routine.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The parties can usually customize just a few
clauses themselves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In commercial transactions,
however, form contracts are rarely used, even for relatively simple
transactions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Big transactions begin to
justify the attorneys’ fees involved and negotiations that bring the two sides
together in their understanding of their agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Why
do you need a contract of sale?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
are two things going on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Banks don’t
want to get involved in a transaction until they know what the transaction
is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They don’t want to process a loan
until the property and terms are already determined (though this has changed in
the last 10 years with prequalification).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Also, the buyer won’t want to commit to purchase until financing is
secured.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The buyer doesn’t want to
unconditionally promise hundreds of thousands of dollars that the buyer doesn’t
have.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller has an incentive to
have a contract as well, even if it’s somewhat contingent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller is going to essentially take the property
off the market, and they want to make sure that the buyer is obligated to
secure financing and do their best to close the transaction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
other thing that distinguishes the transaction in the purchase of real as
opposed to personal property is the question of title.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We separate ownership from possession in the
law of real property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Someone who is in possession
of land may not own it or may not own the whole “bundle of sticks”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You must investigate title, which takes time
and costs money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Buyers don’t want to
take the time to investigate title and then find that the property is off the
market.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Title insurance works by telling
the title insurer what property you want.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They do a title search and then issue a title commitment, saying that if
you buy the property they will insure title on the property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Finally,
we come to closing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Closing describes
two different things: it describes, at least in some cases, a kind of
conference that takes place with the buyer, real estate agent and <span
class=GramE>title company</span> and frequently a bank representative.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You meet for the purpose of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fully executing </i>the transaction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we say a transaction is to close on a
certain date, we mean that all of the obligations of the contract are to be performed
on that date.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>The
obligations of the contract boil down to the buyer paying the money and the
seller delivering the deed.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
that point the contract becomes executed and is no longer executory.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The deed is then transferred.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Then documents have to be
recorded, particularly the deed and the mortgage.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawyers may handle this, but more frequently
the title company takes care of it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Closing memoranda and “bibles” are prepared.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And that’s it…unless there’s litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Role of the lawyer</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Lawyers
don’t play much of a role in residential real estate transactions anymore
because they’ve been driven out by title insurance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The most complex thing that the lawyer did
was give an opinion of title.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now that’s
done by title insurance companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
reason for this is that has the real estate market has become more national,
the demand for uniformity in documentation has become more important.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Title insurance is on a standard form
published by one or two different land title organizations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because they are regulated insurance
companies, title insurance companies must have a certain amount of assets to
back their liabilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>It
is sometimes asserted that title insurance is cheaper than a lawyer’s title
opinion, but Braunstein thinks that’s not necessarily clear.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Title insurance starts at $5 per $1,000 of
value.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the purchase price goes up,
the insurance premium goes down somewhat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Chicago</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
'>, by contrast, title insurance is more like $1 per
$1000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of the difference goes as a
commission to the title insurance agent, not to the person who is actually
insuring it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The way lawyers did it was
that the lawyer would search the title and come up with an opinion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawyer would take all the documents that
he or she had looked at and put them in a binder: this would be the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>abstract of title</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This would either be given to the lender if
there was a mortgage, or if there was no mortgage (or when it was paid off) it
would be held by the purchaser.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next
time there was a sale, the abstract would be given to the next lawyer, who
would update it to the date of the new sale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This would continue as the property was sold, and the abstract got to be
quite thick.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As long as you don’t lose
the abstract, the process was actually quite simple and inexpensive.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once you don’t need a lawyer to explain the
hard stuff, the routine parts of the transaction drop away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So lawyers are, for the most part, out of the
residential real estate business.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Residential
real estate transactions almost always go off without a hitch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A lawyer might say that someone is taking a
risk in buying or selling without legal advice, but the transactions very
seldom result in litigation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Franklin</span></st1:PlaceName><span
 style='font-size:14.0pt;'> </span><st1:PlaceName><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>County</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>, there are, on average,
about 2,000 real estate transactions a month.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In absolute terms, there’s a lot of litigation, but it’s a very small
percentage of the transactions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Braunstein isn’t sure that lawyers add much to the cost.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the title insurer perform the function
that the lawyer used to?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not
really.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you go and buy life
insurance, the life insurance company doesn’t tell you to live a healthy life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They just say: give me the money, and here’s
your policy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s the way title
insurance companies work.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no “advice”
function.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The title insurance companies
write the policy, which often means a lot less than the insured thinks, and the
title agent typically doesn’t explain it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If there’s a tough question, the title agent will probably advise
getting a lawyer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Who
does the real estate broker represent?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
broker typically represents the seller.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The broker isn’t in a situation to advise the buyer, for example, “you
shouldn’t buy this property because there’s a potential title defect!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s hard for the broker to give independent
advice to the buyer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The broker
represents the seller and it would be violating a duty to the seller to advise
the buyer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, the buyer’s livelihood
is contingent on closing the sale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
this is an unlikely source of independent advice for the buyer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Buyers
frequently say that they don’t need advice because the “real money” is coming
not from the buyer but a lender who is putting up as much as 100% of the
purchase price.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if the title and
appraisal are good enough for the lender, why aren’t they good enough for the
buyer?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bank looks at the collateral,
but they also look at the borrower.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Banks look at the transaction differently from borrowers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They know that a certain percentage of their
loans will default and they’ll lose that money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But this is built into the interest rate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bank can spread the risk over a whole
bunch of people and a whole bunch of loans.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The individual buying the house is not able to do that so easily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>There
are some things that the bank might not care about that might be important to
you, such as aspects that don’t affect the value of the real estate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe you’d like to build a swimming pool but
there is a restrictive covenant against building a pool.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That wouldn’t affect the value of the property
to the bank, but it would affect its value to you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bank has no economic stake in whether you
can use the property in the way you planned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In most transactions, the bank has a “cushion”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The buyer makes a down payment in most
transactions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if there is a defect,
the bank only cares whether the value of the collateral will be affected.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the value is cut by 5% but the bank has,
for example, a 20% cushion from the down payment, then they won’t care.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The risk of a bad title or undisclosed defect
with respect to title turns out to be quite small, even though titles can be
very complex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>There
are four types of listing agreements, at least as courts see it:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this is the most common, and certainly the one that the real estate agent or
broker most wants to get.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This means
that the broker gets a commission if the property is sold <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>to anyone, by anyone</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
get paid, for example, even if the property gets sold to a relative who you

even if the listing agent was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i>

sense that it is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>open to all agents</i>.<span

but essentially it means the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>proximate
cause</i> of the sale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Real estate
agents disfavor these listings, and it’s not hard to see why.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have an exclusive listing, you don’t
have to do anything because you can simply hope another agent comes
forward.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With an open listing, you can
do a lot of work and come away with no money if some other agent comes forward
as the procuring cause of the sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to “receipt for deposit”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does that
mean?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If someone gives the agent a check
along with an offer, they’ll give a receipt for it and they can deposit the
check in their checking account, earning interest.<span

pretty much the only duty the agent has!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

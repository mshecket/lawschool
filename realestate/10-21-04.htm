        <span
          >The secondary mortgage market started mostly after World War II.
          There was a big demand for residential mortgages. There was a big
          public policy in favor of ownership of single-family homes. Local
          banks loan money to individual mortgagees. But at some point, they run
          out of money: it�s all loaned out. The federal government created
          Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which are federally chartered
          corporations. These act as private companies, but they operate in the
          public interest. The FHA serves as a clearinghouse. When money goes to
          the borrower, you get a promissory note and mortgage from the borrower
          to the bank. Then the banks turn around and sell the promissory note
          and mortgage to the FHA, which pays them for it. Now, the bank has
          more money with which to make mortgage loans. The FHA turns around and
          sells the notes and mortgages to investors, which could be banks,
          insurance companies, or wealthy individuals. Mortgage notes are very
          safe investments. In the event of a foreclosure, the process sort of
          unravels.</span

        <b><span>Transfers by the mortgagee</span></b

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This is a more important issue currently than transfers by the
          mortgagor because due on sale clauses are now enforceable. Will the
          transfer of the promissory note alone constitute a transfer of the
          mortgage? Yeah, that�s the only thing that makes sense. Will a
          transfer of the mortgage alone also transfer the note? No, even though
          it leads to the same absurd situation. But when the later happens, it
          was probably an accident. Notes and mortgages are transferred in
          different ways. With notes, it depends on what kind of note it is. If
          the note transfers the mortgage, why bother having a separate
          assignment of the mortgage? You do it just to have something that can
          be recorded. Recordation isn�t as important as you might think, but it
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">is</i> important. The assignee
          wants the protection of recordation, and in order to have that, there
          must be some written instrument to record.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why would you want to transfer a note with the mortgage that secures
          it? One reason is that you might just want to sell it. You might
          rather have cash than the note. There are plenty of people out there
          who would rather have the promissory note as an investment than cash.
          So there�s a market there. Or maybe you want to use the promissory
          note and mortgage as security for some
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">other </i>debt. The promissory
          note is an asset you have, and you can use it as collateral just like
          any other asset.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Here are the two big issues: (1) Is the collateral assignment
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">perfected</i> under UCC Article
          9? Article 9 has nothing to do with the mortgage itself, but it does
          apply to creating a security interest in the promissory note. (2) Is
          the assignee a holder in due course? That would mean that you�re
          exempt from certain defenses that the original obligor may have; it�s
          a fairly desirable status. We need to distinguish fraud, though. There
          is garden-variety fraud, where you basically intentionally lie to get
          the promissory note. That�s a personal defense. The real defense with
          respect to fraud is when you sign the promissory note thinking that
          it�s something else. That�s called �fraud in the execution�. The
          requirements for a holder in due course are that the instrument must
          be negotiable, you must be the holder of the instrument, you must
          possess the instrument, and you must exhibit certain behavior. UCC �
          3-104(1) deals with negotiability. There is also other stuff.</span

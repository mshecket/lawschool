<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>How
can B get notice of A’s rights?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
are four ways: (1) actual knowledge, (2) recorded documents, (3) persons in possession,
or (4) the duty to inquire from any of the above.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The principal basis for the Recording Acts is
constructive or actual notice from recorded documents.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you look in the record, you’ll see things
and have notice that way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But even if
you don’t look in the record, you’re still deemed to know what you would have
known <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i> you had looked.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In order to get notice from the person in possession,
it must be somebody <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other than you’d
expect</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So what’s really the
difference between a race <span class=GramE>jurisdiction</span> versus a
race-notice or notice jurisdiction?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
you’re in a race state, you only have to look at the public record.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If an earlier deed is not of record, you know
that you’ll win.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a race-notice jurisdiction,
you must look not just at the public record, but also the property itself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If notice is required, then if there is
someone in possession inconsistent with the record title, you’ll be deemed to
know that for the purposes of determining whether you’re a bona fine purchaser.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

may not know everything, but you may know something.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There may be a recorded document that you
actually see, but it’s defective.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or you
might see someone on the property who isn’t the person selling it to you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A defectively recorded document still gives
you notice of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>something</i>: someone is
claiming an interest in the property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Once you see that, you’re required to make a reasonable investigation,
and you’re charged with notice of anything that <span class=GramE>a such</span>
an investigation would reveal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, you
might not have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>complete</i> notice, but
you may have enough notice to require you to dig deeper.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Only certain documents can be recorded, as
specified by the statutes, but the recorder will accept virtually anything.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Frequently, when there is a dispute
concerning title, an affidavit will be recorded saying a certain person claims interest
in the property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That doesn’t charge you
with notice because it’s outside the statute, but it creates the duty to
investigate the claim in the affidavit to see if they’re valid or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Let’s
say a neighbor informs a potential buyer about an unrecorded deed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then you have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>actual notice</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s say O
gives <span class=GramE>A</span> an unrecorded easement, then O takes out a mortgage
with X, and the mortgage mentions the easement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The mortgage is recorded.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
easement itself isn’t recorded, but a purchaser, if they search the record,
will be charged with at least inquiry notice of the easement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, what constitutes a reasonable
inquiry is a question of fact.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if
you don’t see <span class=GramE>the mortgage, then you’re</span> not charged
with inquiry notice and you’ll take free of the easement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>One
of the most common forms of notice is when you have someone in possession whose
possession is inconsistent with the record ownership.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, there’s a transfer from O to A
that’s unrecorded.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>O goes to sell the house
to B, but A is in possession.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>B is
charged with notice that something is wrong in a race-notice or notice jurisdiction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This happens all the time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What happens if it turns out that A is really
O’s son?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is that possession inconsistent
with the public record?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe A has a
short term lease.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You’re on notice that
there is a lease if you say that there is a tenant, and you are also on notice
of anything that a reasonable inquiry would reveal about the lease.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means you probably have to talk to all
the tenants or look at all their leases.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When people buy commercial buildings that are rented, they must get
information on all the tenants and what’s called an “estoppel letter” from each
tenant saying that they are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>only</i> a tenant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

don’t do a lot of the title search, but they do a lot of litigation with title
insurance companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Title insurance
companies typically do the title search.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Lawyers, when litigating or negotiating must understand how the system
works.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The way we do it is probably the
worst possible way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The system is
improving, but it’s happening slowly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In

somebody’s name is great.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You might make
things worse!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) Gradually, as a result

irrelevant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawyers and title companies

limitations for adverse possession.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
after a certain period of time, you won’t have to look at the old records at
all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The old records are “truly
disgusting”!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’re nasty!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’re kept in large books (both indices and
records themselves).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Without an index,
it would be utter chaos.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The indices are
kept in huge books.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everything in them

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
best way to do this sort of a fully computerized system would have been to have
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tract index</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tract index is simple.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Assuming you can identify the tract, which is
not hard in the western </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>, you give the tract a
number.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then you write down every
transaction that occurs involving that land.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You don’t have to worry about “wild deeds”, because it’s all right
there!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there are two problems with
the tract index: (1) <span class=GramE>It’s</span> expensive to administer
because you must make sure that each document is being recorded under the right
tract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There must be someone in the
office <span class=GramE>who</span> can double check these things, especially
considering that one big tract in 1900 could be 1,000 little tracts in
2000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Keeping track of the tracts is not
an easy process.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the western </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The problem is that if you have a
survey based on metes and bounds, it becomes impossible to have a tract
index.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We started out not being able to
use a tract index even though many western states could have done so early
on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There may be a simultaneous tract index
maintained in some states, but it is not the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

grantee-grantor index is difficult to use, but easy to maintain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You make a copy of the record that’s filed,
and then fill the index.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The clerk doesn’t
need a lot of special training and shouldn’t have to exercise <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> discretion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the index, you have the type of
instrument, the grantee’s name, the grantor’s name, information on where you
can find the document, and what tract of land the document relates to.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The grantee index is same thing, except for
how they’re alphabetized.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The grantor’s

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
whole premise of the system is that you can’t own the property unless you were
the government or unless you were previously a grantee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Somebody must have conveyed the land to
you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Your goal is to establish a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>chain of title</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You want to say, starting today in 2004, we
have a method of search to determine everyone who has been an owner or owned an
interest in a certain property from some date forward.<span

interested in now (for example, the buyer is interested in the seller) is the
current owner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So you work
backwards.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You only know who the current
owner is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we looked at the general warranty
deed, it included a blank for the book and page of the prior instrument.<span

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>So
you start in the grantee index, starting today, and you look backwards in
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At some point, you should find that
O, the person you’re getting ready to buy from, was a grantee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You get the deed itself and make sure it’s
valid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then you’re done with looking
under O’s name in the grantee index.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
it’s B that was O’s grantor (you find a transfer from B to O), then you must
ask: how did B become the owner of the property?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At some previous date, B must have been a grantee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So you look in the grantee index under B’s
name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You keep looking and find that B
was a grantee and A had previously conveyed the property to B.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>So you start looking under
A’s name.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You keep looking back
until you find a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>patent</i> (a deed from
the government) or you just look back the customary time period in the jurisdiction
where you’re working.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You’ll find that
the grantor was previously a grantee, and then whoever conveyed the property to
that earlier grantor was <span class=GramE>herself</span> a grantee, and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

we’ve established a chain of title!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
that doesn’t give you the whole picture!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The next problem is that under the Recording Acts, O only has good title
if O and everyone in the chain of title was a bona fine purchaser.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if we’re in a race-notice jurisdiction, we
must look at B and make sure that B’s deed was recorded prior to any other deed
from A.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We must make sure that no one in
this chain of title sold the property to someone <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>outside</i> of the chain of title prior to selling it to the next
person in the chain of title.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We have to
make sure A didn’t sell to X before <span class=GramE>A</span> sold it to B.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the next step is to start with <span

index, and search until we find the recorded deed to B.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we find a deed to X before the deed to B,
then we have big problems!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That would
mean that B, at least in a race-notice or race jurisdiction, is a “loser” and
didn’t get good title!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a notice jurisdiction,
it will be a little more complicated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

</span>You’re no longer concerned with any transfers from A because at this
point we’ve discovered that B was first to record and thus has “won”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So you start searching under B’s name and search
until you find a transfer from B to O.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You shouldn’t find anything intervening.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That would mean that O acquired good title.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then you search under O’s name from the time
O acquired title until the present, which would mean that O is the owner of an
unencumbered fee simple absolute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s
not going to be this simple or clean in practice, though.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are a lot of possibilities of transfers that you won’t find using the standard
technique that we’ve just discussed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What if the deed isn’t indexed at all?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What if you have a deed from O to A that is recorded, but <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not indexed</i>, <span class=GramE>then</span>
you have a deed from O to B.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>B has two
choices: B can look through <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>every deed</i>,
or look at the index.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s no way you
would do it without the index.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But in
this situation, searching the index won’t help B because the recorder’s office
made a mistake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Who wins?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some states would say that B loses, but
Braunstein thinks that’s dumb.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mere
recordation of the instrument doesn’t do you any good unless you have a way to
find it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can’t say B has notice of
something that’s impossible to find!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What do you do if you’re a careful attorney?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A has a potential problem: there’s a transfer
from O to A, A has recorded.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if you’re
<span class=GramE>A</span> you better check the records to make sure that the
deed was both <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>recorded</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>indexed</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is a cheap process that A should undertake.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s why A should lose if he doesn’t do
this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In some states, the index isn’t
considered part of the public record at all, and B loses, and Braunstein thinks
that’s dumb.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>wildest</i> deed, because there’s no way to
find it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at all</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

doesn’t have any actual notice of the unrecorded deed from B to Y.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The problem is that there is a deed in the
record.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s a recording of the
transfer from Y to Z, but C has no reason to look in the index under “Y”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When C is getting ready to purchase from B,
he looks in the grantee index and finds that B was a grantee from A.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He also finds that A was a grantor to B.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no transfer between when A acquired
it and when it was sold to B.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s no
transfer from B on the books.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore,
it appears that the title is clean.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How
do you decide that C ought to win over Z?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You could argue that both of them are innocent parties.<span

search.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What should Z have done?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Z should have had Y record the deed.<span

statute says that the only people who can take advantage of the Recording Acts

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>C has no practical way to find out about the
transfer from B to Y and then Y to Z.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Z
can find out there’s a problem and solve it rather cheaply.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be very expensive for C to solve the
problem.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The policy is that we ought to
put the loss on the least cost avoider, which is what will tend to make the Recording
Acts effective.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>C can’t say that his
deed was first recorded.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we deem Z’s
deed as unrecorded.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What we do is that
we read into the statute (sometimes because it’s there and sometimes because courts
imply it) that deeds must be “duly” or “properly” recorded.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We say that Z knew that there was a break in
the chain of title and that Z should have done something to fix it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Therefore, C, who took without notice and
recorded before Z straightened the situation up, prevails.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we had a tract index, then C would have
notice!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>C would see everything except
the transfer from B to Y.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
particular wild deed problem would be solved by the tract index.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

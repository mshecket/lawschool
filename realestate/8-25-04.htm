          didn�t have any kind of recording system until 1925. Then they had a
          registry system. The idea is that you can look at title and know
          exactly who owns what. The purpose of the statute of frauds was to
          start a publicly maintained recording system that would enable people
          to ascertain the title to real property, which you can�t do without
          writings: you can�t make a public record out of livery of
          seisin.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >There are two different kinds of real estate contracts. There�s the
          marketing contract (or purchase and sale agreement) and the contract
          for deed/installment contract. The latter is not a purchase and sale
          agreement at all: it�s essentially a mortgage or a security device
          <span class="GramE">like a mortgages</span>. We�ll put it off until
          after we�ve already covered mortgages. With the marketing contract,
          the parties contemplate that they�ll sign the agreement, which is
          highly conditional (like the one in the text), and then as soon as the
          contingencies are satisfied, there will be a closing, consideration
          will be paid in full, and the deed will be transferred. So the
          contract won�t have a long life before being fully executed. The
          contract for deed essentially says that the contract will remain in
          effect for a certain period of years, which may be a long time. The
          legal title to the property will be in the vendor until the vendee
          pays the consideration in full. The vendee will pay a certain amount
          of money per month. If all payments are made, then the vendee keeps
          the property. If the payments aren�t made, the vendee gets tossed out
          and the vendor keeps the property. Mostly, we�ll be talking about the
          marketing contract.</span

        <span>The most frequently used marketing contract in </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Columbus</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          is on the Columbus Bar Association website. Note that on page 20 there
          is a seller disclosure and buyer inspection clause. What�s the point
          of that? What�s the ulterior motive? One purpose is to get hidden
          defects out on the table. The main force for getting this included is
          protection for the agent. This clause requires the seller to disclose
          everything and submit to the buyer the seller�s disclosure form. Real
          estate agents are in a legally untenable position: they represent the
          seller, and their loyalty is to the seller, but they also have a duty
          to disclosure material defects to the buyer. That creates big time
          conflicts of interest! What�s happened is that the standard form
          contract is used to attempt to shift the liability for failure to
          disclose exclusively on the seller and get the real estate agent off
          the hook.</span

        <span
          >There�s an integration clause at the end of the contract. Are such
          clauses effective for real estate contracts? Is it legally enforceable
          to say that they can�t amend their agreement? What about oral
          modifications? You can orally rescind, but you can�t orally modify.

            enforceability of the contract.</span

          Braunstein thinks this is kind of dumb. Modifications seem frequently
          more trivial than rescission. Modifications are like a new contract:
          that�s why they have to be in writing. But there�s an exception!
          There�s always the possibility of equitable estoppel.</span

          >This is a suit for specific performance. This is an installment
          contract because land is being purchased in installments. The purchase
          price is $357 per acre. Is this contract complete enough to enforce?
          When is the deed to be delivered? You can infer that the contract was
          that the deed was to be delivered when the final payment had been
          made, which would make it look more like an installment contract than
          a marketing contract. Does the contract of sale have to be in writing?
          No, but there must be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">something</i> in writing that�s
          evidence that there<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> was</i> a
          contract. The statute of frauds clearly does
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> require that the
          contract be in writing. It
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">does</i> require that some note
          or memorandum of the contract be in writing. There can be some terms
          that are oral or determined by the courts, but there are some terms
          that must be in the note or memorandum in order to make it
          enforceable. But what are these terms? How specific were they here?
          <span class="GramE"
            >�80 acres land in the rear��not very specific.</span
          >
          They also have a legal description. But there are lots of Section 31s,
          lots of Township 27s and Ranges 28, all over the country! But we can
          combine this with information from the taxing authority. Once we know
          it�s in a county or municipality, then we know where the land
          is.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >This description would be inadequate for a deed because it doesn�t
          describe
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">one and only one</i> parcel of
          land. When we�re putting something into public records, we need a
          greater degree of certainty than when we have an agreement between two
          people. Some courts, however, would say that the requirement is the
          same. But this court doesn�t adopt that standard. This court takes a
          looser standard and says that the property only need be identified
          with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">reasonable</i> certainty.
          There must also be an indication of how much money was to be paid.
          It�s not hard to determine the price. So it�s not specified precisely,
          but it�s easy enough to compute. There must be a promise, subject
          matter, consideration, and price. What�s the difference between the
          consideration, price, and promise? What else is left for consideration
          once price and promise are taken into account? Braunstein thinks you
          need the price, and the essential promise which is to turn over the
          deed when the full payment has been made.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Was there really a contract for the sale of land here? Why wasn�t it
          a lease? Well, it has this percentage rate. It seems clear that there
          is a contract here and we know with some certainty what the terms of
          the agreement are. There doesn�t seem to be much reason not to enforce
          it. What�s the internal coherence requirement? How many documents are
          relied on here to prove the contract? The vendor kept copies of all
          the checks and a sort of �matrix� of records of payments. The court
          puts all the writings together and say that all of them taken together
          constitute the note or memorandum required by the statute of frauds.
          The court doesn�t tell us much about internal coherence. Normally,
          it�s required that there is some reference in the writings that they
          deal with the same subject matter. That�s clear here in that many of
          the documents are copies of each other.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The executor claims that the price is inadequate. Is that a statute
          of frauds claim? Keep in mind that when you win on the statute of
          frauds, all you�ve done is establish that there was an oral agreement
          that the court <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">can</i> legally
          enforce. You haven�t proved your case, because this is a suit for
          specific performance. You must prove all the elements that are
          required for enforcement of the contract. So the defendant tries to
          claim that the contract is inequitable. But the court says: this is an
          affirmative defense, and the defendant didn�t introduce any evidence
          about it. Inadequacy will be a successful affirmative defense if the
          price is shockingly inadequate. But there was no evidence that would
          either shock or not shock the court. If the price isn�t inadequate,
          you must show some other way that the contract was inequitable.</span

          satisfy the statute of frauds? It�s clear that a sale is intended. We
          know that the promise is for a sale. The memorandum must be signed by
          the party to be charged. Is �Love Barb� a signature? What�s a
          signature? Is it a mark that is intended to give legal significance to
          the document? That seems to be the case here, but the letter seems
          pretty informal. It looks kind of like a preliminary negotiation. But
          Diane and Jim call up and want to buy the property. If
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">they</i> back out, then Barb is
          stuck because there is no memorandum signed by them.</span

          that be enough to have a writing that satisfies the statute of frauds?
          Can you electronically sign over the telephone? Under the Electronic
          Records Act, the mark is defined in that it can be an electronic
          signal instead of a pencil or pen mark. But there also still needs to
          be intent: was this mark

            >Just a note or memorandum of the writing, and maybe not even that
            in the case of part performance.</span
          >
          Does the statute of frauds require the seller to sign the writing? Not
          in most states. Only the �party to be charged� needs to sign. You
          don�t know who has to sign the memorandum until you know who�s
          enforcing it. If one party can enforce the contract, the other one
          can�t necessarily enforce it too. It�s perfectly conceivable that only
          one person will have signed the agreement, or note or memorandum of
          the agreement. That�s a very exceptional circumstance in the law.
          Usually, if one person can enforce against the other, then there is
          mutuality of remedy and the other person can enforce too. But only one
          side in this case can prove the contract exists!</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Must the writing be introduced into evidence in any action to enforce
          the contract? Not necessarily. The memorandum might have been
          destroyed. You could just introduce evidence that there once existed
          such a note or memorandum. You�d need a pretty darn good explanation,
          but just because you don�t still have the writing doesn�t mean you
          have a legal difficulty with the statute of frauds; you just have an
          evidentiary difficulty.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Note that the statute of frauds is an affirmative defense. The
          statute of frauds doesn�t require a single writing. What about a
          judicial agreement? If the purpose of the statute of frauds is
          evidentiary, then if you admit there was a contract there�s probably
          sufficient evidence that the contract existed. That ought to be
          enough. But what�s wrong with that? It encourages perjury! Instead of
          saying that we had an agreement but it�s not in writing, you simply
          lie! The states split on this. There are at least some states where a
          judicial admission would not be enough and could not be used to
          satisfy the statute of frauds for that reason.</span

        <span

          mean that there is no contract. The purchaser can still get rescission
          and restitution. You could argue, however, that this is based on an
          idea of unjust enrichment. But then there is also the part performance
          doctrine. Even if you have the statute of frauds, there are lots of
          exceptions, such as easements by implication or necessity that don�t
          have to be in writing but are enforceable.</span

          <span class="GramE">are actually performance</span>? Is partial
          payment of the purchase price performance of the contract? It depends
          on when the payment is due under the contract. It sounds like,
          usually, that would be performance of the contract. But not taking
          possession: you can own land and never even see it. And not making
          improvements, for the same reason. Why should the vendor care if you
          make improvements to a house that they�re selling to you?

          There are lots of things that would establish the part performance
          doctrine. We have all three of the things we just mentioned! The court
          will enforce the agreement and the parents lose their house! The
          theory for the part performance exception is to protect reliance and
          prevent unjust enrichment. Does this make much sense? In practice,
          we�ve gone much further than protecting the reliance interest. But
          here, they invested $2400 and got the whole house, which gives them a
          lot more than their reliance interest. Why don�t we just give them
          $2400 instead of the whole benefit of the bargain? The second
          rationale the court uses is that people don�t do these acts unless
          they believe that the house is going to be theirs forever. If you use
          the evidentiary requirement, it�s a higher burden of proof because the
          acts can�t be ambiguous. Anytime you have these acts, there will be a
          question as to whether there is a temporary right of possession as
          opposed to a sale.</span

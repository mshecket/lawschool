recording system until 1925.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then they
had a registry system.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The idea is that
you can look at title and know exactly who owns what.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The purpose of the statute of frauds was to
start a publicly maintained recording system that would enable people to ascertain
the title to real property, which you can’t do without writings: you can’t make
a public record out of livery of seisin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>There
are two different kinds of real estate contracts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s the marketing contract (or purchase
and sale agreement) and the contract for deed/installment contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The latter is not a purchase and sale
agreement at all: it’s essentially a mortgage or a security device <span
class=GramE>like a mortgages</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’ll
put it off until after we’ve already covered mortgages.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With the marketing contract, the parties
contemplate that they’ll sign the agreement, which is highly conditional (like
the one in the text), and then as soon as the contingencies are satisfied,
there will be a closing, consideration will be paid in full, and the deed will
be transferred.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the contract won’t
have a long life before being fully executed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The contract for deed essentially says that the contract will remain in
effect for a certain period of years, which may be a long time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The legal title to the property will be in
the vendor until the vendee pays the consideration in full.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The vendee will pay a certain amount of money
per month.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If all payments are made,
then the vendee keeps the property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
the payments aren’t made, the vendee gets tossed out and the vendor keeps the property.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mostly, we’ll be talking about the marketing
contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
most frequently used marketing contract in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Columbus</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> is on the Columbus Bar
Association website.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that on page
20 there is a seller disclosure and buyer inspection clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the point of that?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the ulterior motive?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One purpose is to get hidden defects out on
the table.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The main force for getting
this included is protection for the agent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This clause requires the seller to disclose everything and submit to the
buyer the seller’s disclosure form.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Real
estate agents are in a legally untenable position: they represent the seller,
and their loyalty is to the seller, but they also have a duty to disclosure
material defects to the buyer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
creates big time conflicts of interest!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s
happened is that the standard form contract is used to attempt to shift the liability
for failure to disclose exclusively on the seller and get the real estate agent
off the hook.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>There’s
an integration clause at the end of the contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Are such clauses effective for real estate contracts?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is it legally enforceable to say that they
can’t amend their agreement?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about
oral modifications?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can orally
rescind, but you can’t orally modify.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>The agreement that’s you’re making doesn’t have to do with the
enforceability of the contract.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Braunstein thinks this is kind of dumb.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Modifications seem frequently more trivial than rescission.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Modifications are like a new contract: that’s
why they have to be in writing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
there’s an exception!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s always the
possibility of equitable estoppel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>This
is a suit for specific performance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
is an installment contract because land is being purchased in
installments.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The purchase price is $357
per acre.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is this contract complete
enough to enforce?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When is the deed to
be delivered?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can infer that the contract
was that the deed was to be delivered when the final payment had been made,
which would make it look more like an installment contract than a marketing
contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the contract of sale have
to be in writing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, but there must be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>something</i> in writing that’s evidence
that there<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> was</i> a contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute of frauds clearly does <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> require that the contract be in
writing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>does</i> require that some note or memorandum of the contract be in
writing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There can be some terms that
are oral or determined by the courts, but there are some terms that must be in
the note or memorandum in order to make it enforceable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what are these terms?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How specific were they here?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>“80 acres land in the rear”…not
very specific.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They also have a
legal description.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there are lots of
Section 31s, lots of Township 27s and Ranges 28, all over the country!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we can combine this with information from
the taxing authority.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once we know it’s
in a county or municipality, then we know where the land is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>This
description would be inadequate for a deed because it doesn’t describe <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>one and only one</i> parcel of land.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we’re putting something into public
records, we need a greater degree of certainty than when we have an agreement
between two people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some courts,
however, would say that the requirement is the same.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this court doesn’t adopt that
standard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This court takes a looser
standard and says that the property only need be identified with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i> certainty.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There must also be an indication of how much
money was to be paid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s not hard to
determine the price.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So it’s not
specified precisely, but it’s easy enough to compute.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There must be a promise, subject matter, consideration,
and price.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the difference between
the consideration, price, and promise?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What else is left for consideration once price and promise are taken
into account?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Braunstein thinks you need
the price, and the essential promise which is to turn over the deed when the
full payment has been made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Was
there really a contract for the sale of land here?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why wasn’t it a lease?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, it has this percentage rate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems clear that there is a contract here
and we know with some certainty what the terms of the agreement are.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There doesn’t seem to be much reason not to enforce
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the internal coherence
requirement?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How many documents are
relied on here to prove the contract?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
vendor kept copies of all the checks and a sort of “matrix” of records of
payments.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court puts all the
writings together and say that all of them taken together constitute the note
or memorandum required by the statute of frauds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court doesn’t tell us much about internal
coherence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Normally, it’s required that
there is some reference in the writings that they deal with the same subject
matter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s clear here in that many
of the documents are copies of each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The
executor claims that the price is inadequate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Is that a statute of frauds claim?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Keep in mind that when you win on the statute of frauds, all you’ve done
is establish that there was an oral agreement that the court <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> legally enforce.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You haven’t proved your case, because this is
a suit for specific performance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
must prove all the elements that are required for enforcement of the contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the defendant tries to claim that the contract
is inequitable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the court says: this
is an affirmative defense, and the defendant didn’t introduce any evidence
about it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Inadequacy will be a
successful affirmative defense if the price is shockingly inadequate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there was no evidence that would either
shock or not shock the court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the
price isn’t inadequate, you must show some other way that the contract was
inequitable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does this letter satisfy the “essential”
elements to satisfy the statute of frauds?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s clear that a sale is intended.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We know that the promise is for a sale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The memorandum must be signed by the party to be charged.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is “Love Barb” a signature?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s a signature?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is it a mark that is intended to give legal
significance to the document?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That seems
to be the case here, but the letter seems pretty informal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It looks kind of like a preliminary
negotiation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Diane and Jim call up
and want to buy the property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>they</i> back out, then Barb is stuck
because there is no memorandum signed by them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>What
if there was an exchange of e-mails?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What if this same note had been e-mailed to Diane and Jim and they had
responded with “OK”?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would that be
enough to have a writing that satisfies the statute of frauds?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can you electronically sign over the
telephone?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under the Electronic Records
Act, the mark is defined in that it can be an electronic signal instead of a
pencil or pen mark.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there also still
needs to be intent: was this mark <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intended</i>
to be a signature?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Does
the statute of frauds require a contract to be in writing?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>Just a note or memorandum of the writing, and maybe not even that
in the case of part performance.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Does the statute of frauds require the seller to sign the writing?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not in most states.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Only the “party to be charged” needs to
sign.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You don’t know who has to sign the
memorandum until you know who’s enforcing it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If one party can enforce the contract, the other one can’t necessarily enforce
it too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s perfectly conceivable that
only one person will have signed the agreement, or note or memorandum of the
agreement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a very exceptional
circumstance in the law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Usually, if one
person can enforce against the other, then there is mutuality of remedy and the
other person can enforce too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But only
one side in this case can prove the contract exists!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Must
the writing be introduced into evidence in any action to enforce the contract?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not necessarily.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The memorandum might have been destroyed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could just introduce evidence that there
once existed such a note or memorandum.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You’d need a pretty darn good explanation, but just because you don’t
still have the writing doesn’t mean you have a legal difficulty with the statute
of frauds; you just have an evidentiary difficulty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Note
that the statute of frauds is an affirmative defense.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The statute of frauds doesn’t require a
single writing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about a judicial
agreement?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the purpose of the statute
of frauds is evidentiary, then if you admit there was a contract there’s
probably sufficient evidence that the contract existed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That ought to be enough.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what’s wrong with that?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It encourages perjury!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead of saying that we had an agreement
but it’s not in writing, you simply lie!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The states split on this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
are at least some states where a judicial admission would not be enough and
could not be used to satisfy the statute of frauds for that reason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>If
the statute of frauds is not satisfied, it doesn’t necessarily mean that there
is no contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The purchaser can still
get rescission and restitution.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
could argue, however, that this is based on an idea of unjust enrichment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But then there is also the part performance
doctrine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if you have the statute
of frauds, there are lots of exceptions, such as easements by implication or
necessity that don’t have to be in writing but are enforceable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>There
are three acts of part performance, and you need two of them: (1) partial
payment of the price, (2) taking possession, and (3) making substantial
improvements on the land.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Which of these
<span class=GramE>are actually performance</span>?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is partial payment of the purchase price performance
of the contract?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It depends on when the
payment is due under the contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
sounds like, usually, that would be performance of the contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But not taking possession: you can own land
and never even see it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And not making
improvements, for the same reason.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why
should the vendor care if you make improvements to a house that they’re selling

two aren’t typically performance of the agreement.</span><span

things we just mentioned!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court will
enforce the agreement and the parents lose their house!<span

is to protect reliance and prevent unjust enrichment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does this make much sense?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In practice, we’ve gone much further than
protecting the reliance interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
here, they invested $2400 and got the whole house, which gives them a lot more
than their reliance interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why don’t
we just give them $2400 instead of the whole benefit of the bargain?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The second rationale the court uses is that
people don’t do these acts unless they believe that the house is going to be
theirs forever.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you use the
evidentiary requirement, it’s a higher burden of proof because the acts can’t
be ambiguous.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anytime you have these
acts, there will be a question as to whether there is a temporary right of possession
as opposed to a sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

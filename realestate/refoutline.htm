really become much more <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>national</i> in
the last 30-40 years for a number of reasons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Why was it the way it
was?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawyers are typically licensed

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The same thing was traditionally true for
banks and savings &amp; loans.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were
licensed locally and they only loaned in the area in which they did
business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were local lenders under
local law, and that worked to insulate the law of one state from another.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But things have changed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The lawyer, especially in a
residential transaction, has become less and less important, at least when it
comes to the buyer and seller.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
lender and title insurance company are represented by counsel, but not the
buyer and seller.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the locality makes
less of a difference.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, banks now
operate nationally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Depression-era bank
restrictions and regulations have been relaxed, and you see more and more <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>national</i> lenders.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>National lenders want <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>standardization</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every
lender wants to standardize the process as much as possible to reduce
transactions costs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you dont need
separate processes and forms for different states, it doesnt cost as much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Another change is the rise of
title insurance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After World War II,
there was a big population increase and federal policies designed to encourage
people to buy single-family homes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
was a lot of development, especially out West, that was not near established
financial institutions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The major </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

style='font-size:11.0pt'>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Insurance companies
stepped up to the plate!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Theyre
national lenders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They have lots of
money to invest and could invest nationally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The insurance companies thought: how do we know title opinions are any
good?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if an attorney makes a
mistake?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Will the attorney be able to
pay the damages suffered due to a bad title opinion?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lending insurance companies like Prudential
and Equitable decided not to rely on local lawyers, but instead buy insurance
themselves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once you take a lawyer out
of giving an opinion on title, they have less of a role in transactions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The Federal Housing
Authority, Fannie Mae, Farmers Home Loan Board and so on are
federally-chartered organizations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
act as a private corporation but are infused with public interest and public
policy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their debts are backed by the
federal government.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The FHA wants to
help finance this real estate development thats going on, particularly
residential real estate development after the war.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They make a deal where they agree to buy
mortgages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you borrow some money in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> and that bank runs out of money to lend, then thats
okay, but the next person who wants to buy a house wont be able to.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the FHA buys the mortgages.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whoever the home purchaser was will owe the
FHA the money, and the FHA will give the money back to the bank.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The FHA has a big demand, just like the
insurance companies, for uniformity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When the FHA is buying mortgages, they want every single one to be the
same so they dont have to read each one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They want to know if its a certain type of FHA-approved mortgage, and
then theyll know that its acceptable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Banks insist on these because even if they dont decide to sell the
mortgage to the FHA or Fannie Mae, they might, and they insist that virtually
all mortgages be on the FHA form.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The typical transaction
involves a contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even simple real
estate transactions are more complex generally than transactions involving
personal property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is partly the result
of tradition and partly the nature of the transaction itself that makes it more
difficult.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The typical deal starts, from
the buyers perspective, with finding a property, with or without the aid of a
real estate agent or broker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the
overwhelming majority of cases, the seller has already contracted with a real
estate broker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller will have
entered into a listing agreement that authorizes the broker to put up signs,
etc. and hopefully bring buyers forward.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>An aside: </span></i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>A
real estate agent is a lesser qualification than a real estate broker.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>An agent takes an exam and is licensed by the
state to engage in that practice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
dont need any experience.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But you have
to do business with a real estate broker, who needs to have been practicing for
a certain amount of time and have passed a certain more difficult exam.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So a real estate agent cannot practice on his
or her own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In terms of what were
studying, there is no difference between the agent and the broker and so well
use the terms synonymously for the most part.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Note how this is different than the meaning of broker that youll find
in BA.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Next, the parties come
together and decide that theyve agreed on the property and terms, and thus a
contract must be prepared.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
residential transactions, the contract is almost always printed on a standard
form that is published jointly by the Bar Association and the Board of
Realtors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Braunstein says its not a bad
contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The idea is that theres not
enough money involved in residential transactions to draw up a contract from
scratch every time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It doesnt justify
having a lawyer involved because the transactions are pretty routine.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The parties can usually customize just a few
clauses themselves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In commercial
transactions, however, form contracts are rarely used, even for relatively
simple transactions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Big transactions
begin to justify the attorneys fees involved and negotiations that bring the
two sides together in their understanding of their agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Why do you need a contract of
sale?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are two things going
on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Banks dont want to get involved in
a transaction until they know what the transaction is.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They dont want to process a loan until the
property and terms are already determined (though this has changed in the last
10 years with prequalification).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also,
the buyer wont want to commit to purchase until financing is secured.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The buyer doesnt want to unconditionally
promise hundreds of thousands of dollars that the buyer doesnt have.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller has an incentive to have a
contract as well, even if its somewhat contingent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller is going to essentially take the
property off the market, and they want to make sure that the buyer is obligated
to secure financing and do their best to close the transaction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The other thing that
distinguishes the transaction in the purchase of real as opposed to personal
property is the question of title.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
separate ownership from possession in the law of real property.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Someone who is in possession of land may not
own it or may not own the whole bundle of sticks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You must investigate title, which takes time
and costs money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Buyers dont want to
take the time to investigate title and then find that the property is off the
market.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Title insurance works by telling
the title insurer what property you want.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They do a title search and then issue a title commitment, saying that if
you buy the property they will insure title on the property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Finally, we come to
closing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Closing describes two different
things: it describes, at least in some cases, a kind of conference that takes
place with the buyer, real estate agent and <span class=GramE>title company</span>
and frequently a bank representative.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You meet for the purpose of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fully
executing </i>the transaction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we
say a transaction is to close on a certain date, we mean that all of the
obligations of the contract are to be performed on that date.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>The obligations of the
contract boil down to the buyer paying the money and the seller delivering the
deed.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that point the contract
becomes executed and is no longer executory.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The deed is then transferred.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>Then documents have to be recorded, particularly the deed and the
mortgage.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawyers may handle
this, but more frequently the title company takes care of it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Closing memoranda and bibles are
prepared.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And thats itunless theres litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Role of the lawyer</span></b><span style='font-size:
11.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Lawyers dont play much of a
role in residential real estate transactions anymore because theyve been
driven out by title insurance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The most
complex thing that the lawyer did was give an opinion of title.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now thats done by title insurance
companies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The reason for this is that
has the real estate market has become more national, the demand for uniformity
in documentation has become more important.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Title insurance is on a standard form published by one or two different
land title organizations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because they
are regulated insurance companies, title insurance companies must have a
certain amount of assets to back their liabilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>It is sometimes asserted that
title insurance is cheaper than a lawyers title opinion, but Braunstein thinks
thats not necessarily clear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Title
insurance starts at $5 per $1,000 of value.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As the purchase price goes up, the insurance premium goes down somewhat.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Chicago</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, by contrast, title insurance is more like $1 per
$1000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of the difference goes as a
commission to the title insurance agent, not to the person who is actually
insuring it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The way lawyers did it was
that the lawyer would search the title and come up with an opinion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawyer would take all the documents that he
or she had looked at and put them in a binder: this would be the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>abstract of title</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This would either be given to the lender if
there was a mortgage, or if there was no mortgage (or when it was paid off) it
would be held by the purchaser.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next
time there was a sale, the abstract would be given to the next lawyer, who
would update it to the date of the new sale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This would continue as the property was sold, and the abstract got to be
quite thick.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As long as you dont lose
the abstract, the process was actually quite simple and inexpensive.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once you dont need a lawyer to explain the
hard stuff, the routine parts of the transaction drop away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So lawyers are, for the most part, out of the
residential real estate business.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Residential real estate transactions
almost always go off without a hitch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A
lawyer might say that someone is taking a risk in buying or selling without
legal advice, but the transactions very seldom result in litigation.<span

style='font-size:11.0pt'>, there are, on average, about 2,000 real estate
transactions a month.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In absolute terms,
theres a lot of litigation, but its a very small percentage of the
transactions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Braunstein isnt sure that
lawyers add much to the cost.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the
title insurer perform the function that the lawyer used to?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not really.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you go and buy life insurance, the life insurance company doesnt
tell you to live a healthy life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
just say: give me the money, and heres your policy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thats the way title insurance companies
work.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no advice function.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The title insurance companies write the
policy, which often means a lot less than the insured thinks, and the title
agent typically doesnt explain it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
theres a tough question, the title agent will probably advise getting a
lawyer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Who does the real estate
broker represent?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The broker typically
represents the seller.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The broker isnt
in a situation to advise the buyer, for example, you shouldnt buy this
property because theres a potential title defect!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its hard for the broker to give independent
advice to the buyer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The broker
represents the seller and it would be violating a duty to the seller to advise
the buyer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, the buyers livelihood
is contingent on closing the sale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
this is an unlikely source of independent advice for the buyer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Buyers frequently say that
they dont need advice because the real money is coming not from the buyer
but a lender who is putting up as much as 100% of the purchase price.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if the title and appraisal are good enough
for the lender, why arent they good enough for the buyer?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bank looks at the collateral, but they
also look at the borrower.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Banks look at
the transaction differently from borrowers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They know that a certain percentage of their loans will default and
theyll lose that money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this is
built into the interest rate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bank
can spread the risk over a whole bunch of people and a whole bunch of
loans.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The individual buying the house
is not able to do that so easily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are some things that
the bank might not care about that might be important to you, such as aspects
that dont affect the value of the real estate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Maybe youd like to build a swimming pool but there is a restrictive
covenant against building a pool.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
wouldnt affect the value of the property to the bank, but it would affect its
value to you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bank has no economic
stake in whether you can use the property in the way you planned.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In most transactions, the bank has a cushion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The buyer makes a down payment in most
transactions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if there is a defect,
the bank only cares whether the value of the collateral will be affected.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the value is cut by 5% but the bank has,
for example, a 20% cushion from the down payment, then they wont care.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The risk of a bad title or undisclosed defect
with respect to title turns out to be quite small, even though titles can be
very complex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

contract was that the deed was to be delivered when the final payment had been
made, which would make it look more like an installment contract than a
marketing contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the contract of
sale have to be in writing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, but
there must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>something</i> in writing

are oral or determined by the courts, but there are some terms that must be in
the note or memorandum in order to make it enforceable.<span

are lots of Section 31s, lots of Township 27s and Ranges 28, all over the

information from the taxing authority.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

degree of certainty than when we have an agreement between two people.<span

requirement is the same.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But this court
doesnt adopt that standard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This court
takes a looser standard and says that the property only need be identified with
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i> certainty.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There must also be an indication of how much
money was to be paid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its not hard to
determine the price.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So its not
specified precisely, but its easy enough to compute.<span

consideration, and price.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whats the

defense, and the defendant didnt introduce any evidence about it.<span

defense if the price is shockingly inadequate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But there was no evidence that would either shock or not shock the

we just give them $2400 instead of the whole benefit of the bargain?<span

people dont do these acts unless they believe that the house is going to be
theirs forever.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you use the
evidentiary requirement, its a higher burden of proof because the acts cant
be ambiguous.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anytime you have these

we frustrate the parties intentions because we think its very important for

starts with real property, and the vendee starts with personal property
(money).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the contract is signed,

the contract tries to make a distinction between major and minor damage, using
the figure of 10% of the purchase price as a cutoff.<span

often in residential real estate transactions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>These <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were</i> used before the
Great Depression, when the idea of interest-only was more popular.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mortgages were much shorter in length.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But interest-only led to a lot of defaults,
and a kind of cascading effect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
could have a level payment that is some arbitrary amount.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could pay interest plus a certain amount
of principal each month, followed by a payment of the remainder of the
principal at the end of the loan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
is used with income-producing property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You pay the interest plus a given amount of the principal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You negotiate based on what the income of the
building is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The last and most common way
to pay off the loan is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fully
amortized</i> mortgage, meaning that once you establish a term and an interest
rate, you do a calculation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you make
a payment of a certain amount, then at the end of the term, the mortgage will
be paid in full: principal <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its a constant payment of the
same amount every month, and by the time you make the last payment, the loan is
fully repaid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The last payment will be
the same amount that the first one was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is the most common mortgage, especially for residential transactions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We went over the kinds of payment
arrangements you can have with a mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Theres one more: you dont have to amortize the mortgage over the term
of the mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can do smaller
payments but then pay off the rest of the total as a lump sum at the end of the
term: a balloon or bullet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
primarily done when you have seller financing due to the fact that interest
rates are high or the buyer doesnt have enough money for the down
payment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller will finance the
purchase price, but will only agree to finance for five years or so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>When you start out paying a
mortgage, youre paying mostly interest and little principal, but then it
gradually shifts over the term of the mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Each month, the interest is getting smaller because its calculated on
the outstanding principal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The interest
is calculated each month based on what you owe at the time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As you pay less interest, you take the
difference and put it into playing for principal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This makes up the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>amortization curve</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
slope of the curve is relatively flat at the top: you pay a lot of interest in
the first few years and not so much principal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But near the end, youre paying primarily principal rather than
interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You dont have a month where
you pay more principal than interest until you get a good ways towards the end
of the term.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does this say about
refinancing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People do it all the
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When interest rates go down,
people refinance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But when you
refinance, you move back to the beginning of the curve!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Remember that the interest is tax-deductible,
while the principal is not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you
refinance and dont take cash out and you keep your payment the same, then
youll end up better off: youll pay off the loan faster.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you take money out, youre even worse off:
its like you go further back than where you started!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There is a very strong policy
(that Braunstein doesnt understand) in favor of encouraging people to buy

people to own <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>something</i>, but why
houses in particular?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Historically, it
may make sense with World War II veterans needing a place to live.<span

the government subsidizes it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is <span
class=GramE>this such</span> a great place to invest money as a society?<span

a farmer who owns his own land is a better citizen for being an owner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But why is it so much better to own a house
than to save money or invest in stock?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This policy is reflected in how to make mortgage payments smaller.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>You can reduce your payments
by reducing the amount of principal you borrow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You could also try to get a lower interest rate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are many programs designed to reduce
interest rates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, the state
borrows a bunch of money at 3-4% and then <span class=SpellE>reloans</span> it
to home buyers for 4-5%.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The state makes
a little money and the homebuyer gets an interest rate lower than what they
would be able to get on their own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Another way to make the
interest rate lower is to have the Fed fiddle with the interest rate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The interest rate equals the true cost of
money (an absolutely safe investment, with no inflation, about 2-3%) plus the
inflation risk plus the cost of credit risk.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The federal government may intervene to reduce the risk of certain loans
by insuring them, shifting the credit risk from the mortgage lender to the
federal government.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that there have
been mortgage devices created to reduce inflation risk, like <span
class=SpellE>ARMs</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you can
adjust the rate of the mortgage every year based on an index, then you take
less of a risk with respect to inflation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Also, it doesnt seem to make sense to pay extra for a 30 year mortgage
when youre only going to live there for seven years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Also, the longer you have to
repay the loan, the less youll pay every month.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the total cost of the mortgage will
also be greater over the life of the loan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You could also change the amortization rate so that your monthly payment
is lower, but then you have the balloon/bullet coming at you at the end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

deed, the buyer records the deed, and thats it.<span

paying off an existing mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
seller delivers the deed, the buyer pays the money.<span

off the mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The buyer could get a
new loan and use it to pay cash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
buyer secures the loan with the deed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The buyer could also take over the sellers old loan instead of having
it paid off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the old loan was a good
deal, the buyer may want to keep it alive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>You could also have seller
financing, in whole or in part.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
buyer could pay a cash down payment plus a promissory note and mortgage for the
balance in exchange with the deed to the property (encumbered by the
outstanding mortgage).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In that
situation, the seller wears two hats.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The seller basically is the same person as the lender to the buyer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could combine seller financing and taking
over an existing mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the buyer
doesnt have enough money for the down payment, the buyer might take over the
existing mortgage and then have the seller finance the down payment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The buyer could give the seller an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>additional note </i>and a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>second mortgage</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Second mortgage refers to the priority with

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Finally, we have wrapping
around an existing mortgage loan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
terminology isnt really helpful.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
is really a combination of seller financing and keeping the existing mortgage
in effect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The difference is that the
new mortgage is for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>total amount
thats being lent</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The new, second
mortgage will represent the total purchase price minus whatever cash is
paid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The second mortgage is for the
full purchase price less the down payment instead of the difference between the
existing mortgage and the new mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The seller has the advantage of being in control, because the buyer
makes a payment that is sufficient to pay the old mortgage <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and</i> the new one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the
seller pays the old lender.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller <i

if a loan is about to go into default.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When the buyer does it, the seller may not find out about a default
until its too late to do anything about it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For a wraparound to be beneficial, you must be able to keep the old loan
in effect, and that loan must have a lower interest rate than current market
rates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both of those are highly
problematic in the current environment: wraparounds arent important right now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>How does the seller make
money on a wraparound?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller is
really loaning $110,000 and really getting paid $885 a month.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What the seller is doing is not loaning his <i

the money from the old lender at a higher interest rate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hes borrowing money from the old lender at a
lower interest rate and then <span class=SpellE>reloaning</span> it at a higher
rate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the old loan was at 7% and <span
class=SpellE>reloan</span> it at 9%, then youre making a lot of interest on
the new money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The return to the
lender is quite high!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the same time,
the interest rate paid by the borrower is below market rate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The borrower and seller do well, but the
original lender suffers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lenders will
object to this!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Theyll object to any
situation where the buyer takes the property encumbered by an existing loan
when rates have gone up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These were very
popular when it was harder for lenders to enforce due-on-sale clauses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, this kind of financing has become less
popular and valuable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

been breached.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court holds that
there was no constructive eviction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
coal company searched the title and found there was a reservation of two thirds
of the interest in the coal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
plaintiffs claim that this constitutes an eviction because the grantor didnt
tell them about this reservation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
the court holds that this isnt an eviction because the plaintiffs werent
denied possession of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subsurface</i>.<span

the fact that you turned out not to have good title: you must have more than

reserved two-thirds of the coal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
lose because the statute of limitations for bringing an action for breach of
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>present</i> covenant had started to
run on the date of the delivery of the deed, which was over ten years ago.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This seems like an odd position for the
plaintiffs to be in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They say its too
late to bring the action for breach of covenant of seisin, but its too early
for them to bring an action for quiet enjoyment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other reason to start mining the

to acquire the coal by adverse possession.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

grantor?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You wont get more than
rescission, and in fact youll get less.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You havent lost everything; youve only lost a portion.<span

case of this partial loss you would get the $50,000 back.<span

value of the coal relative to the value of the entire property that you
purchased.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lets say the true value of
the property is $150,000, so youve lost 50% of the value of the property.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thats your recovery: you get 50% of the
consideration paid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thats not a great
remedy for several reasons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Youre not
getting back your entire damages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Youre

loss, but it just doesnt know when.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

absolute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Inflation protection is

is that its a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>single-premium policy</i>.<span

payment for coverage basically forever.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If theres a mistake in the policy, that is, if there is some loss that
is covered by the policy, then the policy doesnt necessarily pay the full

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>How does a mortgagee get
possession?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a title theory state,
possession can be gained on demand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
an intermediate state, possession can be gained on demand <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>after default</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a lien
theory state, you can only get possession by a voluntary act of the mortgagor,
or when the mortgagor abandons the property, or when possession is authorized
by the mortgage itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>These theories of the
mortgage dont make much difference these days because we use the same sorts of
instruments all throughout the country, and they have the same provisions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These theories may be important in other
contexts, for example, in determining whether a mortgage severs a joint
tenancy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But mostly, well be thinking
about what the mortgage instrument provides rather than what these theories
would dictate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Lower inflation risk leads to
lower long-term interest rates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even
though the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates, more confidence is
created that there wont be inflation long-term.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Restatement of Mortgages § 4.1(a) sides with the lien theory states.</span></span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>§ 4.1(b) says
that generally mortgages cant grant an enforceable right to possession <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in the future</i> to the mortgagee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why do you need both?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You cant make an agreement at the time the
mortgage is being entered into that will give the mortgagee the right to
possession.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But later events can allow
that to happen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The balance of power
changes between the borrower and lender once the borrower has the money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the borrower needs the money, the law
presumes that they may agree to just about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anything</i>
in order to get their hands on the money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So the law tries to protect these people due to their perceived lack of
borrowing power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once the borrower has
the money and the lender wants to get it back, the borrower has the upper
hand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So you cant make an agreement
like this at the outset as part of the loan transaction, but if certain events
come up <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>later</i>, agreements with
respect to possession <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>will</i> be
enforced.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a concept well come
back to again and again: the premise is that borrowers lack bargaining power at
the outset, but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> once the
transaction is completed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unlikely to be made.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagee sues
to obtain possession.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whats the
result?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It doesnt matter if you

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nope.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You can only get the property sold and get the money.<span

could show up at the foreclosure sale and buy the property.<span

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is it advisable?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even if you have a right to possession as a
mortgagee, its probably not a very good idea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The mortgagee is delegated a very strict fiduciary duty of
accounting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Any rents or income you
collect that are above the amount owed must be credited to the amount
owed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You must act like a prudent owner,
which may well mean you have to dig into your own pocket to take care of the
property and make it productive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You may
also be liable to third parties in tort.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So this is a risky proposition, and there is a cleaner, easier route to
take: the receivership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally, the
mortgagee in possession will work just like a foreclosure as far as leases are
concerned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you want to go into
possession to intercept the rents, but going into possession <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>terminates</i> the leases, then its not
such a great idea to take possession.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Lenders prefer to have a receiver appointed by the court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But there are costs and risks in this case
too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The receivership may be expensive,
and youre not guaranteed a receiver who is competent.<span

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In commercial mortgages, the
lease obligations of tenants may be more important than the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>value</i> of the real estate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Take a shopping center, for example.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Easton and Northland both have buildings and
land and stuff, but Northland is not worth nearly as much as Easton because the
landlord gets paid by having a loan on productive property, that is, by having
enough rent coming in to pay the mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The lender goes into the transaction hoping to get repaid with
interest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the lender takes
possession, however, the leases get terminated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What about when a mortgage is
foreclosed?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It depends on the relative
priority of the mortgage and the lease.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The purchaser at foreclosure gets the title <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>as it existed immediately before the mortgage being foreclosed was
granted</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the lease was entered
into before a mortgage and that mortgage forecloses, then the tenant is still
bound under the lease.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if the lease
came after an earlier mortgage, then the foreclosure of the mortgage will <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>terminate the lease</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if the lease has priority, the tenant has
no right to terminate the lease, and neither does the purchaser at
foreclosure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tenant must <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>attorn</i></span> to the
foreclosure purchaser, meaning that the tenant must treat the purchaser just
the same as they treated the original landlord.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If the foreclosure is going
to terminate the lease, why does the lender care about the continuation of the
leases anyway?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If we represent lenders,
we can protect ourselves up to the moment of foreclosure by having a receiver
appointed instead of going into possession.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why does the lender care what happens after foreclosure?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The purchaser at foreclosure is going to pay
more for a productive property with lots of leases, which makes it more likely
the lender will get their debt paid back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>So if the lease has priority,
we know the legal result.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what if
the mortgage has priority? <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>If the tenant
is a party to the foreclosure, the tenants lease is terminated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means that even if the foreclosure
purchase wants to keep the tenant, the tenant can walk away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, the tenant cant force the purchaser at
foreclosure to accept the tenant since the lease is terminated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In some states, the mortgagee can
intentionally omit the tenant and keep the lease in effect, or in other words,
pick and choose.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you dont join a
party and they dont have notice, their rights cant be adversely affected.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lawsuit wont have an effect as to
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if the lender doesnt join the
tenants they want to keep, their leases will not be terminated.<span

it.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

something less, like 80%, which leaves a 20% cushion.<span

getting paid, meaning that the principal is reduced and the cushion gets bigger
over time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So you could argue that if
the value of the security is less than the lien, then security is
adequate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other way to argue it is
to say that if the ratio of the amount of the outstanding lien to the value of
the property is greater than originally expected, then the security is
inadequate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagee typically
expects that the principal will be paid down and the loan, in some sense, will
become more secure as time goes on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Restatement takes the view that you bargained for the cushion: not just the
original 20%, but the rest of the cushion built into the amortization of the
mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the mortgagee isnt where
they expected to be on the amortization curve, then we say that the security is

Mortgagee-1 makes a loan of $80,000 to Mortgagor, who executes a promissory note

Mortgagor, secured by a second mortgage on <span class=SpellE>Blackacre</span>.
During the ensuing five years, Mortgagor makes all scheduled amortization
payments on both loans, reducing the first loan balance to $70,000 and the
second loan balance to $5,000. <span class=SpellE>Blackacre's</span> value
remains at $100,000. Mortgagor then commits waste, reducing <span class=SpellE>Blackacre's</span>
value by $20,000 to $80,000. Since the scheduled loan-to-value ratio on the
first loan at the time of the waste was $70,000 divided by $100,000, or 70
percent, Mortgagee-1 is entitled to a restoration of that loan-to-value ratio.
The value of <span class=SpellE>Blackacre</span> now being reduced to $80,000,
Mortgagee-1's damages recovery should reduce the debt balance to 70 percent of
$80,000, or $56,000. Mortgagee-1 may recover (and upon recovery must credit

value available to Mortgagee-2 has been reduced to $80,000 minus the balance

waste before Mortgagee-2's action for waste must be decided, the balance owing

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We'll spend a fair amount of
time in this class on cases involving residential real estate. We'll do this not because it's the main focus
of this course: lawyers aren't even involved in it much anymore. But we'll emphasize it because the rules are
about the same as commercial real estate. There are now some consumer protection rules in residential real
estate. The rules don't apply as harshly
with commercial real estate. The law
assumes in that case that the parties have roughly equal bargaining power and
can take care of themselves. Residential
real estate transactions are easy to understand, so it's easier to teach and
learn the rules in that context rather than deal with a commercial transaction
where we have to spend a lot of time on the facts.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>NPR said the other day that
it is expected that there will be one foreclosure for every 117 mortgages
outstanding in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>. Braunstein
finds that difficult to believe! That
would mean that over time, everyone will get kicked out of their homes! So that's a big number. Some of the devices that the federal
government uses to make housing more affordable have actually had the opposite
effect. Take <span class=SpellE>ARMs</span>
for example: as interest rates start to go up and adjustable rates rise, people
can't make the payments and go into foreclosure. We're going to go to a foreclosure
auction. When we do foreclosure, we'll
learn the rules, but also ask whether the rules make sense. They're designed to protect the borrower, but
are the rules effective?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The law of real property and
the law of real estate finance, which is a subset, used to be almost <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entirely</i> local, meaning peculiar to the
state where the property is located and in many cases, peculiar to certain
parts of the state. There used to be
different practices in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Cleveland</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> than in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Columbus</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> or </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Cincinnati</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>. But an </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> lawyer certainly would not think of representing
someone buying real estate in another state. Even today, you'll generally hire local counsel to assist you. But the practice of this area of law has
really become much more <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>national</i> in
the last 30-40 years for a number of reasons.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Why was it the way it
was? Lawyers are typically licensed
locally. You're admitted to practice in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> or maybe two states. As far as lawyers are involved, it must be a local practice. The same thing was traditionally true for
banks and savings &amp; loans. They were
licensed locally and they only loaned in the area in which they did
business. There were local lenders under
local law, and that worked to insulate the law of one state from another. But things have changed!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The lawyer, especially in a
residential transaction, has become less and less important, at least when it
comes to the buyer and seller. The
lender and title insurance company are represented by counsel, but not the
buyer and seller. So the locality makes
less of a difference. Also, banks now
operate nationally. Depression-era bank
restrictions and regulations have been relaxed, and you see more and more <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>national</i> lenders. National lenders want <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>standardization</i>. Every
lender wants to standardize the process as much as possible to reduce
transactions costs. When you don't need
separate processes and forms for different states, it doesn't cost as much.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Another change is the rise of
title insurance. After World War II,
there was a big population increase and federal policies designed to encourage
people to buy single-family homes. There
was a lot of development, especially out West, that was not near established
financial institutions. The major </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Chicago</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> banks couldn't loan money to build houses in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>. Insurance companies
stepped up to the plate! They're
national lenders. They have lots of
money to invest and could invest nationally. The insurance companies thought: how do we know title opinions are any
good? What if an attorney makes a
mistake? Will the attorney be able to
pay the damages suffered due to a bad title opinion? Lending insurance companies like Prudential
and Equitable decided not to rely on local lawyers, but instead buy insurance
themselves. Once you take a lawyer out
of giving an opinion on title, they have less of a role in transactions.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The Federal Housing
Authority, Fannie Mae, Farmer's Home Loan Board and so on are
federally-chartered organizations. They
act as a private corporation but are infused with public interest and public
policy. Their debts are backed by the
federal government. The FHA wants to
help finance this real estate development that's going on, particularly
residential real estate development after the war. They make a deal where they agree to buy
mortgages. If you borrow some money in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> and that bank runs out of money to lend, then that's
okay, but the next person who wants to buy a house won't be able to. So the FHA buys the mortgages. Whoever the home purchaser was will owe the
FHA the money, and the FHA will give the money back to the bank. The FHA has a big demand, just like the
insurance companies, for uniformity. When the FHA is buying mortgages, they want every single one to be the
same so they don't have to read each one. They want to know if it's a certain type of FHA-approved mortgage, and
then they'll know that it's acceptable. Banks insist on these because even if they don't decide to sell the
mortgage to the FHA or Fannie Mae, they might, and they insist that virtually
all mortgages be on the FHA form. So
even though the FHA doesn't have the authority to prescribe what a mortgage
says, in practice, they have a lot of power.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>All of these forces are
working to make the law of real property, at least in the context in which
we're studying it, more and more homogeneous throughout the country. Take for example the Restatement of
Mortgages. Now we can study cases from
all different jurisdictions to determine what the law is. We won't just look at </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> cases, whereas 20 or 30 years ago that's almost all
we looked at. We will also spend time on
the most important forms, as found in the back of the book. We'll ask how various cases would have been
decided under an FHA mortgage, for example.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The exam will be similar to

<p><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Outline of the typical transaction</span></b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The typical transaction
involves a contract. Even simple real
estate transactions are more complex generally than transactions involving
personal property. This is partly the result
of tradition and partly the nature of the transaction itself that makes it more
difficult. The typical deal starts, from
the buyer's perspective, with finding a property, with or without the aid of a
real estate agent or broker. In the
overwhelming majority of cases, the seller has already contracted with a real
estate broker. The seller will have
entered into a listing agreement that authorizes the broker to put up signs,
etc. and hopefully bring buyers forward.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>An aside: </span></i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>A
real estate agent is a lesser qualification than a real estate broker. An agent takes an exam and is licensed by the
state to engage in that practice. You
don't need any experience. But you have
to do business with a real estate broker, who needs to have been practicing for
a certain amount of time and have passed a certain more difficult exam. So a real estate agent cannot practice on his
or her own. In terms of what we're
studying, there is no difference between the agent and the broker and so we'll
use the terms synonymously for the most part. Note how this is different than the meaning of broker that you'll find
in BA.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Next, the parties come
together and decide that they've agreed on the property and terms, and thus a
contract must be prepared. In
residential transactions, the contract is almost always printed on a standard
form that is published jointly by the Bar Association and the Board of
Realtors. Braunstein says it's not a bad
contract. The idea is that there's not
enough money involved in residential transactions to draw up a contract from
scratch every time. It doesn't justify
having a lawyer involved because the transactions are pretty routine. The parties can usually customize just a few
clauses themselves. In commercial
transactions, however, form contracts are rarely used, even for relatively
simple transactions. Big transactions
begin to justify the attorneys' fees involved and negotiations that bring the
two sides together in their understanding of their agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Why do you need a contract of
sale? There are two things going
on. Banks don't want to get involved in
a transaction until they know what the transaction is. They don't want to process a loan until the
property and terms are already determined (though this has changed in the last
10 years with prequalification). Also,
the buyer won't want to commit to purchase until financing is secured. The buyer doesn't want to unconditionally
promise hundreds of thousands of dollars that the buyer doesn't have. The seller has an incentive to have a
contract as well, even if it's somewhat contingent. The seller is going to essentially take the
property off the market, and they want to make sure that the buyer is obligated
to secure financing and do their best to close the transaction.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The other thing that
distinguishes the transaction in the purchase of real as opposed to personal
property is the question of title. We
separate ownership from possession in the law of real property. Someone who is in possession of land may not
own it or may not own the whole "bundle of sticks". You must investigate title, which takes time
and costs money. Buyers don't want to
take the time to investigate title and then find that the property is off the
market. Title insurance works by telling
the title insurer what property you want. They do a title search and then issue a title commitment, saying that if
you buy the property they will insure title on the property.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Finally, we come to
closing. Closing describes two different
things: it describes, at least in some cases, a kind of conference that takes
place with the buyer, real estate agent and <span class=GramE>title company</span>
and frequently a bank representative. You meet for the purpose of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fully
executing </i>the transaction. When we
say a transaction is to close on a certain date, we mean that all of the
obligations of the contract are to be performed on that date. <span class=GramE>The obligations of the
contract boil down to the buyer paying the money and the seller delivering the
deed.</span> At that point the contract
becomes executed and is no longer executory. The deed is then transferred. <span
class=GramE>Then documents have to be recorded, particularly the deed and the
mortgage.</span> Lawyers may handle
this, but more frequently the title company takes care of it. Closing memoranda and "bibles" are
prepared. And that's itunless there's litigation.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Role of the lawyer</span></b><span style='font-size:
11.0pt'></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Lawyers don't play much of a
role in residential real estate transactions anymore because they've been
driven out by title insurance. The most
complex thing that the lawyer did was give an opinion of title. Now that's done by title insurance
companies. The reason for this is that
has the real estate market has become more national, the demand for uniformity
in documentation has become more important. Title insurance is on a standard form published by one or two different
land title organizations. Because they
are regulated insurance companies, title insurance companies must have a
certain amount of assets to back their liabilities.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>It is sometimes asserted that
title insurance is cheaper than a lawyer's title opinion, but Braunstein thinks
that's not necessarily clear. Title
insurance starts at $5 per $1,000 of value. As the purchase price goes up, the insurance premium goes down somewhat. In </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Chicago</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, by contrast, title insurance is more like $1 per
$1000. Most of the difference goes as a
commission to the title insurance agent, not to the person who is actually
insuring it. The way lawyers did it was
that the lawyer would search the title and come up with an opinion. The lawyer would take all the documents that he
or she had looked at and put them in a binder: this would be the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>abstract of title</i>. This would either be given to the lender if
there was a mortgage, or if there was no mortgage (or when it was paid off) it
would be held by the purchaser. The next
time there was a sale, the abstract would be given to the next lawyer, who
would update it to the date of the new sale. This would continue as the property was sold, and the abstract got to be
quite thick. As long as you don't lose
the abstract, the process was actually quite simple and inexpensive. Once you don't need a lawyer to explain the
hard stuff, the routine parts of the transaction drop away. So lawyers are, for the most part, out of the
residential real estate business.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Residential real estate transactions
almost always go off without a hitch. A
lawyer might say that someone is taking a risk in buying or selling without
legal advice, but the transactions very seldom result in litigation. In </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Franklin</span></st1:PlaceName><span
 style='font-size:11.0pt'> </span><st1:PlaceName><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>County</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, there are, on average, about 2,000 real estate
transactions a month. In absolute terms,
there's a lot of litigation, but it's a very small percentage of the
transactions. Braunstein isn't sure that
lawyers add much to the cost. Does the
title insurer perform the function that the lawyer used to? Not really. If you go and buy life insurance, the life insurance company doesn't
tell you to live a healthy life. They
just say: give me the money, and here's your policy. That's the way title insurance companies
work. There is no "advice" function. The title insurance companies write the
policy, which often means a lot less than the insured thinks, and the title
agent typically doesn't explain it. If
there's a tough question, the title agent will probably advise getting a
lawyer.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Who does the real estate
broker represent? The broker typically
represents the seller. The broker isn't
in a situation to advise the buyer, for example, "you shouldn't buy this
property because there's a potential title defect!" It's hard for the broker to give independent
advice to the buyer. The broker
represents the seller and it would be violating a duty to the seller to advise
the buyer. Also, the buyer's livelihood
is contingent on closing the sale. So
this is an unlikely source of independent advice for the buyer.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Buyers frequently say that
they don't need advice because the "real money" is coming not from the buyer
but a lender who is putting up as much as 100% of the purchase price. So if the title and appraisal are good enough
for the lender, why aren't they good enough for the buyer? The bank looks at the collateral, but they
also look at the borrower. Banks look at
the transaction differently from borrowers. They know that a certain percentage of their loans will default and
they'll lose that money. But this is
built into the interest rate. The bank
can spread the risk over a whole bunch of people and a whole bunch of
loans. The individual buying the house
is not able to do that so easily.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are some things that
the bank might not care about that might be important to you, such as aspects
that don't affect the value of the real estate. Maybe you'd like to build a swimming pool but there is a restrictive
covenant against building a pool. That
wouldn't affect the value of the property to the bank, but it would affect its
value to you. The bank has no economic
stake in whether you can use the property in the way you planned. In most transactions, the bank has a "cushion". The buyer makes a down payment in most
transactions. Even if there is a defect,
the bank only cares whether the value of the collateral will be affected. If the value is cut by 5% but the bank has,
for example, a 20% cushion from the down payment, then they won't care. The risk of a bad title or undisclosed defect
with respect to title turns out to be quite small, even though titles can be
very complex.</span></p>

     </span>They get paid, for example, even if the property gets sold to a

     help of an agent, then there is no commission due.</span></li>
 <li  style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><span
     style='font-size:11.0pt'>Open listing  this is a listing where you tell

     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We won't get into the meaning of that

     style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have an exclusive listing, you
     don't have to do anything because you can simply hope another agent comes

     forward as the procuring cause of the sale.</span></li>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What type of listing appears
in the book on page three? It's an
"exclusive sale and listing agreement"! <span
class=GramE>Says so right in the title.</span> But they also refer to the exclusive right to submit offers. They have the exclusive right to "receipt for
deposit". What does that mean? If someone gives the agent a check along with
an offer, they'll give a receipt for it and they can deposit the check in their
checking account, earning interest. So
we have an exclusive listing. The agent
gets a commission if it's sold to anybody. What are the duties of the agent? They have to make efforts to sell the property and list it with the
Multiple Listing Service. What does that
mean? It's very vague. Do they have to make their <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>best effort</i>? <span class=GramE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Reasonable</i> efforts?</span> Do they have to try more than once? If you were going to negotiate this contract, you might negotiate what
efforts will be necessary. This is
pretty much the only duty the agent has! The fact is that most agents will do what they told you they would do,
but it's good to have it in writing.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What about the owner? What are the owner's duties? The owner must cooperate. What is the biggest pitfall? What happens if the owner doesn't provide
good title? The owner still owes a
commission! That's a dangerous situation
to be in, because most people don't understand what their title is! In addition, most people don't have the cash
to pay the commission unless a sale goes through.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are lots of ways under
the listing agreement in the book. The
agent gets a conclusive presumption that he or she caused the sale! Does there have to be a sale in order to have
a selling price? How could there be a
selling price if the seller removes the property from the market? But there is a selling price listed on the
contract. How do we feel about the rules
for when the agent earns the commission? If you're representing the seller, you'll want to change the paragraph
about the commission in a number of ways. If you wanted to make it clear that the agent only received the
commission in the event that the sale closed, what would you say? What about the doctrine of preventing
performance? If the agent brings in a
good offer but you screw it up in some way, they've probably earned their
commission. Is it enough to say that the
commission is due "at the closing" or "when the sale closes"? What if the buyer defaults? Do we protect ourselves by saying that the
commission is payable when the sale closes? Wouldn't the court just imply a reasonable time? If the condition that was agreed upon never
occurs, then the court will say that the commission is at a reasonable
time. Thus, you've only really agreed on
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>when</i> the commission gets paid, not <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i> it gets paid.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are other elements you
might want to change. The <span
class=GramE>agent want</span> to be protected from being cut out of the deal by
the buyer and seller waiting until the listing expires. So they put language in saying that if you
sell the property to anybody who they introduced you to, even after the six
months is up, they still get the commission. You would want to make the agent notify the seller in writing of
everyone that they think they had introduced you to. Also, it can be negotiated so that it only
applies if there isn't another agent involved. The rationale is that you shouldn't have to pay twice.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>Drake v. <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span></span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>  There are more than two people who want to buy
property in North Pole, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  11.0pt'>Alaska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>! So first, Drake signs an exclusive listing
agreement with <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span>. A purchase agreement is signed such that they
are to close within 10 days of getting evidence of clear title. The thing is that Drake owes some money to
his ex-wife. How will that be
handled? Well, he was going to pay off
his ex-wife as soon as the property is sold. Good title is considered at the time of closing. Sometimes you can get good title by using the
proceeds of the sale to pay off any liens on the property. So they get evidence of clear title. Then Drake's attorney and <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span>
apparently agree to expedite the closing. There's no closing on April 11<sup>th</sup>, and then on April 12<sup>th</sup>,
Drake sells to another person. Did Drake
really find a buyer between April 11<sup>th</sup> and April 12<sup>th</sup>? No way! Someone probably came and told him they would pay more if he could
weasel his way out of the contract. On
April 12<sup>th</sup>, <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span> tenders performance.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The simplest way to buy
property is to pay cash out-of-pocket. One alternative is to borrow the money from the bank in exchange for the
mortgage. To the seller, it's all the
same because they get cash. But it might
be hard to find a bank in North Pole, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Alaska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>! Or maybe you
have bad credit. Maybe the seller will
say: "Okay, I'm the bank!" The buyer
buys a down payment and then agrees to pay the seller in installments. At the end of the day, as far as the buyer is
considered, it's pretty much the same. But the seller has some cash plus a promissory note secured by the
mortgage to pay the balance.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Hosley</span></span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> sues for his commission. Does he get it? Yes! What's the rule of the case? The
commission is earned when the seller accepts the buyer: the seller is then <span
class=SpellE>estopped</span> from saying that the buyer isn't suitable. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>At that point, the seller becomes obligated to
pay the commission. What's wrong with
that rule? What is the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs</i> rule? The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs</i>
rule requires <span class=GramE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>performance</i>,
that</span> is, closing the sale in order for the commission to be earned. What's the public policy here? The court says that people commonly
understand that you don't pay unless the sale closes. So they make a new rule there for </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>New Jersey</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What if you want to do
business differently? What if the broker
wants the commission as soon as a buyer is found and accepted by the
seller? That seems to be the problem
with the rule. Some say that we want
people to be able to contract any way they want. But that's not the sentiment of the consumer
protection movement. Should we have
freedom of contract, or should consumers be protected from themselves? Other courts who have adopted the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs</i> rule have said that you can waive
it, but it's kind of like a UCC requirement: you have to give lots of notice to
the seller to assure that they know what they're getting themselves into.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What happens here? Does it matter what rule the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Alaska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> court adopted? It doesn't because performance was still tendered. Thus, the court argues, the buyer attempted
to perform and thus, according to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs</i>,
the seller defaulted. We assume that the
result is that Drake must pay two commissions: one to <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span>
and one to the agent who secured the eventual sale. Did Drake deserve this?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What was the deal about who <span
class=SpellE>Hosley</span> represents? Why did the court care? The court
says that Drake's attorney and <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span> can't agree to
anything because they both represent Drake. Whatever <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span> said, it doesn't make a
difference because the agreement wasn't between the buyer and the seller. This is how the court upholds summary
judgment. Does this make sense? Maybe <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span> talked
to the sellers. You can at least imagine
that he did. We don't get a trial to
find out. Maybe <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span>
mediated an agreement. But as a matter
of law, the court finds that <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span> is not an agent
of the purchasers and can't bind them.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>But the court could have
dealt with this differently. The
contract doesn't say that time is of the essence. They could have said that closing on the 12<sup>th</sup>
or the 13<sup>th</sup> is okay. They
could have said Drake is a creep who shouldn't be able to weasel his way out of
paying the commission. But they say that
Drake's attorney, <span class=SpellE>Wickwire</span>, and <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span>
both owe their allegiance to Drake. Even
if the court adopts <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs</i>, <span
class=SpellE>Hosley</span> still gets his commission. Most states use the old rule. A minority have adopted <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

the sale must be voluntary? Nope. We don't intuitively like the idea of the
seller having to pay a commission when there is an involuntary sale, but that's
what the contract provides for. Many

security device <span class=GramE>like a mortgages</span>. We'll put it off until after we've already
covered mortgages. With the marketing
contract, the parties contemplate that they'll sign the agreement, which is
highly conditional (like the one in the text), and then as soon as the
contingencies are satisfied, there will be a closing, consideration will be
paid in full, and the deed will be transferred. So the contract won't have a long life before being fully executed. The contract for deed essentially says that
the contract will remain in effect for a certain period of years, which may be
a long time. The legal title to the
property will be in the vendor until the vendee pays the consideration in
full. The vendee will pay a certain
amount of money per month. If all
payments are made, then the vendee keeps the property. If the payments aren't made, the vendee gets

main force for getting this included is protection for the agent. This clause requires the seller to disclose
everything and submit to the buyer the seller's disclosure form. Real estate agents are in a legally untenable
position: they represent the seller, and their loyalty is to the seller, but
they also have a duty to disclosure material defects to the buyer. That creates big time conflicts of
interest! What's happened is that the
standard form contract is used to attempt to shift the liability for failure to

the note or memorandum in order to make it enforceable. But what are these terms? How specific were they here? <span class=GramE>"80 acres land in the
rear"not very specific.</span> They
also have a legal description. But there
are lots of Section 31s, lots of Township 27s and Ranges 28, all over the
country! But we can combine this with
information from the taxing authority. Once we know it's in a county or municipality, then we know where the
land is.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This description would be
inadequate for a deed because it doesn't describe <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>one and only one</i> parcel of land. When we're putting something into public records, we need a greater
degree of certainty than when we have an agreement between two people. Some courts, however, would say that the
requirement is the same. But this court
doesn't adopt that standard. This court
takes a looser standard and says that the property only need be identified with
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i> certainty. There must also be an indication of how much
money was to be paid. It's not hard to
determine the price. So it's not
specified precisely, but it's easy enough to compute. There must be a promise, subject matter,
consideration, and price. What's the
difference between the consideration, price, and promise? What else is left for consideration once
price and promise are taken into account? Braunstein thinks you need the price, and the essential promise which is
to turn over the deed when the full payment has been made.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Was there really a contract
for the sale of land here? Why wasn't it
a lease? Well, it has this percentage
rate. It seems clear that there is a
contract here and we know with some certainty what the terms of the agreement
are. There doesn't seem to be much
reason not to enforce it. What's the
internal coherence requirement? How many
documents are relied on here to prove the contract? The vendor kept copies of all the checks and
a sort of "matrix" of records of payments. The court puts all the writings together and say that all of them taken
together constitute the note or memorandum required by the statute of frauds. The court doesn't tell us much about internal
coherence. Normally, it's required that
there is some reference in the writings that they deal with the same subject
matter. That's clear here in that many
of the documents are copies of each other.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The executor claims that the
price is inadequate. Is that a statute
of frauds claim? Keep in mind that when
you win on the statute of frauds, all you've done is establish that there was
an oral agreement that the court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i>
legally enforce. You haven't proved your
case, because this is a suit for specific performance. You must prove all the elements that are
required for enforcement of the contract. So the defendant tries to claim that the contract is inequitable. But the court says: this is an affirmative
defense, and the defendant didn't introduce any evidence about it. Inadequacy will be a successful affirmative
defense if the price is shockingly inadequate. But there was no evidence that would either shock or not shock the
court. If the price isn't inadequate,
you must show some other way that the contract was inequitable.</span></p>

of frauds? It's clear that a sale is
intended. We know that the promise is
for a sale. The memorandum must be
signed by the party to be charged. Is
"Love Barb" a signature? What's a
signature? Is it a mark that is intended
to give legal significance to the document? That seems to be the case here, but the letter seems pretty informal. It looks kind of like a preliminary
negotiation. But Diane and Jim call up
and want to buy the property. If <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>they</i> back out, then Barb is stuck
because there is no memorandum signed by them.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What if there was an exchange
of e-mails? What if this same note had
been e-mailed to Diane and Jim and they had responded with "OK"? Would that be enough to have a writing that
satisfies the statute of frauds? Can you
electronically sign over the telephone? Under the Electronic Records Act, the mark is defined in that it can be
an electronic signal instead of a pencil or pen mark. But there also still needs to be intent: was
this mark <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intended</i> to be a signature?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Does the statute of frauds
require a contract to be in writing? No! <span class=GramE>Just a note
or memorandum of the writing, and maybe not even that in the case of part
performance.</span> Does the statute of
frauds require the seller to sign the writing? Not in most states. Only the
"party to be charged" needs to sign. You
don't know who has to sign the memorandum until you know who's enforcing
it. If one party can enforce the
contract, the other one can't necessarily enforce it too. It's perfectly conceivable that only one
person will have signed the agreement, or note or memorandum of the
agreement. That's a very exceptional
circumstance in the law. Usually, if one
person can enforce against the other, then there is mutuality of remedy and the
other person can enforce too. But only
one side in this case can prove the contract exists!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Must the writing be introduced
into evidence in any action to enforce the contract? Not necessarily. The memorandum might have been
destroyed. You could just introduce
evidence that there once existed such a note or memorandum. You'd need a pretty darn good explanation,
but just because you don't still have the writing doesn't mean you have a legal
difficulty with the statute of frauds; you just have an evidentiary difficulty.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Note that the statute of
frauds is an affirmative defense. The
statute of frauds doesn't require a single writing. What about a judicial agreement? If the purpose of the statute of frauds is
evidentiary, then if you admit there was a contract there's probably sufficient
evidence that the contract existed. That
ought to be enough. But what's wrong
with that? It encourages perjury! Instead of saying that we had an agreement
but it's not in writing, you simply lie! The states split on this. There
are at least some states where a judicial admission would not be enough and
could not be used to satisfy the statute of frauds for that reason.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If the statute of frauds is
not satisfied, it doesn't necessarily mean that there is no contract. The purchaser can still get rescission and
restitution. You could argue, however,
that this is based on an idea of unjust enrichment. But then there is also the part performance
doctrine. Even if you have the statute
of frauds, there are lots of exceptions, such as easements by implication or necessity
that don't have to be in writing but are enforceable.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are three acts of part

taking possession, and (3) making substantial improvements on the land. Which of these <span class=GramE>are actually
performance</span>? Is partial payment
of the purchase price performance of the contract? It depends on when the payment is due under
the contract. It sounds like, usually,
that would be performance of the contract. But not taking possession: you can own land and never even see it. And not making improvements, for the same
reason. Why should the vendor care if
you make improvements to a house that they're selling to you? <span class=GramE>So the last two aren't
typically performance of the agreement.</span> So it might be a good doctrine, but the name is confusing.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>  The mother and daughter get into a fight! The court finds that there was part
performance. What was the part
performance? The daughter paid part of
the purchase price, made some repairs, and took possession. There are lots of things that would establish
the part performance doctrine. We have
all three of the things we just mentioned! The court will enforce the agreement and the parents lose their house! The theory for the part performance exception
is to protect reliance and prevent unjust enrichment. Does this make much sense? In practice, we've gone much further than
protecting the reliance interest. But
here, they invested $2400 and got the whole house, which gives them a lot more
than their reliance interest. Why don't
we just give them $2400 instead of the whole benefit of the bargain? The second rationale the court uses is that
people don't do these acts unless they believe that the house is going to be
theirs forever. If you use the
evidentiary requirement, it's a higher burden of proof because the acts can't
be ambiguous. Anytime you have these
acts, there will be a question as to whether there is a temporary right of
possession as opposed to a sale.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We left off talking about
part performance. We mentioned the three
traditional elements listed as part performance. But only the first one is really <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>performance</i>. The part performance in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Roundy v. <span class=SpellE>Waner</span></i> was that the <span
class=SpellE>Waners</span> had made improvements to the property, made some
payments, and perhaps taken possession. Did the <span class=SpellE>Roundys</span> ever really intend to sell the
property? Why do we give specific
performance? That's kind of an anomaly,
at least if the intent is to prevent unjust enrichment. Also, did Mr. Roundy agree to any of this
stuff? It seems like only Mrs. Roundy
was in on it. How does the husband lose <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>his</i> interest in the house, unless Mrs.
Roundy is his agent?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Braunstein has two problems
with this case: (1) where you have a family or neighbor relationship, it may
seem inappropriate to demand <span class=GramE>a writing</span> in the way you
would in a commercial transaction. That
may justify some exceptions to the statute of frauds in those kinds of
transactions, although that's not what the court talks about. (2) The judges seem confident that there was
a contract made, but was there one really? Did the parties contemplate the consequences of a contract? Wherever you have an exception to the statute
of frauds based on acts, you must remember that acts are inherently
ambiguous. You never really know exactly
why people do what they do.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Can a vendor use the part
performance doctrine to enforce an oral contract against a purchaser? The <span class=SpellE>Waners</span> paid
some money and made some improvements. Is that enough to set up an estoppel against them? If they're willing to walk away from the
deal, is there any sense in which they've been unjustly enriched? Not really. There's no basis for equitably <span class=SpellE>estopping</span> the <span
class=SpellE>Waners</span> from denying the contract. If they want to deny it, you can argue that
they should be able to. Could you prove
acts of reliance on behalf of the vendor? In this particular case, it looks like it only goes one way. What if you use the evidentiary theory of
part performance? Wouldn't you have to
say yes? Aren't the <span class=SpellE>Waners</span>'
acts pretty good evidence that there was a contract? Isn't it evidence that's as good as <span
class=GramE>a writing</span>? So it
depends on which theory you hang your hat on. We ask: "Do we have evidence that's as good as <span class=GramE>a
writing</span>?" If the answer is yes,
we enforce the contract.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are also other acts
that could potentially constitute part performance, but they're just not
mentioned as often. Lots of acts could
satisfy either the evidentiary or unjust enrichment rationale that would lead
you to conclude that there's a contract. Braunstein is persuaded by these three acts because in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, they didn't like deeds, partly because many of them
couldn't read, but also because they liked livery of seisin. These part performance factors are similar to
livery of seisin in many ways. Historians have argued that the statute of frauds, even at the time it
was passed, contemplated these kinds of exceptions. These exceptions appear in the cases almost
as soon as the statute of frauds was passed.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In the end, Braunstein thinks
we should get rid of the statute of frauds. When we enforce it, we're frustrating the intention of the parties. We if say there was a contract but it's not
enforceable because it doesn't meet the formal requirement of a writing, then
we frustrate the parties' intentions because we think it's very important for
the parties to put their agreement in writing. Braunstein thinks that there are enough reasons to put agreements in
writing such that we won't cause any contracts that were previously written to
be oral. It's debatable whether the
statute of frauds adds anything; but we <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>know</i>
it subtracts. If you're going to have
the statute of frauds, why have the part performance exception at all,
then? If you're going to have it, why
not just say "we have the statute of frauds and will enforce it"? The law is of two minds on the statute of
frauds.</span></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc89826690"><b

remedies</span></b></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc89826690'></span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Buyer's remedies and seller's
remedies are basically mirror images of each other. That seems logical: in the event of a breach
they should have essentially the same remedies. The buyer's first remedy is specific performance, which means requiring
the parties to do whatever they agreed to do. The essential requirement for specific performance is that the buyer
cannot be in breach of the contract. As
long as the buyer has performed all the buyer's obligations under the contract
and as long as the seller is capable of conveying the property under the
contract, specific performance will be awarded. But what if the seller has sold to someone else who is a good faith
purchaser for value without notice? At
that point, the seller no longer owns the property and can't convey it. The person who owes the seller isn't obligated
to convey it. If the seller says: "I
promise to sell you my 100-acre farm", and it turns out that the farm is only
47 acres, then there's no specific performance (except specific performance
with abatement, about which more later) because they can't legally convey what
they promised to.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The next remedy is damages:
the benefit of the bargain. That means,
for the buyer, the market price (on the date the closing should have occurred)
minus the contract price. That usually
won't yield much money because fair market value is just what a willing buyer
and seller will agree to when reasonably well informed and not under
compulsion. Compensatory damages are
unlikely to lead to a large recovery except in exception circumstances. When we're talking about marketing contracts,
it's unlikely that there will be a big fluctuation in the value of the property
during the short life of the contract. These damages are also difficult to ascertain. The market price and date of breach will
require expert testimony because you must bring in an appraiser to say that the
buyer had a really good deal. Opinion
testimony is less reliable than evidence from an actual market transaction.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Next up, we have unilateral
rescission with restitution. This isn't <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mutual</i> rescission. Instead, the breach gives the buyer the
choice to declare the contract at an end. The buyer would be entitled to recover whatever earnest money deposit
had been made, with interest, and out-of-pocket costs specifically related to
the transaction. But the damages are
always limited by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hadley v. Baxendale</i>. But costs reasonably within the contemplation
of the parties and that are site-specific should be recoverable as a result of
rescission.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The hardest and least
important remedy is foreclosure of the vendee's lien. This exists only in some states. The vendee has parted with money. In the meantime, the vendor not only
breaches, but goes bankrupt. How does
the vendee get the money back from the vendor? The vendee's lien is a way to get the deposit back by having the
property sold. The only time this has
any relevance is when you have bankruptcy or insolvency. Otherwise, you just get a judgment against
the vendor and go through the usual process to have the judgment enforced.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p  style='mso-outline-level:3'><a name="_Toc89826691"><b

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Sellers are traditionally
also entitled to specific performance under certain circumstances. For the buyer, money damages are exactly the
opposite. We assume a rising market and
subtract the contract price minus the market price. The seller can also unilaterally rescind and
retain the deposit. When we talk about
these remedies as being comparable, is it really true that this is similar to
the rescission right that the buyer has? Who ends up better off as a result of rescission? What does the buyer get? They only get back their own earnest
money. But if the seller rescinds, the
seller gets the buyer's earnest money! The seller's right of rescission is actually much better than the buyer's
right.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What if the deposit is
greater than actual damages or there are no damages? What if the <span class=GramE>value of the
property has increased, but for some reason</span> the buyer has decided not to
go through with the deal anyway? Does
the seller still get to keep the deposit? It wouldn't seem fair for them to, but they get to keep the deposit
anyway. This does strike Braunstein as
unfair. He would try to write the
contract to change the remedies if possible to put the buyer and seller on an
equal footing. He also thinks that the
seller shouldn't get to keep the buyer's deposit if the seller wasn't
injured. The only potential benefit is
that you don't have to go through a whole trial if the seller just wants to
keep the deposit. That doesn't
necessarily mean that if you're a buyer with a small deposit that you can walk
away from the deal for cheap: you must check your contract.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The seller also has a vendor
lien. This may have no practical
importance, though it has some theoretical importance, especially when it comes
to equitable conversion. When you enter
a deal, the seller has legal <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
equitable title. But once you enter into
a contract, the buyer has equitable title and the seller has only "bare" legal
title. When the buyer breaches, you have
a situation where the equitable title is still in the buyer and there needs to
be some way to reclaim it and get it back to the seller. The foreclosure of the vendor's lien is the
way that it's done. Braunstein doesn't
know of any circumstance where this would actually come up.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Donovan v. <span class=SpellE>Bachstadt</span> </span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> What is the measure of damages when the vendor is
unable to convey because his title is not marketable? Was this an intentional or unintentional
breach of contract? Braunstein says that
it's irrelevant. The English rule,
followed by about half of American jurisdictions, is that even though you're
entitled to benefit of the bargain damages generally, you're not entitled to
such damages in this one area. How
come? How do we justify this? You might have a bad title for reasons you
don't appreciate. Maybe you gave someone
an easement, servitude, or real covenant that rendered your title unmarketable,
but you didn't really understand that this was happening. The idea is that if people don't get it, you
shouldn't punish them for it.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>But in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, you get benefit of the bargain damages in this
situation, just like all others. What's
the rationale for this? The idea is that
title searches are a lot easier now than they were in the past. But it's still inefficient to have two of
them done rather than one. The recovery
on warranties is restitution: you don't get benefit of the bargain
damages. One advantage of the English
rule is that it treats the pre-deed and post-deed situations the same way. The problem with warranties of title is that
they last a very long time. The contract
will last a short period of time and damages are knowable. The odds of an astronomical change in
property value are very slight. Warranties of title are considered real covenants and pass from one
purchaser to the next. If these
warranties allowed benefit of the bargain damages, the liabilities would become
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>entirely</i> unknowable. The American rule seems preferable. The difference is nominal damages versus
benefit of the bargain damages.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The court points out that
this is a default rule only, meaning that the parties can contract around
it. There's no public policy here; it's
just a matter of how the court will interpret the agreement if the parties
don't specific otherwise. Who has the
burden of brining up the issue in negotiations? The court says that the seller has this burden if the seller wants to be
protected in the event that he doesn't have marketable title. Since the seller knows best about his own
title, you can make a strong argument that this is where the burden ought to
be.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What about compensatory
damages for the vendee? It's usually the
difference between the market price and contract price on the date of
breach. With respect to the buyer, that
rule makes sense. But when it comes to
the seller, the rule about the date on which you fix damages is more
problematic. The court says that it may
not always be measured that way. When
you have a buyer who has turned around and resold the property, the damages may
be measured by actual lost profits. The
damages may also include lost opportunities, particularly improvements made by
the vendee while in possession. That's a
pretty open-ended contingent liability for the vendor as well. What does the court do with the interest rate
here? Rates were high and rising rapidly
when this case was decided. It was
1982. It was expensive to borrow because
lenders pay out <span class=SpellE>uninflated</span> dollars and get inflated
dollars back.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The last paragraph of this

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This is a great, powerful
remedy! It allows you to hold someone's
feet to the fire. If the vendor sues for
specific performance, it means that the vendee has to keep prepared to purchase
the property while the suit is pending. They must keep their financing in line. They probably can't purchase another home during the suit, since most
people can't afford to have two of them. In terms of negotiating, the ability to get specific performance is very
powerful for the vendor, just as it is for the vendee. The vendee can essentially force the vendor not
to sell to anyone else. Anyone who buys
would buy subject to the pending suit. If the vendee gets specific performance, the person who purchases while
the suit is on will lose it. Thus, it's
hard to sell the property when a suit is going on and specific performance is
being sought. An aside: "<span
class=SpellE>lis</span> <span class=SpellE>pendens</span>" means pending
litigation. Once a lawsuit is filed and
you take advantage of this doctrine, then the judgment relates back to the date
the lawsuit was filed. Sometimes you have
to give notice to trigger the doctrine, but in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, you simply must serve the summons on the adverse
party and the doctrine kicks in. Then
changes in title after that date will have no effect on the ultimate judgment.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>  There's this huge condo complex. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>What's a condo? You own "from the paint inward" in fee
simple. From the paint outward, that's
all common areas and owned by someone else. So you have some of the advantages of ownership combined with some of
the advantages of renting. The <span
class=SpellE>Boags</span> take a pretty strong approach when Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Boag</span> gets transferred. Why didn't they try to negotiate something? What does Centex want? They want specific performance, or, in the
alternative, they want to keep the earnest money as liquidated damages.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Why might the vendee be
granted specific performance in a case like this? All property is considered unique in the eyes
of the law. But are these units unique? Is that self-evident? Some land may be suited to only one purpose
or has attributes that make it different from all or most other land. But this rationale is not really factually
supported, in <span class=SpellE>Braunstein's</span> opinion. It's much easier for the vendee to get
specific performance than it is for the vendor. So what if Centex had told the <span class=SpellE>Boags</span> that
they're out of luck, and so the <span class=SpellE>Boags</span> sue for
specific performance? Would the result
have been different?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>At the end of the day, if you
order specific performance, what does the vendor get? They get money anyway! It's just that they get a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>different</i> (presumably higher) amount of
money than they would get with their remedy at law. So from the vendee's perspective, land and
money aren't fungible. But the vendor
gets money either way. So the uniqueness
of land argument doesn't seem to make much sense in this case, and it doesn't
seem to make much sense in the general case. Why should the vendor get specific performance? How about the idea that it's only fair that
each side should have the same remedies? If one person can get it, it seems like the other person ought to be
able to get it. This argument has some
force and appeal, but Braunstein doesn't think it's a strong argument. The court in this case says that it's enough
to have mutuality of obligation. They
say that as long as the contract is not illusory, that is, both parties have <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>obligations</i>, then that's enough in terms
of treating the parties <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fairly</i>. But the method by which we enforce those
obligations doesn't necessarily have to be the same.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The damage remedy may not
fully compensate the vendor because there are things that are not included, or
else it is hard to compute what the damages were. It may also be the case that it's hard to
determine the market price of the property. The property may be illiquid: maybe no one will want to buy it. We might say that when the vendor decides to
sell, all of the vendor's risks are bargained away to the vendee. When you force the vendor to seek damages,
you place those risks back on them.</span></p>

buyer say? The seller gets to keep the
$200 deposit. What's the seller's
argument? He argues that the damages
provided for in the agreement aren't his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exclusive</i>
remedy. He says that if you construe the
clause the way the court did, it's a penalty and thus against public
policy. That means he gets to sue for
his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual</i> damages, not liquidated
damages as set forth in the contract. The court says the liquidated damages clause wasn't a penalty at
all. It will be tough to get a
liquidated damages clause thrown out for being too low! You're trying to say that it's a penalty

parties enter into the contract. The
thing that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actually</i> seems to drive
the courts is whether you did a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonable</i>
pre-estimate of what the damages would be if there <span class=GramE><i

a large extent on the custom in the community. If a 10% deposit is customary, then a clause that requires forfeiture of
that deposit will be upheld, but forfeiture of a 20% deposit will be held to be
against public policy.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Does the court screw this
case up? Does the court interpret the
agreement properly? The court interprets
this agreement as an election between liquidated damages and specific
performance. The property had already
been sold, so the vendor no longer owned the property. Specific performance is no longer
possible. Then the court says that the
only remedy available is liquidated damages. But is that what the contract really says? <span class=GramE>Arguably not.</span> You can enforce an agreement by seeking
damages, right? It seems to Braunstein
that the court kind of went off on a tangent. When you bring a suit for damages, you're brining a suit to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>enforce the contract</i>. That's every bit as much an enforcement
action, according to Braunstein, as is a suit for specific performance. Can't we interpret the contract to mean that
the seller gets liquidated damages or else can sue for more if the liquidated
damages aren't enough?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This is a very odd doctrine,
and it's the kind of thing that creates traps if you're not aware of the
doctrine. Most people think that the
risk of loss is on the seller until you complete the purchase: as long as you're
in the contract stage, if something happens to the property you get out of the
contract. But the doctrine of equitable
conversion is to the contrary. It's an
old, stupid law. There are lots of
proposals to change it. We have the idea
that as soon as the contract is signed, equitable title is in the
purchaser. The purchaser is considered
to be the owner. The vendor still has
legal title to the property, but not equitable title. If the property is damaged, for example, then
the purchaser (as the owner of the property) suffers the loss, just as all
owners do. But most people don't think
that way, so the doctrine has the potential for causing problems. Around the time of hurricanes, you get lots
of cases along these lines. What's we're
doing is <span class=SpellE>recharacterizing</span> real and personal property:
that's the "conversion". The vendor
starts with real property, and the vendee starts with personal property
(money). When the contract is signed,
the vendor is said to have only personal property (the proceeds of the sale)
and the vendee is said to have real property (in equity): the title to the real
estate.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If there's no clause in the
contract allocating casualty loss, then who has it? The vendee does, because we consider the
vendee the owner of the property. This
doesn't seem consistent with regular people's expectations. Pretty much every real estate contract
written by a lawyer shifts the risk of laws and eliminates the conversion
rule. If people do this without an
attorney, they probably won't even think of discussing this. This isn't consistent with the way people
generally insure real property! The
vendor is the one who is likely to have the insurance, and the vendee won't get
the insurance until the contract closes. The vendee might fail to take the usual precautions that an ordinary
vendee would.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Note that this doctrine
doesn't apply when the vendor causes the damage. You can't burn your own house down and then
ask for the full purchase price. It also
doesn't apply when equitable title has not yet passed to the purchaser, for
example, if the title is not marketable or a condition specified in the
contract has not been fulfilled. If the
vendor is entitled to specific performance, the law treats it like it has
already occurred. But if the vendor is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> entitled to specific performance,
then the effects don't kick in.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>When we say the purchaser has
the risk, we mean that the purchaser has no right to rescind and is obligated
to complete the purchase at the agreed price. In the contract on p. 21, we see that the risk of loss is on the seller
until closing. That's more in line with
ordinary people's expectations, at least with a marketing contract as opposed
to an installment sale contract. Then
the contract tries to make a distinction between major and minor damage, using
the figure of 10% of the purchase price as a cutoff. If the damage is greater than 10%, the buyer
can choose to proceed if the seller agrees to repair or to back out of the
transaction. If the damage is less than
10%, the buyer <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must</i> proceed unless
the seller doesn't promise to fix the damage in writing.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If the vendor has the risk of
loss, the purchaser can rescind. We'll
talk about this doctrine more when we get into title, but the other possibility
is that the purchaser has the right to specific performance, but doesn't want
to have to pay full price. The purchaser
may want specific performance with abatement. They may want the transaction to go through, but they don't want to pay
full price. If the damage or defect is
not substantial, the buyer has the right to specific performance with
abatement. This usually comes up when
the vendor agrees to sell 1,000 acres of land when it turns out he only has 998
acres. It's the buyer's choice of remedy
to sue for specific performance in the first place, and equally so to sue for
specific performance with abatement.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This Act provides that when
neither legal title nor possession has been transferred, and all or a material
part is destroyed or taken in eminent domain, then the vendor can't enforce the
contract and the purchaser is entitled to recover her earnest money or any
price paid. So if neither possession nor
title has passed, the risk of loss is still on the vendor. But what is a "material part"? It means different things in different
circumstances. There is a case where the
building was destroyed and the buyer wanted to proceed with the contract
anyway. It came up under </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> law. The
seller wanted to get out of the contract. The court said that the damage wasn't material because the buyer wasn't
buying the building: the buyer planned to tear the building down as soon as the
land was purchased. So one of the
circumstances is what the intended use is by the buyer. Maybe the building that was destroyed wasn't
a material part of the consideration.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What happens if the damage is
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> material? The risk stays on the buyer because there is
no provision in the Uniform Act that would change it. What's material to a very wealthy person or
not material to a very wealthy person may be very material to someone who has
less money. So for non-material damage,
the equitable conversion doctrine continues to apply. Can the purchaser get abatement under the
Uniform Act if damage is not material? The common law applies. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>If the
purchaser would be entitled to specific performance with abatement under the
common law, then the purchaser is entitled to it here. Can the purchaser recover other expenses and
costs? Is the specific performance
remedy exclusive? We're talking about
material damage. There's nothing here
that precludes the vendee from other remedies. But it would be unlikely that the vendee would be entitled to damages as
well, because we're assuming that the difficulty was not caused by the
vendor. The doctrine of mutuality of
obligation says that if the vendor doesn't have the right to seek other
damages, then the vendee shouldn't be able to either.</span></p>

sells land under an installment sale contract. Then a judgment is entered against the vendor. We have a situation where legal title is in
the vendor. The vendor fails to pay a
bill, for example, and a judgment is entered against the vendor. Once a judgment is entered against you, it
becomes a lien against all of the real property that's owned by the judgment
debtor in that county. Its priority
dates from the date the judgment is recorded. The lien holder could go to court and ask that the property be sold at
public auction and have the judgment paid out of the proceeds. Now let's say that the vendee continues to
make payments on the contract and sells it to another vendee. Is the property, in the hands of vendee #2,
subject to the judgment lien? Vendee #2
will check the title before purchasing the property and he'll see the
lien. But once we say that vendee #1 has
good title, it means he can alienate it. One way of looking at this is to say that under the doctrine of equitable

decide whether the vendee has any interest in real property. If the vendee, who was the debtor, has any
interest in real property, then the judgment lien will attach to that interest,
and anyone who purchases from the vendee will take the property <i

bare possession is an interest in real property, or the court could say that

the property into the hands of any subsequent vendee.</span></p>

around the insurance issue. The
difficulty is that insurance is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>personal
contract</i>. It's a contract between
the insurer and the insured. It doesn't
benefit anyone else. The insurance
company doesn't want to pay off to the vendee, even if the vendee has the risk
of loss. That's pretty uniform, good
law. Some courts will say: that's fine,
but once the insured gets the money, the vendor holds the money in trust for
the vendee. This is a way of ameliorating
the harsh effect of equitable conversion. At least to the extent that there was insurance, the vendee will be
protected to that extent. It might not
be the full amount of the loss, but at least it helps to some degree.</span></p>

are discussed in the notes. How does
insurance come into play in these situations? You can get around this by simply contracting around it. You agree to keep the risk of loss with the
vendor until closing, the transfer of possession, or whatever.</span></p>

issue: what if the vendor dies, leaving all of his real property to the son and
all his personal property to the daughter? Who gets what? What does the son
get? He gets legal title, subject to the
purchaser's claim based on the contract. The son must deed the land. The
daughter gets the purchase price. That
doesn't seem fair! Wouldn't this have
surprised the vendor before his death and frustrate his intent after his
death? It's a bad result! What happens if it's the other way around,
and the purchaser dies, having left all his real property to his son and all
his personal property to his daughter? The daughter has to pay the purchase price, and the son gets the
land! Again, that frustrates the
testator's intention. But that's the way
the doctrine would work. If the
purchaser agreed to pay cash, then it doesn't matter whether the purchaser dies

may not want to rely just on my word. So
in addition to the promissory note, you have a mortgage. The mortgage is a lien for the repayment of

two sets of obligations: the promissory note and the mortgage. The purpose of the mortgage is to aid in
collection, and the way that happens is by foreclosure. But there is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>another</i> set of obligations if you don't want to use the mortgage in
aid of collection.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are many different ways
to pay off a loan. What does the
promissory note say? It tells you that
you must repay, and it says how you must do so. You can enter into a loan for 90 days, at which point all interest
accrued and the principal is paid all at once. That's very unusual for a long-term mortgage, though. It doesn't make sense! You could also have level payments with
interest only: pay the interest each year, and then pay the principal back at
the end of the loan. This type of loan
is used frequently for a commercial loan where the loan won't be in place for a
very long time. But these aren't used very
often in residential real estate transactions. These <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>were</i> used before the
Great Depression, when the idea of interest-only was more popular. Mortgages were much shorter in length. But interest-only led to a lot of defaults,
and a kind of cascading effect. You
could have a level payment that is some arbitrary amount. You could pay interest plus a certain amount
of principal each month, followed by a payment of the remainder of the
principal at the end of the loan. This
is used with income-producing property. You pay the interest plus a given amount of the principal. You negotiate based on what the income of the
building is.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The last and most common way
to pay off the loan is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fully
amortized</i> mortgage, meaning that once you establish a term and an interest
rate, you do a calculation. If you make
a payment of a certain amount, then at the end of the term, the mortgage will
be paid in full: principal <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
interest. It's a constant payment of the
same amount every month, and by the time you make the last payment, the loan is
fully repaid. The last payment will be
the same amount that the first one was. This is the most common mortgage, especially for residential transactions.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We went over the kinds of payment
arrangements you can have with a mortgage. There's one more: you don't have to amortize the mortgage over the term
of the mortgage. You can do smaller
payments but then pay off the rest of the total as a lump sum at the end of the
term: a "balloon" or "bullet". This is
primarily done when you have seller financing due to the fact that interest
rates are high or the buyer doesn't have enough money for the down
payment. The seller will finance the
purchase price, but will only agree to finance for five years or so.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>When you start out paying a
mortgage, you're paying mostly interest and little principal, but then it
gradually shifts over the term of the mortgage. Each month, the interest is getting smaller because it's calculated on
the outstanding principal. The interest
is calculated each month based on what you owe at the time. As you pay less interest, you take the
difference and put it into playing for principal. This makes up the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>amortization curve</i>. The
slope of the curve is relatively flat at the top: you pay a lot of interest in
the first few years and not so much principal. But near the end, you're paying primarily principal rather than
interest. You don't have a month where
you pay more principal than interest until you get a good ways towards the end
of the term. What does this say about
refinancing? People do it all the
time. When interest rates go down,
people refinance. But when you
refinance, you move back to the beginning of the curve! Remember that the interest is tax-deductible,
while the principal is not. If you
refinance and don't take cash out and you keep your payment the same, then
you'll end up better off: you'll pay off the loan faster. If you take money out, you're even worse off:
it's like you go further back than where you started!</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There is a very strong policy
(that Braunstein doesn't understand) in favor of encouraging people to buy
houses. The idea is that it's good for
people to own houses. It may be good for
people to own <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>something</i>, but why
houses in particular? Historically, it
may make sense with World War II veterans needing a place to live. We wanted to enhance their ability to buy
houses. You can argue that we <span
class=SpellE>overconsume</span> housing: when you compare savings rates in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> to savings rates in other countries, <span
class=GramE>it's</span> lower, and one reason is that we invest so much in
housing. We do that, in turn, because
the government subsidizes it. Is <span
class=GramE>this such</span> a great place to invest money as a society? It's sort of a Jeffersonian democracy ideal:
a farmer who owns his own land is a better citizen for being an owner. But why is it so much better to own a house
than to save money or invest in stock? This policy is reflected in how to make mortgage payments smaller.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>You can reduce your payments
by reducing the amount of principal you borrow. You could also try to get a lower interest rate. There are many programs designed to reduce
interest rates. For example, the state
borrows a bunch of money at 3-4% and then <span class=SpellE>reloans</span> it
to home buyers for 4-5%. The state makes
a little money and the homebuyer gets an interest rate lower than what they
would be able to get on their own.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Another way to make the
interest rate lower is to have the Fed fiddle with the interest rate. The interest rate equals the true cost of
money (an absolutely safe investment, with no inflation, about 2-3%) plus the
inflation risk plus the cost of credit risk. The federal government may intervene to reduce the risk of certain loans
by insuring them, shifting the credit risk from the mortgage lender to the
federal government. Note that there have
been mortgage devices created to reduce inflation risk, like <span
class=SpellE>ARMs</span>. If you can
adjust the rate of the mortgage every year based on an index, then you take
less of a risk with respect to inflation. Also, it doesn't seem to make sense to pay extra for a 30 year mortgage
when you're only going to live there for seven years.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Also, the longer you have to
repay the loan, the less you'll pay every month. However, the total cost of the mortgage will
also be greater over the life of the loan. You could also change the amortization rate so that your monthly payment
is lower, but then you have the balloon/bullet coming at you at the end.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What options do the parties
have in terms of the particular transaction, say a house for $125,000? First, you can have a cash sale. Buyer gives the money, the seller gives the
deed, the buyer records the deed, and that's it. Second, you could have a cash sale while
paying off an existing mortgage. The
seller delivers the deed, the buyer pays the money. Then the seller goes and uses the cash to pay
off the mortgage. The buyer could get a
new loan and use it to pay cash. The
buyer secures the loan with the deed. The buyer could also take over the seller's old loan instead of having
it paid off. If the old loan was a good
deal, the buyer may want to keep it alive.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>You could also have seller
financing, in whole or in part. The
buyer could pay a cash down payment plus a promissory note and mortgage for the
balance in exchange with the deed to the property (encumbered by the
outstanding mortgage). In that
situation, the seller wears two hats. The seller basically is the same person as the lender to the buyer. You could combine seller financing and taking
over an existing mortgage. If the buyer
doesn't have enough money for the down payment, the buyer might take over the
existing mortgage and then have the seller finance the down payment. The buyer could give the seller an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>additional note </i>and a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>second mortgage</i>. "Second mortgage" refers to the priority with
which the mortgagees get paid off. These
priorities are based on time.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Finally, we have wrapping
around an existing mortgage loan. The
terminology isn't really helpful. This
is really a combination of seller financing and keeping the existing mortgage
in effect. The difference is that the
new mortgage is for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>total amount
that's being lent</i>. The new, second
mortgage will represent the total purchase price minus whatever cash is
paid. The second mortgage is for the
full purchase price less the down payment instead of the difference between the
existing mortgage and the new mortgage. The seller has the advantage of being in control, because the buyer
makes a payment that is sufficient to pay the old mortgage <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>and</i> the new one. Then the
seller pays the old lender. The seller <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knows</i> if payments aren't being made and
if a loan is about to go into default. When the buyer does it, the seller may not find out about a default
until it's too late to do anything about it. For a wraparound to be beneficial, you must be able to keep the old loan
in effect, and that loan must have a lower interest rate than current market
rates. Both of those are highly
problematic in the current environment: wraparounds aren't important right now.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>How does the seller make
money on a wraparound? The seller is
really loaning $110,000 and really getting paid $885 a month. What the seller is doing is not loaning his <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>own</i> money: he's <span class=SpellE>reloaning</span>
the money from the old lender at a higher interest rate. He's borrowing money from the old lender at a
lower interest rate and then <span class=SpellE>reloaning</span> it at a higher
rate. If the old loan was at 7% and <span
class=SpellE>reloan</span> it at 9%, then you're making a lot of interest on
the "new money". The return to the
lender is quite high! At the same time,
the interest rate paid by the borrower is below market rate. The borrower and seller do well, but the
original lender suffers. Lenders will
object to this! They'll object to any
situation where the buyer takes the property encumbered by an existing loan
when rates have gone up. These were very
popular when it was harder for lenders to enforce "due-on-sale" clauses. Now, this kind of financing has become less
popular and valuable.</span></p>

$37,500 to be financed in a wraparound mortgage. There is an old mortgage to <span
class=SpellE>Amfac</span> for $31,800, $7,000 in cash, and the wrap is $37,500
even though that's not the new money being advanced by the seller. How much money is the seller actually
advancing? He's advancing $5,700. If it were a cash sale, he would get $12,700,
but in reality, with the loan, he's only getting $7,000 cash. So the new loan is only $5,700. The loan was amortized over 30 years, but due
in three years. At the end of the third
year, when the mortgage must be paid off, we find some of it has already been
paid. The balance on the mortgage at the
end of the three years will be $36,657. Payments have been made on the <span class=SpellE>Amfac</span> mortgage,
and the balance of that one will be $30,181. So the seller gets $6,476 in net cash. Where does the $776 come from? The <span class=SpellE>Amfac</span> mortgage is amortizing more quickly
than the new wraparound mortgage. The <span
class=SpellE>Amfac</span> mortgage principal amount goes down by $1,600 while
the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Benton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> wraparound principal is only reduced by $843the
difference is the extra $776. It's a
great deal! It's like a 20% return overall,

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Wraparound mortgages were
very popular back in the day! The seller
got a great return on their investment, and the buyer got a good deal too. Only the bank got screwed. <span class=SpellE>Amfac</span> didn't like
the deal! If they could get the money
back, they could <span class=SpellE>relend</span> it at current rates. They could lend it to the <span class=SpellE>Schraders</span>
or someone else entirely. They would
like to get rid of old, low interest rate loans. They exercise their "due on sale" clause,
which is included in virtually every mortgage contract prepared by a commercial
lender. These clauses may not be present
in mortgages made by individuals, or you may be able to bargain around
them. The "due on sale" clause is
required to make a loan saleable to FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The court said that the
buyers could either pay all cash or could assume the existing loan on terms
acceptable to <span class=SpellE>Amfac</span> and then pay the sellers the
$12,700. This is all the same to the
lenders. The court says that the buyers
could assume the mortgage, pay $7,000 cash, and give the seller a second mortgage
for $5,700 due in two years. The court
of appeals doesn't like this! They say
that the trial court abused their discretion in offering this option to the <span
class=SpellE>Schraders</span>. The
problem here was that the parties bargained without considering the "due on sale"
clause. The only way to negotiate an
arrangement like this is to bring the lender in to the negotiations.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>With a wraparound mortgage,
the buyer gives the seller a note and mortgage for the entire amount of the
indebtedness. The buyer makes payments on
that loan at whatever rate they agreed upon. The seller would take a portion of those payments and pay them to the
original lender. The seller is in a
position to assure that the payments are made on time. But if you do a second mortgage and the buyer
doesn't pay, the seller has no way of knowing until he gets a notice that the
mortgage is in default.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The courts of equity come in
and develop the concept of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>equity of
redemption</i> (more specifically, the equity of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>tardy</i> redemption). The
mortgagor can come in late and pay the mortgage, even though the law courts
wouldn't have allowed it. The courts of
equity say: "You're late, but so what?" You originally had to provide a good reason, but later you didn't really
need to. But that creates another set of
problems. The mortgagees say that if
you're late but have the right to pay off the mortgage, how late can you
be? How do you terminate the
equity? The doctrine that the courts
come up with is a process for foreclosing the equity of redemption. Everybody talks about foreclosing the
mortgage, but it's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not really the
mortgage that's being foreclosed</i>. What's being foreclosed is the further exercise of the equity of
redemption, that is, your <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>right</i> to
pay off the mortgage. The result is that
the court sets an "outside date", which is essentially the date of sale. The court orders that the sheriff seize and
sell the property at public auction. That is the date beyond which the mortgagor cannot exercise the equity
of redemption. The courts in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span

mortgage as a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, it was very much
like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strict foreclosure</i>, meaning that
the mortgagee is not required to sell the property. The mortgagee, upon declaring a default and
foreclosing the equity of redemption, simply becomes the owner of the
property. But the problem with that is
that the mortgagee may get a windfall because whatever equity the mortgagor has
in the property is lost and held in its entirety by the mortgagee.</span></p>

  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Vermont</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>). Instead,
foreclosure by sale is required, the benefit of which is two-fold: (1) you
generate cash under circumstances controlled by the law so that there is some
assurance of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reasonableness</i> of the
manner in which the sale is conducted. (2) The cash is distributed to the parties <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>to whom it's due</i>. The
mortgagee only gets the amount of the debt outstanding, and if there is any
surplus it will go to junior mortgagees, and then to the mortgagor in the value
of the mortgagor's equity. But how often
is there any surplus? There is no
surplus in a majority of cases. If the
proceeds from the sale of the property don't satisfy the debt in full, the
debtor will be personally liable for the balance.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There is a so-called rule
against "clogging". Mortgagees would
sometimes demand that mortgagors waive the equity of redemption. This was found to be against public policy
and would not be upheld. The assumption
is that the mortgagor and mortgagee have unequal bargaining power and that the
law will be entirely circumvented if we allow these waivers to take place. The circumstances under which the courts find
an attempted waiver can be surprising. Courts look very closely at mortgage deals to look for anything that
looks like a waiver of the equity of redemption.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Before default and
acceleration, you have the legal right of redemption: you may have the right to
pre-pay, you may have to wait until a specified date, but the law lets you
eventually take the property free of the encumbrance and hold it in fee simple
absolute. After default but before
foreclosure, there is the equitable right of redemption, which is what we've
just been talking about. After
foreclosure, you have a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>statutory</i>
right of redemption in some states (mainly Midwestern farm states not including

developed during the Depression with the idea that people were losing their property,
and if people could just wait a little while, values would bounce back up (but
this was overoptimistic  it took until the 1950's for the prices to reach
pre-Depression level). The idea was that
the person foreclosed upon had time to raise the money to get the property back
from the purchaser at the auction.</span></p>

to protect itself from that risk by raising interest rates or changing some
other term of the mortgage. There's no
free lunch here! The person who buys the
property at the foreclosure sale in a state with statutory redemption will
probably get it at a discount because they're taking subject to statutory
restrictions. That increases the
personal liability for the person who suffers the foreclosure. The farm lobby is powerful! The farm states all get two senators.</span></p>

mortgage will be considered to still be in existence for certain purposes. What if a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>second
mortgagee </i>forecloses? Who owns
what? The purchaser at foreclosure gets
the title as it was just before the mortgage was entered into, namely, they
take the property <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>encumbered by the first
mortgage</i>. [See hypo in slides]</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Junior mortgages are more
risky because you get paid second. What's a less obvious reason? The
second mortgagee can't control the timing of the foreclosure, and that may be
important. If you're in a situation
where your judgment as the lender is that if you wait you can sell the property
for more money later than now, and if you're in control of the foreclosure
process, then you can decide to wait. But if you're the second mortgagee, you can't control the timing. The first mortgagee is in control. If you have a sale by the first mortgagee,
the purchaser will pay no more than fair market value. But if you have a sale by the second
mortgagee, you buy for fair market value minus the value of the first
mortgage. When the second mortgage
forecloses, the first mortgagee receives none of the proceeds of the sale, but
the mortgage is still in effect. The
first mortgagee can foreclose later.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This is a <i

for this device is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> to get around
the equitable right of redemption. It's
designed so that the lender can purchase <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>at
the lender's own foreclosure sale</i>. In some states, mortgagees couldn't bid at their own sale, meaning that
they couldn't control the property anymore. So this device was created to allow the person who would be the
mortgagee to purchase at the lender's own foreclosure sale. This also gives the lender the option whether
to go through judicial foreclosure or to exercise the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>power of sale</i>, which happens by statute and without much
intervention by the courts. Three people
are involved: the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>grantor</i> is the same
as the mortgagor. The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>trustee </i>is the new person in this
transaction, but the trustee's sole job is to get the deed to the property and
then to <span class=SpellE>reconvey</span> it to the grantor when the deed of
trust is paid off. The "trust form" is
borrowed for the purposes of getting around restrictions in certain dates.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>These are designed to avoid
the equity of redemption. One is the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>covenant not to <span class=SpellE>coney</span>
or <span class=GramE>encumber</span></i> the property. The bank asks the mortgagor to promise not to
convey the property to anyone else or use it for collateral in any other
transaction. It's not a very powerful
device, but it at least keeps some property there that will be available to
satisfy the bank's personal judgment. The second thing you can do is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>just
lie</i>. Instead of a mortgage, the
borrower conveys the property to the lender without reference to a loan, but
with a secret agreement that it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> a
mortgage. This doesn't work either, but
the idea is that in the event of a default, you don't have to go through
foreclosure or sale or anything else. These kinds of deeds are actually quite easy to set aside if you can
prove this arrangement. Finally, you
have the installment or land sale contract. This looks like a purchase agreement, but in substance it's a
mortgage. Law treats the last two as
mortgages. The first one is not treated
by a mortgage. You have a cause of
action for breach of contract, but you don't have the priority that a mortgage
would have given.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Warranties of title are just
contracts. They're only as good as the
solvency of the person who makes the warranty. It can be a long time before any defect is discovered! It could be hard to collect at the time you
find out the title is bad. Also, you
don't really know what the state of the title is. You're just being promised that the other
person has good title. You don't get any
evidence of the truth of the promise. The other systems for title assurance give you at least some evidence
that the person who is saying the title is good <span class=GramE>has</span>
actually checked to some degree if that's the true state of affairs. So warranty titles are a little "flaky": it's
a "band-aid". In most states, including </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, if you call something a "warranty deed", all the
statutory warranties are automatically included.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, the warranties are listed at R.C. 5302.06. "The grantor covenants with the grantee, his
heirs, assigns, and successors" This
means that the all of the covenants run with the land. In some states, the present warranties don't
run with the land; only future warranties. This statute says that both past <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and
</i>future warranties run with the land. The importance of that is that if A transfers to B and B transfers to C,
there's a breach, and A's the one with the money, you want to be able to sue A. We don't want C limited to an action against
his immediate predecessor in interest. It is warranted that "he is lawfully seized in fee simple of the granted
premises".</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>It is warranted that the
property is "free and clear from all encumbrances". What are encumbrances? They're <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bad
things</i> like mortgages, easements, leases: anything that takes away one of
the sticks out of the bundle of sticks that constitutes a fee simple
absolute. The only thing that isn't
considered an encumbrance is if you own less than you purport to convey in the
deed. The most important encumbrance
would be a monetary encumbrance such as a mortgage or judgment lien. It is warranted that "he has good right to
sell and convey the same". This comes up
in situations involving corporations. Maybe only the president has the power to transfer real estate, but the
deed is signed by the vice-president or secretary.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The grantor also "warrants"
the title: this means that it is promised that no one with a paramount title to
the grantor will evict the grantee. The
grantor also promises to "defend" the grantee and his heirs and
successors. That's kind of tricky: if
you sue someone to defend your title, you can sue the grantor for attorney's
fees. But if you lose, you have to pay
your own attorney's fees.</span></p>

marital status. Why does the marital
status matter? You want to know who has
to execute the deed. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, there are still dower rights in limited
circumstances. If it's a married person,
the spouse must execute the deed. You
include the grantee and their tax mailing address. You describe the land, which is often a plat
in a subdivision. It could also be a
"metes and bounds" description, where you start at a certain place and then
follow a certain path. You also mention
if there are any restrictions such as encumbrances, reservations, exceptions,
and so on. You also include a reference
to the instrument by which the grantor obtained the property. Also, if you note that the person is married,
you have the spouse release dower rights. The form says that only the signature of the grantor is necessary, but
in fact to get the deed recorded, you must get an acknowledgement in front of a
notary. <span class=GramE>The only way

style='font-size:11.0pt'>Brown v. <span class=SpellE>Lober</span></span></i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>  What are they claiming as the breach of the
covenant here? They thought they had all
the coal rights, but the grantor reserved two-thirds of the rights. They claim that the covenant of warranty has
been breached. The court holds that
there was no constructive eviction. The
coal company searched the title and found there was a reservation of two thirds
of the interest in the coal. The
plaintiffs claim that this constitutes an eviction because the grantor didn't
tell them about this reservation. But
the court holds that this isn't an eviction because the plaintiffs weren't
denied possession of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subsurface</i>. One thing that doesn't constitute eviction is
the fact that you turned out not to have good title: you must have more than
just that. Was there a breach of the
covenant of seisin? <span class=GramE>Absolutely.</span> They didn't own it, because the grantor had
reserved two-thirds of the coal. They
lose because the statute of limitations for bringing an action for breach of
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>present</i> covenant had started to
run on the date of the delivery of the deed, which was over ten years ago. This seems like an odd position for the
plaintiffs to be in. They say it's too
late to bring the action for breach of covenant of seisin, but it's too early
for them to bring an action for quiet enjoyment.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This is an example of a case
where it was not prudent to rely on the lender. The surface was enough collateral to rely on for the loan, and so they
didn't care about the subsurface rights. But once we get past the statute of limitations on the covenant of
seisin, the likelihood of an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual</i>
eviction based on this title defect gets increasingly less probable. If they haven't shown up in ten years, they
probably won't show up at all. To award
damages in a case like this creates a substantial risk of miscalculation: you
might be awarding damages for a bad thing that's never going to occur. Why not just live with the uncertainty? In that way, what the court does here makes
sense. Say the coal company starts
mining the coal, and then the person owning the outstanding two-thirds interest
shows up and complains. What result
then? Would we advise the coal company
to start mining the coal? If the seller
has the means to pay the previous grantor, then they reimburse the person who
really owns the two-thirds. Doesn't that
require that the person who owns the two-thirds to come forward and claim
it? The other reason to start mining the
coal is because the only way that they're ever going to clear up their title is
to acquire the coal by adverse possession. But in order to possess the coal, you must use it in some way.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What damages would they be
entitled to when the true owner comes forward? Can they get the value of the coal? They basically get rescission. In
whole or in part, what the grantee will get as a remedy for the breach of
covenants of title is the consideration that the grantee paid. Basically you just unwind the
transaction. If I bought the land for
$10,000 and it turns out that the grantor didn't own any of it, I get the
$10,000. If I happened to build a
factory on that land or the value of the land went way up, it's just too
bad. You don't get expectation <span
class=GramE>damages,</span> you just get back what you paid. In this case, however, at worst, only a
portion of the land will be lost. The
only defect we know of has to do with the subsurface rights.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Let's say the purchase price
is $50,000 and the value of two-thirds of the coal is $75,000. How much does the grantee recover from the
grantor? You won't get more than
rescission, and in fact you'll get less. You haven't lost everything; you've only lost a portion. Your loss is greater than the consideration
you've paid. You would think that in the
case of this partial loss you would get the $50,000 back. What you're entitled to is some ratio of the
value of the coal relative to the value of the entire property that you
purchased. Let's say the true value of
the property is $150,000, so you've lost 50% of the value of the property. That's your recovery: you get 50% of the
consideration paid. That's not a great
remedy for several reasons. You're not
getting back your entire damages. You're
getting nothing for improvements made to the land or future appreciation. These breaches of covenant can be outstanding
for a long time. It doesn't seem fair to
make people bear a contingent liability for a long time for a large and
hard-to-determine amount. So we limit
liability to return of the consideration.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What the court does makes
sense, but it creates a problem in terms of mining this coal. They take a risk if they mine it in that the
people who truly own the coal could show up, claim conversion, and attempt to
get punitive damages.</span></p>

common law. The common law says "first

style='font-size:11.0pt'>, but it's a problem today. Unless you have some way of checking title,
you have no way of knowing if A sold the property. The presumption is always that the first
transferee wins. The burden switches to
the second transferee to show that there is an exception to the common law
rule, namely, the Recording Acts. These
acts vary a little by state. Typically,
they require that the second transferee be in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>good faith</i>. In order for the
second transferee to win, the second transferee must be innocent. They must not have known about the earlier
transfer.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The purpose of the Recording
Acts is to protect people who acted in good faith and property in
commerce. The person must say that they
took without notice and for value. The
property wasn't just given to the transferee. Finally, the property right at issue must be one capable of being recorded. This is the interplay between the statute of
frauds and the Recording Acts. The
statute of frauds says that if you will transfer an interest in real property,
it must be in writing. The Recording
Acts say that you better record the writing or else it won't count. But there are exceptions to the statute of
frauds. In any case where your interest
is based on an exception to the statute of frauds, that is, an interest that can
be created without a writing, it's also an exception to the Recording Acts, and
you revert to common law.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>"First in time, first in
right" is the rule unless you can take advantage of the Recording Acts. You can do so if the interest was created by
an instrument. If you have an
instrument, it's capable of being recorded. But if there's no instrument, there's nothing to record, and thus an
exception to the Acts. Take some
hypotheticals: O conveys the property to A on the first day. On the second day, O conveys the property to
B. Who's the owner of the property? First in time, first in right under the
common law, so A owns the property. You
can't sell what you don't own! O doesn't
have the right to convey the property to B because he's already sold it to
A. He's committed a tort! He doesn't have the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>right</i> to do what he's done, but he does have that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>power</i>, to convey a good title to B even
though he didn't own the property at the time. The source of that power is the Recording Acts: the whole panoply of
acts that make up the Recording Acts. These statutes, taken together, are designed to create a public record
of land ownership. We want the public to
be able to rely on these records with some degree of confidence. That's why we must give O the power to convey
a title that he doesn't own.</span></p>

and pays value. It turns out, under a
notice <span class=GramE>statute,</span> B is the owner of the property! Does that mean B doesn't have to record? No. If
O tries to transfer to C without notice then C is the subsequent purchaser and
will prevail over B. The Recording Acts
don't create a criminal penalty for not reporting, but they create a very
strong <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>incentive</i> to record. Until you record, your title is at risk from
subsequent good-faith purchasers. But
the Recording Acts create no incentive to "<span class=SpellE>unrecord</span>"
or "erase". There is no provision to
erase. The public record gets longer and
longer. There is no editing process
that's even permitted. There are certain
procedures that are followed, but that's all. The best way to give <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>notice</i> is

folks. If you just go by the law of
contracts, the other folks have no claim. They're in privity of contract with
the contractor. They can sue the
contractor if they want, but they have no claim against the owner because
there's no contract between the owner and any of those people. Unjust enrichment may or may not help. Therefore, the law creates a lien in favor of

certain number of days since you last did work, it relates back in time to the
date you <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>first</i> worked. Therefore, your priority is from the date the
work first commenced. This means that

wins? B wins because B didn't have notice
of the A transaction when he bought. If
you rely on the common law, gifts are actually the best way to get property! There's nothing wrong with the gift, and A

then B lends money to O, and then gets a mortgage from O for no
consideration? Is B a purchaser for
value? The mortgage wasn't given in
consideration of any value. It doesn't
have to be much to support the mortgage. He could give a little bit of consideration, and that would be enough to
make B a purchaser. The consideration
doesn't have to be fair or anything, it just has to be valuable. What if it's the same situation except O
gives B a deed to satisfy the debt? Is B
a purchaser for value? Then there's
plenty of consideration. B had a right

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>How can B get notice of A's
rights? There are four ways: (1) actual
knowledge, (2) recorded documents, (3) persons in possession, or (4) the duty
to inquire from any of the above. The
principal basis for the Recording Acts is constructive or actual notice from
recorded documents. If you look in the
record, you'll see things and have notice that way. But even if you don't look in the record,
you're still deemed to know what you would have known <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>if</i> you had looked. In order
to get notice from the person in possession, it must be somebody <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other than you'd expect</i>. So what's really the difference between a
race <span class=GramE>jurisdiction</span> versus a race-notice or notice
jurisdiction? If you're in a race state,
you only have to look at the public record. If an earlier deed is not of record, you know that you'll win. In a race-notice jurisdiction, you must look
not just at the public record, but also the property itself. If notice is required, then if there is
someone in possession inconsistent with the record title, you'll be deemed to
know that for the purposes of determining whether you're a bona fine purchaser.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>You may not know everything,
but you may know something. There may be
a recorded document that you actually see, but it's defective. Or you might see someone on the property who
isn't the person selling it to you. A
defectively recorded document still gives you notice of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>something</i>: someone is claiming an interest in the property. Once you see that, you're required to make a
reasonable investigation, and you're charged with notice of anything that <span
class=GramE>a such</span> an investigation would reveal. Thus, you might not have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>complete</i> notice, but you may have enough notice to require you to
dig deeper. Only certain documents can
be recorded, as specified by the statutes, but the recorder will accept
virtually anything. Frequently, when
there is a dispute concerning title, an affidavit will be recorded saying a
certain person claims interest in the property. That doesn't charge you with notice because it's outside the statute,
but it creates the duty to investigate the claim in the affidavit to see if
they're valid or not.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Let's say a neighbor informs
a potential buyer about an unrecorded deed. Then you have <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual notice</i>. Let's say O gives <span class=GramE>A</span>
an unrecorded easement, then O takes out a mortgage with X, and the mortgage
mentions the easement. The mortgage is
recorded. The easement itself isn't
recorded, but a purchaser, if they search the record, will be charged with at
least inquiry notice of the easement. Of
course, what constitutes a reasonable inquiry is a question of fact. But if you don't see <span class=GramE>the
mortgage, then you're</span> not charged with inquiry notice and you'll take
free of the easement.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>One of the most common forms
of notice is when you have someone in possession whose possession is
inconsistent with the record ownership. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>For example, there's a transfer from O to A
that's unrecorded. O goes to sell the
house to B, but A is in possession. B is
charged with notice that something is wrong in a race-notice or notice
jurisdiction. This happens all the
time. What happens if it turns out that
A is really O's son? Is that possession
inconsistent with the public record? Maybe A has a short term lease. You're on notice that there is a lease if you say that there is a
tenant, and you are also on notice of anything that a reasonable inquiry would
reveal about the lease. That means you
probably have to talk to all the tenants or look at all their leases. When people buy commercial buildings that are
rented, they must get information on all the tenants and what's called an
"estoppel letter" from each tenant saying that they are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

time, you won't have to look at the old records at all. The old records are "truly disgusting"! They're nasty! They're kept in large books (both indices and

index: (1) <span class=GramE>It's</span> expensive to administer because you
must make sure that each document is being recorded under the right tract. There must be someone in the office <span
class=GramE>who</span> can double check these things, especially considering
that one big tract in 1900 could be 1,000 little tracts in 2000. Keeping track of the tracts is not an easy
process. In the western </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

is that if you have a survey based on metes and bounds, it becomes impossible
to have a tract index. We started out

index, you have the type of instrument, the grantee's name, the grantor's name,
information on where you can find the document, and what tract of land the
document relates to. The grantee index
is same thing, except for how they're alphabetized. The grantor's index is alphabetized under the

have a method of search to determine everyone who has been an owner or owned an
interest in a certain property from some date forward. You want to find that whoever you're
interested in now (for example, the buyer is interested in the seller) is the
current owner. So you work
backwards. You only know who the current
owner is. When we looked at the general
warranty deed, it included a blank for the book and page of the prior

search.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>So you start in the grantee
index, starting today, and you look backwards in time. At some point, you should find that O, the
person you're getting ready to buy from, was a grantee. You get the deed itself and make sure it's
valid. Then you're done with looking
under O's name in the grantee index. If
it's B that was O's grantor (you find a transfer from B to O), then you must
ask: how did B become the owner of the property? At some previous date, B must have been a
grantee. So you look in the grantee
index under B's name. You keep looking
and find that B was a grantee and A had previously conveyed the property to
B. <span class=GramE>So you start
looking under A's name.</span> You keep
looking back until you find a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>patent</i>

whole picture! The next problem is that
under the Recording Acts, O only has good title if O and everyone in the chain
of title was a bona fine purchaser. So
if we're in a race-notice jurisdiction, we must look at B and make sure that
B's deed was recorded prior to any other deed from A. We must make sure that no one in this chain
of title sold the property to someone <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>outside</i>
of the chain of title prior to selling it to the next person in the chain of
title. We have to make sure A didn't
sell to X before <span class=GramE>A</span> sold it to B. So the next step is to start with <span
class=GramE>A</span>, look in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>grantor's</i>
index, and search until we find the recorded deed to B. If we find a deed to X before the deed to B,
then we have big problems! That would
mean that B, at least in a race-notice or race jurisdiction, is a "loser" and
didn't get good title! In a notice
jurisdiction, it will be a little more complicated. But if we assume that the deed from A to X

that B was first to record and thus has "won". So you start searching under B's name and search until you find a
transfer from B to O. You shouldn't find
anything intervening. That would mean
that O acquired good title. Then you
search under O's name from the time O acquired title until the present, which

without the index. But in this
situation, searching the index won't help B because the recorder's office made
a mistake. Who wins? Some states would say that B loses, but
Braunstein thinks that's dumb. The mere
recordation of the instrument doesn't do you any good unless you have a way to
find it. You can't say B has notice of
something that's impossible to find! What do you do if you're a careful attorney? A has a potential problem: there's a transfer
from O to A, A has recorded. So if
you're <span class=GramE>A</span> you better check the records to make sure
that the deed was both <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>recorded</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>indexed</i>. This is a cheap process that A should undertake. That's why A should lose if he doesn't do
this. In some states, the index isn't
considered part of the public record at all, and B loses, and Braunstein thinks
that's dumb. That's the <i

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>A transfer from A to B and
then from B to Y who doesn't record and then to Z who does record. Then B transfers to C, who doesn't have any
actual notice of the unrecorded deed from B to Y. The problem is that there is a deed in the
record. There's a recording of the
transfer from Y to Z, but C has no reason to look in the index under "Y". When C is getting ready to purchase from B,
he looks in the grantee index and finds that B was a grantee from A. He also finds that A was a grantor to B. There was no transfer between when A acquired
it and when it was sold to B. There's no
transfer from B on the books. Therefore,
it appears that the title is clean. How
do you decide that C ought to win over Z? You could argue that both of them are innocent parties. But it looks like Z didn't do a proper title
search. What should Z have done? Z should have had Y record the deed. Then Z would have good title and C would have
notice in the record.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The statute says that the
only people who can take advantage of the Recording Acts are people who took
without notice and whose deed was the first recorded. But Z's deed was the first recorded! C has no practical way to find out about the
transfer from B to Y and then Y to Z. Z
can find out there's a problem and solve it rather cheaply. It would be very expensive for C to solve the
problem. The policy is that we ought to
put the loss on the least cost avoider, which is what will tend to make the
Recording Acts effective. C can't say
that his deed was first recorded. But we
deem Z's deed as unrecorded. What we do
is that we read into the statute (sometimes because it's there and sometimes
because courts imply it) that deeds must be "duly" or "properly" recorded. We say that Z knew that there was a break in
the chain of title and that Z should have done something to fix it. Therefore, C, who took without notice and
recorded before Z straightened the situation up, prevails. If we had a tract index, then C would have
notice! C would see everything except
the transfer from B to Y. This particular
wild deed problem would be solved by the tract index.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Title insurance is an odd
thing. It's not insurance in the typical
sense. Typically, if you buy, for
example, life insurance, the insurance company knows that it will suffer a
loss, but it just doesn't know when. Title insurance doesn't work that way. If everything works right, the title insurance company should <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i> suffer a loss, that is, there
should <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>never</i> be a valid claim against
the insurance policy. But not everything
always works the way it should. There
can be off record risks such as fraud. There can also be violations of zoning laws, covenants and restrictions,
and so on. All of these are detectable
and should be detected if title insurance works the way it should.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Here's how it works: with the
typical policy, you fill out Schedule A with the elements of the fee simple
absolute. The Schedule A in the book at
p. 236 is a bit different in two respects: not all of the risks are for the
full policy amount. But it does have a
space to fill in your interest in the land, for example: "fee simple
absolute". Inflation protection is
available for title insurance policies. The other thing that makes title insurance different than most policies
is that it's a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>single-premium policy</i>. At the time you purchase the property, you
pay a premium that is calculated as a percentage of the amount of insurance,
and then that's it. It's a one-time
payment for coverage basically forever. If there's a mistake in the policy, that is, if there is some loss that
is covered by the policy, then the policy doesn't necessarily pay the full
amount of the loss. You do the same
calculation of damages that you do with warranties of title. Title insurance only insures legal
matters. It doesn't deal with acreage or
quality of the land.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Who pays for title
insurance? In </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-size:11.0pt'>Central Ohio</span></st1:place><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, the standard contracts have the seller pay for title
insurance, not the buyer. Even though
the seller pays for the title insurance, the buyer is entitled to pick the
title insurance company. That's a matter
of federal law: the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Under RESPA, the buyer has the right to pick
the title insurance company.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In Schedule B, exceptions and
exclusions are listed. "Schedule A <span
class=SpellE>giveth</span>, and Schedule B <span class=SpellE>taketh</span>
away." If you look at Schedule B, you'll
see why there should never really be a claim under a title insurance
policy. Exceptions should be everything
that a diligent search of the public records would reveal: liens, leases,
easements and so on. You're not insured against
losses resulting from any of those things. You have a vested fee simple absolute except for everything that's in
the public records and is a defect in the title. As a result, if the title insurance company
is careful, then you won't suffer any loss at all. If an encumbrance is not of record, you don't
take subject to it, and if it is of record, the title insurance policy doesn't
cover you. If you don't read Schedule B,
you don't really know what insurance you have, if any.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In addition to the exceptions
that are specific to that property, there are also exclusions that are general
to all policies issued by the title insurance company. You can negotiate to have some of them
removed for a price. The most important
exclusion is the exclusion for things that are known by the buyer at the
closing date but not known by the company. You can't hide defects from the <span class=GramE>company,</span> you
must disclose all defects to the company. The Schedule B exceptions listed on p. 239 are more similar to the way
we would see them drawn up on a policy issued in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Is a title policy an opinion
of title? Isn't there an incentive on
the part of the title insurance company not to search the title at all? It depends on how high the search costs are. You could do this on an actuarial basis. You could say: "We've been in this business a
long time, and we know what the risk is." You could charge a premium based on the historical risk rather than
doing a search of the title. This may
make more sense for the title insurance company than for the purchaser of the
property, since title insurance won't cover your full loss. If you sue, you might be disappointed that
the title insurance companies aren't trying to determine if the title is
marketable. Is the title company
obligated to be reasonable in conducting a search? What difference does it make? You might want to find a basis for tort
liability if your policy doesn't fully cover your loss.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What happens if you have
something that is a matter of record but it's not listed in Schedule B? Is the title insurance company liable? Sure they are! That's exactly what they're supposed to
do. What if there is something that's a
matter of record, isn't on Schedule B, but also comes within one of the
exclusions? <span class=GramE>For
example, "encroachments or questions of location, boundary and area, which an
accurate survey may disclose".</span> You can't rely on the policy to tell you that this condition doesn't
exist. Say there is an easement that a
survey would reveal. Why would they be
liable? The cases say there ought to be
coverage: the exclusions can't be relied on by the title company to eliminate
Schedule B. Whether or not you have a
duty to search, if you do the search and list something in Schedule B, then if
you find it, you must include it there. The idea of title insurance is to provide protection from <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on-record</i> risks. If you find an easement, for example, and
then exclude it anyway, you've basically eviscerated the policy.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Most residential transactions

discover. There are lots of bad things
that could potentially happen, but in practice, the system seems to work very
well without lawyers. So Braunstein
thinks it doesn't make much sense to have lawyers involved in these highly
routine, standardized residential transactions. If you read the title policy and saw something that you didn't
understand, you might want to get a lawyer involved. But generally, lawyers don't need to be

and mortgagor's right to possess the mortgaged property. These theories of mortgages are sometimes
difficult because it's so ingrained in us that the mortgagor is the one who has
the right to possession. Why would you
buy a house if it meant that a bank employee would be living in it instead of
you? But that's not the way the mortgage
developed. We have different theories
that give different possessory rights to the mortgagee. We know that after foreclosure, the mortgage
is wiped out. Why would the mortgagee
want possession prior to foreclosure? There are a number of reasons: they may want to stop waste or make
repairs, in other words, they want to protect the collateral. If the mortgagor is doing something that the
mortgagee doesn't like, they may want to intervene. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Maybe the property is a rental property and
it's vacant. Similarly, if the mortgagor
is taking the rents and using them for some purpose other than to pay the
mortgage, the mortgagee might want to stop that as well ("intercept" the
rents). The ability to collect the rents
depends on the right to possession.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>How does a mortgagee get

theory state, you can only get possession by a voluntary act of the mortgagor,
or when the mortgagor abandons the property, or when possession is authorized
by the mortgage itself.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>These theories of the
mortgage don't make much difference these days because we use the same sorts of
instruments all throughout the country, and they have the same provisions. These theories may be important in other

tenancy. But mostly, we'll be thinking
about what the mortgage instrument provides rather than what these theories

mortgage is being entered into that will give the mortgagee the right to
possession. But later events can allow
that to happen. The balance of power
changes between the borrower and lender once the borrower has the money. When the borrower needs the money, the law
presumes that they may agree to just about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>anything</i>
in order to get their hands on the money. So the law tries to protect these people due to their perceived lack of
borrowing power. Once the borrower has
the money and the lender wants to get it back, the borrower has the upper
hand. So you can't make an agreement

possession. What happens now? Can the mortgagee get possession now? Nope. You can only get the property sold and get the money. But keep in mind that the (former) mortgagee
could show up at the foreclosure sale and buy the property. In that case, the mortgagee is not entering

mortgagee, it's probably not a very good idea. The mortgagee is delegated a very strict fiduciary duty of
accounting. Any rents or income you
collect that are above the amount owed must be credited to the amount
owed. You must act like a prudent owner,
which may well mean you have to dig into your own pocket to take care of the
property and make it productive. You may
also be liable to third parties in tort. So this is a risky proposition, and there is a cleaner, easier route to
take: the receivership. Finally, the
mortgagee in possession will work just like a foreclosure as far as leases are
concerned. If you want to go into
possession to intercept the rents, but going into possession <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>terminates</i> the leases, then it's not
such a great idea to take possession. Lenders prefer to have a receiver appointed by the court. But there are costs and risks in this case
too. The receivership may be expensive,
and you're not guaranteed a receiver who is competent. But all in all, it's a better alternative
than taking possession.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In commercial mortgages, the
lease obligations of tenants may be more important than the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>value</i> of the real estate. Take a shopping center, for example. Easton and Northland both have buildings and
land and stuff, but Northland is not worth nearly as much as Easton because the
landlord gets paid by having a loan on productive property, that is, by having
enough rent coming in to pay the mortgage. The lender goes into the transaction hoping to get repaid with
interest. If the lender takes
possession, however, the leases get terminated.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What about when a mortgage is
foreclosed? It depends on the relative
priority of the mortgage and the lease. The purchaser at foreclosure gets the title <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>as it existed immediately before the mortgage being foreclosed was
granted</i>. If the lease was entered
into before a mortgage and that mortgage forecloses, then the tenant is still
bound under the lease. But if the lease
came after an earlier mortgage, then the foreclosure of the mortgage will <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>terminate the lease</i>. So if the lease has priority, the tenant has
no right to terminate the lease, and neither does the purchaser at
foreclosure. The tenant must <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>attorn</i></span> to the
foreclosure purchaser, meaning that the tenant must treat the purchaser just
the same as they treated the original landlord.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If the foreclosure is going
to terminate the lease, why does the lender care about the continuation of the
leases anyway? If we represent lenders,
we can protect ourselves up to the moment of foreclosure by having a receiver
appointed instead of going into possession. Why does the lender care what happens after foreclosure? The purchaser at foreclosure is going to pay
more for a productive property with lots of leases, which makes it more likely
the lender will get their debt paid back.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>So if the lease has priority,
we know the legal result. But what if
the mortgage has priority? <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>If the tenant
is a party to the foreclosure, the tenant's lease is terminated. That means that even if the foreclosure
purchase wants to keep the tenant, the tenant can walk away. Also, the tenant can't force the purchaser at
foreclosure to accept the tenant since the lease is terminated. In some states, the mortgagee can
intentionally omit the tenant and keep the lease in effect, or in other words,
pick and choose. If you don't join a
party and they don't have notice, their rights can't be adversely affected. The lawsuit won't have an effect as to
them. So if the lender doesn't join the
tenants they want to keep, their leases will not be terminated. (Come back to this, I'm a little unclear on
it.)</span></p>

a foreclosure, and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> is a purchaser at foreclosure. There is a provision in the lease that says:
"Tenant agrees that this Lease shall be subordinate to any deeds of trust that
may hereafter be placed upon the premises." This is enforceable! The
Recording Acts tell us that "first in time, first in right" is a default
proposition, but you can contract around that any way you wish. What if it says "Any beneficiary, at its
option, may elect to have this Lease superior to its deed of <span class=GramE>trust.</span>" They're saying that the lease is subordinate,
but if the mortgagee wants to undo this, they can do so. You can go into foreclosure with the option
to either keep the lease in existence or not.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Then what happens? </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> buys the property. After some haggling, Fiber Form says they want out. If this lease clause hadn't been present,
Fiber Form's lease would have been senior to the deed of trust and thus would
have had to continue paying rent. But in
this case, Fiber Form wins and gets out of the lease because of the lease
clause. What should </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Saratoga</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> have done prior to foreclosure? What mistake did </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> make? The
clause says that the beneficiary of the deed of trust has the option. But it's not the beneficiary who is trying to
exercise the right, but rather the purchaser at foreclosure. That person doesn't have the right to do it
at all. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Saratoga</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> could have exercised the right to <span class=SpellE>unsubordinate</span>,
but they didn't. What should </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> should have recognized that there was a substantial
likelihood that the lease would be terminated as a result of foreclosure. Before purchasing, they could have gone to
Fiber Form and asked them if they would stay so they would know what the
property was really worth. If they're
valuing the property based on the rents from Fiber Form, they better have a
good idea of what Fiber Form is going to do before they purchase.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The lease is above market
rate (unless there is some problem with Fiber Form). So </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Saratoga</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, the beneficiary of the deed in trust (mortgagee),
should have exercised the option prior to the foreclosure sale. Also, in a "pick-and-choose" state, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Saratoga</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> could have omitted Fiber Form from the foreclosure,
in which case their legal rights would not have been affected. But Fiber Form <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>was</i> joined in the case. What's </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>'s argument with respect to lease rights created <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>after </i>foreclosure? They argue that Fiber Form paid rent, so they
were acting like the lease was still in effect. But the court disagrees, saying that the rent was being paid with
respect to a new, month-to-month tenancy. That means that Fiber Form can get out of it with 30 days notice. It would have been helpful for Fiber Form to
put down their understanding of the lease in writing when they continued to
submit their rent checks.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This deal was structured with
"optional <span class=SpellE>unsubordination</span>". <span class=GramE>It's</span> fine if it
works right, but you could get a problem like we saw in this case. The Restatement says that you can't have a
subordination or <span class=SpellE>unsubordination</span> that "materially
prejudices the person whose interest is advanced in priority without their
consent". Another way the deal could
have been done is with an "<span class=SpellE>attornment</span>" clause in the
lease, saying that the lessee agrees to <span class=SpellE>attorn</span> to the
purchaser at foreclosure and their successors in interest. Finally, you could use a so-called "new
lease" agreement. This is not automatic. But you could have a provision in the lease
that in the event of a foreclosure or transfer, the tenant agrees to execute a
new lease that is identical to the current lease with the subsequent
purchaser. The problem is that it's not
self-executing, so the tenant might not make the new lease. <span class=GramE>Also, what if the tenant <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can't</i> execute the new lease.</span> It might be difficult to get performance of
this future act. From the mortgagee's
perspective, the <span class=SpellE>attornment</span> clause is the most
desirable. The clause must be in the <span
class=GramE>lease,</span> or something else that the tenant has signed. It can't be just in the mortgage.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Leases are pretty important
in the process. How does the mortgagee
preserve a favorable lease that's junior? We know how to get rid of it: join the tenant, and the foreclosure
terminates the lease. If you want to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>keep</i> the lease in a "pick and choose"
state, you can omit the junior tenants from the judicial foreclosure. But in some states, there <span class=GramE>are
power</span> of sale foreclosures. A
power of sale is a right the mortgagor (or the person in the position of the
mortgagor) gives to the trustee to sell the property and apply the proceeds to
satisfy the debt. In a judicial state
like </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>, only the sheriff can execute the foreclosure
sale. In a power of sale state, you can
hold on to your tenant by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> giving
proper notice. As a result, they are
unaffected by the proceeding.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If you're in a state that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>doesn't</i> allow you to pick and choose,
the junior tenants can intervene even if you don't join them in a judicial
foreclosure state. And in a power of
sale state, the tenant is bound anyway. Automatic termination may be better because it allows the parties after
foreclosure to renegotiate the lease more or less on equal footing. The parties can contract around this if they
want. This is an area where the lawyer
plays a number of different roles. The
lawyer is a planner, drawing up leases and mortgages. The lawyer may also be a litigator. The person drafting the instruments must
think about what happens to them in the event of a dispute. The lawyer also plays the role of financial advisor. They advise borrowers as to what terms may
and may not appear in the lease such that they'll be able to get a mortgage
later. Some lease terms may even render
the property <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unmortgageable</i></span>.</span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Lender's evaluation of leases</span></b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>When the lender looks at
leases, the lenders wants to know what the rent is and what it will be in the future. The lender wants to know about the tenant's
financial condition. Are they
creditworthy? The lender is especially
interested in anything that will cost it money, so if the landlord has
financial obligations to the tenant, the lender will want to know about
it. If the landlord is obligated to
rebuild in the event of a casualty loss, the lender will be concerned. If there is an exclusive clause in the lease,
the lender will be concerned because the lender or purchaser at foreclosure may
be in violation immediately upon completion of the sale or mortgage. These clauses say that only a certain number
of similar businesses can be in the same shopping center, for example. The lender is also concerned with assignment
and subletting. The lender wants to have
the same control in the future as a potential landlord as does the current
landlord. One of the most heavily
negotiated clauses is the duty to operate, or operating covenant. Landlords want shopping centers to have
tenants who are operating. It's bad for
the shopping center to have a lot of empty storefronts. It has a cascading effect on the other stores
in the center. The landlord establishes
that the tenant is creditworthy, but the landlord also wants a promise that the
tenant will stay in business. The tenant
will tend to resist this clause.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>When the lender evaluates the
collateral, the income the property is bringing in is the most important factor
to be considered. The lender will impose
on the developer some kind of debt service ratio. The net rents must equal some percentage
greater than the debt service (your monthly payment, principal plus
interest). 120% is not uncommon, and the
riskier the project, the higher the ratio will be. If you have 120% as the ratio, the lender
wants to see operating income that is at least 120% of the amount that must be
paid on the debt. So the lender is
looking at rents and operating expenses. The net operating income is the gross rent minus the expenses of
operating the building. Then you
subtract the debt service and you get your net cash flow. You calculate your debt service ratio by
dividing your net rents before debt service by the debt service itself.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>When lending on a building
that's already there and has existing tenants, the lender requires "estoppel
statements" from the tenants. The
"estoppel certificate" is designed to estop the tenant from denying the truth
of certain facts, even if those facts aren't actually true. The tenants must state that the lease is
valid and binding. The lender wants to
know that the lease that the landlord has looked at and approved is actually
the lease in effect (no modifications have been made). The lender wants to know that the rent is
whatever is stated in the lease. Also,
landlords engage in lots of tricks to make their property look better to
lenders. They know about the debt
service coverage ratio. So if the tenant
can't pay enough, the landlord will sign a side agreement with the tenant
saying that they get every twelfth month free. This is called a rent concession agreement. If the tenant denies that such an agreement
exists, it could be fraud, but the tenant can play it both ways as long as the
tenant isn't deceptive. Prepaid rent is
particularly dangerous: when the landlord is in financial trouble and asks for
a year's rent in advance in exchange for a 25% discount, <span class=GramE>then</span>
the rent may already be in the pocket of the landlord before it gets into the
lender's hands. The lender also wants to
know how large the security deposits are, the term of the lease and renewal
options. Finally, the lender wants to
know that the tenant has no claims against the landlord for breach.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This is known as "SNA". These are the three basic agreements that
adjust the post-foreclosure/post-default relationship between the lender and
the tenant. A <span class=SpellE>nondisturbance</span>
agreement is an agreement by the lender that if the lender or a purchase at
foreclosure comes into possession, that person will not disturb the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tenant's</i> right to possession. The lender promises on behalf of itself and
its heirs and assigns (namely, the purchaser at foreclosure). If the leases are in place when the loan is
made, it may be necessary to have a three-way negotiation
(mortgagor-mortgagee-tenant). If there
are no leases yet, this is just a negotiation between the mortgagee and
mortgagor.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What terms are favorable to
the mortgagee? The mortgagee wants
subordination, that is, that the lease is junior to the mortgage, and also
wants <span class=SpellE>attornment</span>. The mortgagee can kick the tenant out, but the tenant can't decide to
terminate on her own. You can kick the
tenant out because the lease is subordinate, but you can keep the tenant
because the tenant has promised to <span class=SpellE>attorn</span>. Other clauses you can have are the "new
lease" clause or optional "<span class=SpellE>unsubordination</span>".</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>When you have a small tenant,
the deal that the landlord offers them and the mortgagee will try to insist on
is automatic subordination plus a promise to <span class=SpellE>attorn</span>. In the Fiber Form case, only the mortgagee
could exercise the option. It is <span
class=GramE>a stronger clause to have the tenant agree</span> to <span
class=SpellE>attorn</span> to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any person</i>
acquiring the premises.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The tenant would like to only
have a <span class=SpellE>nondisturbance</span> agreement: a promise from the
mortgagee that the mortgagee and purchaser at foreclosure won't kick the tenant
out and terminate the lease even though the relative priorities of the parties
would give them the right to do that. This is the "mirror image" of the <span class=SpellE>attornment</span>
agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In the real world, the
parties will bargain, and depending on the bargaining power of each party, one
side or the other will get their preferred clauses, or the parties are
balanced, you get all three agreements: subordination, <span class=SpellE>nondisturbance</span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> and </i><span class=SpellE>attornment</span>,
which have some benefits to both sides. But why would the lender care about <span class=GramE>a subordination</span>
from the tenant if the lender is going to give the tenant a promise not to
disturb the tenant? If the lender can't
throw the tenant out on foreclosure, why bother to get the tenant to
subordinate? Many states require that
certain kinds of lenders only have first liens. You're required by law if you're a certain kind of company to secure all
or most of your loans with first liens (not second, third etc.). Also, the lease and mortgage may have some
conflicting provisions.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Any subordination agreement
should be recorded. Does the <span
class=SpellE>attornment</span> agreement need to be recorded? Is there a possibility of a good faith
purchaser for value without notice? Yes,
for all three of these agreements. The
rights of third parties could intervene and they won't be bound if they don't
have notice. They don't need to be
recorded necessarily in that they are valid as to people with actual notice of
them and they will probably be discovered without recording from the estoppel
certificate, but they may not be. The
best practice is to record.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are some rights or
obligations that the lender may be unwilling to assume that would be included
in the <span class=SpellE>nondisturbance</span> agreement. But there are some exceptions. The lender or purchaser at foreclosure is
willing to be bound by the lease, but not by things that happened before they
became landlord. They want to have a
clean slate when they take over. You can
include, for example, that the lender isn't bound by modifications to the lease
that occur without the lender's consent.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>So far, we've been talking
about the fact that the lender wants to ensure a stream of income (i.e. rents)
available to repay the loan. How does
the lender get possession of the rents? What priority does the lender have with respect to the rents? The purchaser at foreclosure gets the title
as it was just before it was foreclosed. What about judgment creditors? They may come in first in time with respect to the rents (though not to
the realty). The obligation to pay rent
is treated as if it were part of the real estate. Courts get confused about this: they talk
about both when assignment of rents becomes effective and when it becomes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perfected</i> (which is the language of the
Uniform Commercial Code having to do with security interests in personal
property rather than real property). The
proper way to do it is to talk about rents as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>real </i>property.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are lots of reasons to
want assignment of rents. You might want
to get the rent during a foreclosure proceeding. The foreclosure period may be lengthy. If the mortgagor is getting rent but not
paying the mortgage, it's a problem that assignment of rents can solve. If waste is ongoing, an assignment of rents
will allow the mortgagee to capture the rents and stop the waste. The mortgage on the rent must be drafted to
trigger assignment of the rents upon particular events.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What does "rents" mean? The Restatement defines it pretty broadly:
it's not just payments by lessees, but also licensees and others. The common law would limit rents to payments
made by lessees. A common question is
whether something is rent or not. These
are tough questions under common law, but not under the Restatement. If a payment is made in exchange for the
right to use or possess the property, then it's a rent. There are other things that could be
financial obligations of the tenant that may not be included in the Restatement
definition. A lease may commonly provide
that the tenant is required to help maintain the common areas. You could argue that such payments are not
made for the right to use or occupy the property. If the tenant is required to purchase
insurance, and the landlord is authorized to purchase it on behalf of the
tenant if the tenant doesn't do it, is that a rent? There are a lot of questions remaining. But lenders will insist that in leases, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i> of these things are to be defined as
rents.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We talked about what a rent
is. It's a matter of
classification. But then things get more
confusing. Focus on these three issues:
(1) when does the assignment become effective between the mortgagor and
mortgagee? (2) When does the assignment
become effective (or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>perfected</i>) as
between the mortgagee and third parties? This is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>priority</i>
issue. (3) What must be done to
foreclose on the assignment of rents? In
other words, when does the mortgagee get to actually start collecting the
rents?</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There are three types of
assignments of rents: (1) <span class=GramE>The</span> lender collects all
rents from the beginning of the loan: this is called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>absolute assignment of rents</i>. This is relatively rare. Many
clauses that purport to create this provide that the mortgagor can maintain
possession until something happens. The
lender usually doesn't care to get into the business of managing the property and
collecting rents. You could have just a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sale</i> of the rents, or the right to
collect the rents in a security transaction. (2) The assignment of rents becomes absolute after default. This occurs much more frequently. The language gets confusing: some documents
say this is an absolute assignment of rents, except for the fact that the
mortgagee appoints the mortgagor as an agent who is authorized to receive rents
on the mortgagee's behalf. The mortgagee
actually gets the money, though, until default occurs. (3) The mortgagor gets to keep the rents and
the mortgagee doesn't get actual possession of them until something
happens. This is usually a combination
of default and some other action by the mortgagee.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The purchaser at foreclosure
will get the rents because the purchaser becomes the owner of the
property. The mortgage on the rents is <i

property is gone. But who will get the
rents in the interim between default and foreclosure? That's the issue here.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The actions that can trigger
an assignment include taking possession (but that often terminates the leases
if the leases are junior to the mortgage), bringing an action at law to
"impound" or "sequester" the rents, getting a receiver appointed, making a
written demand on the tenants to give the mortgagee the right to possession of
the rents, or making a written demand on the mortgagor. What if you make a demand on the mortgagor,
but the tenants continue to pay the mortgagor? What is the liability of the tenants? We have a contract between landlord and tenant. The landlord is also the mortgagor. Then you have an assignment of that contract
right to a third party, who is the mortgagee. The assignment becomes effective as against the obligor, the tenant,
when the tenant receives actual notice of the assignment. Even though the assignment is effective just
by giving notice to the mortgagor, you'll still have to do something to
actually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>get</i> the rents. You must give the tenants actual notice; they
are protected until that happens.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The court adopts the
Restatement rule, which provides that the mortgage on rents is effective
against the mortgagor <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> third
parties upon execution and delivery. What else is required to make it effective against third parties? It must be recorded. The Restatement also answers the second
question: when does the mortgagee's right to actually get the rents
accrue? First, whatever conditions <span
class=GramE>that are</span> in the mortgagee must be satisfied: this mortgage
says that the right accrues on default. In addition, notice must be given to the mortgagor and any subordinate
mortgagees. What does that mean in this
case? O'Neal already has some of the
rents. Does Security National get them
back? Security National wins this
case. The court finds that they have a
higher priority than O'Neal. But their
right to possession to the rents isn't going to arise <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

that their mortgage is in default and that they are demanding the rents. It looks like O'Neal will win as to the rents

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>How is a mortgage on rents
"perfected" as against third parties? Rents are real property, so you must record. But some courts and some parties think that
rents are "just money", meaning that you must file a Uniform Commercial Code

something you file with the Secretary of State to give everyone else notice
that you have a lien on someone else's money. The best practice is to file both placesa "belt and suspenders"

"trigger" or "actuate" an assignment of rents? Possession is a sticky business. The best thing is receivership! Why? A receivership is easy to
get. You don't terminate junior
leases. You don't have to have a strict
fiduciary accounting duty. You don't
have tort liability. You can make
repairs, but don't <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>have to</i>. Finally, you can evict delinquent tenants and

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In this case, there are two
mortgages. Someone is embezzling Dart's
money! Western Savings and Inland
Mortgage are both granted mortgages, and both mortgages provide that a receiver
shall be appointed. Both mortgagees want
a receiver appointed, but we're not sure why. They don't get receivers. Why
not? They have security in the rents and
there is no waste of the property. There
was also a federal tax lien of almost $200,000. But the tax lien was junior of the other mortgages, so the purchaser at
foreclosure will take free of the tax lien. So when the court evaluates the collateral as to the two mortgagees,
they're fine. It's not the mortgagees'
problem whether Dart's debts get paid off.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In order to get a receiver
appointed in most jurisdictions, there must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>inadequate security</i>. Some
courts say that the mortgagor must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>insolvent</i>. The idea is that it doesn't matter if the
property isn't enough to secure the debt if the mortgagor has lots of other
assets that could secure the debt. This
makes some sense, but it arguably deprives the mortgagee of just what they
bargained for: being able to rely on the property itself and not the solvency
of the mortgagor. In addition, you
usually must show that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>waste</i> is
threatened. You have to show that you're
being threatened and that you don't have a remedy.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What is inadequate
security? When is security
inadequate? Why was it adequate
here? What does the mortgagee bargain
for? The mortgagee bargains for two
different kinds of "cushions". First,
the mortgagee typically won't loan 100% of the value of the property, but
something less, like 80%, which leaves a 20% cushion. The mortgagee also bargains for the debt
getting paid, meaning that the principal is reduced and the cushion gets bigger
over time. So you could argue that if
the value of the security is less than the lien, then security is
adequate. The other way to argue it is
to say that if the ratio of the amount of the outstanding lien to the value of
the property is greater than originally expected, then the security is
inadequate. The mortgagee typically
expects that the principal will be paid down and the loan, in some sense, will
become more secure as time goes on. The
Restatement takes the view that you bargained for the cushion: not just the
original 20%, but the rest of the cushion built into the amortization of the
mortgage. If the mortgagee isn't where
they expected to be on the amortization curve, then we say that the security is
inadequate.</span></p>

as in § 4.2(2). In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

of the property itself. Not only do you
have to show what you must show to get the rents, but you also have to show
inadequate security, waste, and possibly the insolvency of the mortgagor. An "assignment of rents" or receivership

style='font-size:11.0pt'>. What
happened? Delco was operating the
bowling alley. They borrowed money from
Prudential and then Spencer's buys the property, but doesn't assume the
mortgage. What is an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>assuming</i> versus a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>non-assuming</i> grantee? Say
you have a mortgagor and mortgagee, and the mortgagor is also a grantor, who
transfers to a grantee. The grantee
could assume the mortgage, which is similar to the idea that a tenant can
assume a lease. Assumption is a
third-party beneficiary contract: between the mortgagor and grantee for the
benefit of the mortgagee. The grantee is
then liable not just on the mortgage, but also on the promissory note. That means that if the mortgage goes into
default, the grantee is liable. The
assuming grantee is liable to lose the land, and to the extent that the grantee
paid anything, will also lose her equity. The grantee will be liable for any deficiency created by the fair market
value being less than the amount of the debt outstanding. That is, you must make up the different
between the debt and the proceeds of the foreclosure sale.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>There is another possibility:
taking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subject to</i> as opposed to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>assuming</i>. When you take subject to, the grantee is
perhaps paying something for the land, perhaps just agreeing to take it, but
there is no agreement on the part of the grantee to pay the mortgage. The land is still encumbered by the mortgage,
meaning that the grantee is liable to lose the land and any equity that the
grantee has in the land, but that's the maximum liability the grantee will have
on the note (zero). The grantee has no obligation
to pay the promissory note because the grantee never agreed to do so. This is unfortunate terminology because
people often say: "I'm buying land subject to a mortgage", but what they really
mean to say is that they're buying land <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>encumbered</i>
by a mortgage. They could be assuming or
taking subject to.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In this case, Spencer was a
non-assuming grantee. Prudential is
seeking damages from Spencer. The
outstanding debt was about $1 million, but the property sold for only two-thirds
of that. Prudential wants to recover
more than the $600,000. They claim that
there is a deficiency here. Prudential
could have recovered from Delco because they promised to pay the debt, and the
fact that they transferred it to someone else doesn't relieve them of their
responsibility to pay. But Delco is out
of the picture, possibly bankrupt, so Prudential chooses to go after Spencer
instead.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Prudential claims that
they're not suing for a deficiency, knowing that they can't get a deficiency
against Spencer as a non-assuming grantee. Instead, they sue Spencer for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>waste</i>. Here's what's odd about waste: when we
studied waste in Property, we talked about it as a common pool problem between
two or more people who owns interests in property in common. Future interests are the most basic
example. The common law doctrine of
waste is designed to counteract the incentive that common ownership creates to
use the property up before you have to hand it over to the next guy. If the tenant causes damage to the property,
they have to live with it for a while, but the real cost will be borne by the
landlord when they take the property back. The law of waste is designed to give a remedy for this.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In the mortgage situation,
it's a little different. In a title
theory state, we wouldn't have any problem with waste: we have two people with
an ownership interest in the same property at the same time. But in a lien theory state, the mortgagee has
no ownership interest at all, just a security interest! The court decides that even in lien theory
states, the law of waste protects mortgagees even though they don't own the
property.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Spencer claims that because
they're not an assuming grantee, they're not liable for the deficiency, but
rather their maximum liability is to lose the property (which they did). Prudential says they're liable for waste even
though there is no contract and no assumption. But waste is a tort. You can have
a tort between parties who don't have a contractual relationship! The court is enforcing an obligation created
by law, not by contract. What's the
amount of Spencer's liability? It's the
amount of the deficiency, not the amount of the waste. But why aren't they liable for the whole
amount of the tort damages? Because
Prudential is only entitled to their actual damages (the debt) and they have
already received part of the damages.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What happens to the other
$144,000? The grantee has created a tort
resulting in $444,000 in damages, but only has to pay $300,000. Does this give the grantee an incentive to commit
waste? <span class=GramE>Not exactly.</span> If there had been no waste, such that the
property would have brought $144,000 more than the debt, the grantee would have
gotten that money as equity. The grantee
has the same incentive to preserve their equity as anyone else. If you damage your <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>own </i>property, you bear 100% of the loss.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>We wouldn't have waste if we
had an assuming grantee. So what is the
relationship between the judgment for waste and the deficiency judgment? Why didn't Spencer pay the property
taxes? Maybe Spencer didn't have the
money to pay! Say there is no
waste. What if we had vacant land? Let's say property values in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:11.0pt'>Kenosha</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> fall. When the
mortgage was entered into, the property was worth a lot more than it is
now. Would the non-assuming grantee be
liable for a general economic downturn? There's no tort liability, and the grantee didn't assume liability. With respect to the passive waste, isn't it
at least possible that that's what happened here? Maybe the value of the property went down,
and it was the decline in the market that led to the neglect of the property,
not the neglect of the property that led to the decline in value.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If Spencer had paid the
property taxes and then gone into default on the mortgage earlier, the
deficiency would have been close to the same. Instead of paying the mortgage down during the period that the property
taxes accrued, he chose to prevent foreclosure. So is this really waste, or just a decline in value, which is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exactly</i> what a non-assuming grantee
should <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> be liable for? The deficiency judgment is very closely
related to the concept of waste.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>What are the remedies for
waste? We know you can get damages after
foreclosure. You could also get an
injunction. You may be able to get a
receiver appointed depending on whether the mortgagor was solvent. What can you do prior to foreclosure? Waste may be a default, and thus you may be
able to foreclosure or activate an assignment of rents clause. You can try to get the debt reduced because
the security has been impaired. The
mortgagee might want to keep the mortgage in existence. If you have a solvent mortgagee, you might
sue for damages but not foreclose.</span></p>

Mortgagee-1 makes a loan of $80,000 to Mortgagor, who executes a promissory note
to Mortgagee-1 secured by a mortgage on <span class=SpellE>Blackacre</span>,

Mortgagor, secured by a second mortgage on <span class=SpellE>Blackacre</span>.
During the ensuing five years, Mortgagor makes all scheduled amortization
payments on both loans, reducing the first loan balance to $70,000 and the
second loan balance to $5,000. <span class=SpellE>Blackacre's</span> value
remains at $100,000. Mortgagor then commits waste, reducing <span class=SpellE>Blackacre's</span>
value by $20,000 to $80,000. Since the scheduled loan-to-value ratio on the
first loan at the time of the waste was $70,000 divided by $100,000, or 70
percent, Mortgagee-1 is entitled to a restoration of that loan-to-value ratio.
The value of <span class=SpellE>Blackacre</span> now being reduced to $80,000,
Mortgagee-1's damages recovery should reduce the debt balance to 70 percent of

of $5,000 divided by $30,000, or 16.67 percent. As a result of the waste, the
value available to Mortgagee-2 has been reduced to $80,000 minus the balance
owing on the first mortgage loan. If Mortgagee-1 does not in fact recover for
waste before Mortgagee-2's action for waste must be decided, the balance owing
on the first mortgage loan will still be $70,000, leaving only $10,000 in value

proceeds, assuming that the collateral isn't impaired at the time before the
proceeds are applied. Under the facts of
this case, the security wasn't impaired, but the loan-to-value ratio was
affected. What if the mortgage says that

hold this. The Restatement says that you
can make typical contract arguments about unconscionability or that you can
point to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The overwhelming majority of cases say that
if the mortgagee bargained for the proceeds, the mortgagee gets them. What if the mortgagee is named as an insured
on the policy? The proceeds won't be
paid directly to the mortgagor, but rather will be put into escrow. What can be done with the proceeds? Can they be used to repair and rebuild, or
must they be applied to the mortgage?</span></p>

not be invalidated by acts of the mortgagor which would otherwise invalidate the
policy. Insurance will be paid to the
parties as their interests appear. The
mortgagor's interest may be invalidated if they do something wrong, but the
mortgagee is protected. What if the
mortgagor burns down the property? The
mortgagee wants the proceeds from the insurance. What if the insurer says that arson isn't
covered? What if you have the standard
or union clause? The mortgagee still
gets paid. What if the mortgagor commits
fraud in the mortgage application? No,
that won't affect the mortgagee's insurance. Same thing if the mortgagor manufactures paint thinner on the
property. What if the mortgagor fails to
pay the premium? Usually the policy
provides for some period of notice before the policy is cancelled due to
non-payment. It will invalidate the

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Who is obligated to pay the
mortgage debt? There are two principal
options: the grantee may assume the mortgage debt, in which case we refer to
the grantee as an assuming grantee, or the grantee may take subject to the
mortgage. The "subject to" language isn't
particularly accurate: you're always taking the property "subject to" the
mortgage in that it's encumbered by the mortgage. But we mean something different with this
"subject to" language: we mean that the grantee is a "non-assuming" grantee. The person becomes the owner of the land but
has not assumed any personal obligations as to the repayment of the grantor's
debt.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Basically, the mortgagee has
two remedies against the defaulting mortgagor: one is the right to sue on the
contract (the promissory note). The
other is that the mortgagee can sue to realize on the collateral
(foreclosure). The mortgagee has the
collateral sold and a fund created to pay off the debt.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Will the
assumption/non-assumption decision affect who is expected to make the payments
on the debt? Does it affect how much cash
the grantee will pay for the real estate? The owner of the property will always pay the mortgage. Does it affect how hard the non-assuming
grantee is going to try to make the mortgage payments? The assuming grantee will work harder to keep
the mortgage out of default than the non-assuming grantee.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>It's possible to have a
situation where the grantee doesn't undertake the obligation to repay the
mortgage, but pays the grantor the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>full

selling a very small part of a large tract of land.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If the grantee assumes, is
the mortgagor still personally liable on the debt? Yes, unless the mortgagee does something to
consent to releasing the mortgagor or otherwise changing the mortgagor's
obligations. There is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>nothing </i>that the grantee and mortgager
can do <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>between themselves </i>that will <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>adversely affect the mortgagee</i>. The mortgagee has a contract and security for
that contract and the other two parties can't take it away without his consent.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Does the assumption have to
be expressed, or can you have an implied assumption? It must be expressed with one or two
exceptions (just a couple of states). That doesn't mean that the assumption must be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

assumption? Is consideration required? The answer is almost always yes.</span></p>

indemnification. If the assuming grantee
gets sued, he can't sue the mortgagor for indemnification. If the mortgagor and grantee rescind their
assumption agreement, the mortgagee can only sue on it if he relied on it to

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The secondary mortgage market
started mostly after World War II. There
was a big demand for residential mortgages. There was a big public policy in favor of ownership of single-family
homes. Local banks loan money to
individual mortgagees. But at some
point, they run out of money: it's all loaned out. The federal government created Freddie Mac
and Fannie Mae, which are federally chartered corporations. These act as private companies, but they
operate in the public interest. The FHA
serves as a clearinghouse. When money goes
to the borrower, you get a promissory note and mortgage from the borrower to
the bank. Then the banks turn around and
sell the promissory note and mortgage to the FHA, which pays them for it. Now, the bank has more money with which to
make mortgage loans. The FHA turns
around and sells the notes and mortgages to investors, which could be banks,
insurance companies, or wealthy individuals. Mortgage notes are very safe investments. In the event of a foreclosure, the process
sort of unravels.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>This is a more important
issue currently than transfers by the mortgagor because due on sale clauses are
now enforceable. Will the transfer of
the promissory note alone constitute a transfer of the mortgage? Yeah, that's the only thing that makes sense. Will a transfer of the mortgage alone also
transfer the note? No, even though it
leads to the same absurd situation. But
when the later happens, it was probably an accident. Notes and mortgages are transferred in
different ways. With notes, it depends
on what kind of note it is. If the note
transfers the mortgage, why bother having a separate assignment of the
mortgage? You do it just to have
something that can be recorded. Recordation isn't as important as you might think, but it <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> important. The assignee wants the protection of
recordation, and in order to have that, there must be some written instrument
to record.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Why would you want to
transfer a note with the mortgage that secures it? One reason is that you might just want to
sell it. You might rather have cash than
the note. There are plenty of people out
there who would rather have the promissory note as an investment than
cash. So there's a market there. Or maybe you want to use the promissory note
and mortgage as security for some <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>other </i>debt. The promissory note is an asset you have, and
you can use it as collateral just like any other asset.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Here are the two big issues:
(1) <span class=GramE>Is</span> the collateral assignment <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>perfected</i> under UCC Article 9? Article 9 has nothing to do with the mortgage itself, but it does apply
to creating a security interest in the promissory note. (2) Is the assignee a holder in due
course? That would mean that you're
exempt from certain defenses that the original obligor may have; it's a fairly
desirable status. We need to distinguish
fraud, though. There is garden-variety
fraud, where you basically intentionally lie to get the promissory note. That's a personal defense. The real defense with respect to fraud is
when you sign the promissory note thinking that it's something else. That's called "fraud in the execution". The requirements for a holder in due course
are that the instrument must be negotiable, you must be the holder of the
instrument, you must possess the instrument, and you must exhibit certain
behavior. <span class=GramE>UCC §
3-104(1) deals with negotiability.</span> There is also other stuff.</span></p>

alternative with a non-negotiable note. The holder in due course doctrine only protects against personal

obtained by fraud, or against "latent" equities, that is, <span class=GramE>an

mutual promises the parties have made. That's the actual contract. But a

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The UCC Article 3 says that

assignee is <span class=SpellE>estopped</span> to deny the payment. So there are some protections from this
problem. The best protection is to make
sure the payee is solvent.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Most courts that consider the
issue say that prepayment penalties are part of the bargain. Since you can lock in the loan entirely with
no prepayment at all, then the lesser measure of prepayment with a penalty is
included. If a promissory note is silent
on prepayment, do you have a right to prepay? There is a common law presumption that the lender doesn't have to accept

states allow prepayment of residential mortgage loans <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

language like this in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> promissory
note, and it will be enforceable since the common law rule is only the default
rule. Whatever the state law is,
virtually every residential mortgage uses this form of promissory note or one
that is very similar. Any institutional
lender will want the option to participate in the secondary mortgage
market. That can only be done if the
loan is documented with these forms. In
practice, the common law rule only has applicability to commercial
mortgages. The default rule is tempered
by the courts through interpretation: they bend over backwards to find a
provision in the mortgage that allows prepayment. If the note has the phrase "if not sooner
paid", they will find that to be enough to overcome the default rule.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Lenders have a number of
reasons for prepayment fees and lock-ins. Lenders are concerned about changing interest rates. The lender wants to maximize the return on
its investment. If interest rates are
going down, it's in the lender's interest to keep the mortgage in
existence. It also costs them money to
reinvest or to cover loss from a delay in reinventing. The lender may also have costs of initially
placing the loan that are amortized over the life of the loan. Usually, those costs are covered by "points":
the interest rate will be, for example 5%, but 1-2% will be charged up-front to
cover these initial costs. If a loan is
locked in or requires an extremely high prepayment fee, does that necessarily
mean that the loan won't be prepaid? Not
necessarily. The parties can negotiate
out of the original agreement if that's mutually beneficial.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Let's say that interest rates
fall and the borrower has the desire to repay a high interest rate loan and get
a lower interest rate loan. If the
present value of the lender's loss due to repayment is less than the present
value of the borrower's gain from refinancing, then both parties will benefit
from prepayment at some fee. However,
this situation doesn't make sense: how can the borrower refinance for less than
the lender is willing to <span class=SpellE>reloan</span>? If that's the case, then there is no gain
from exchange. So is the prepayment
penalty an unreasonable restraint on alienation? The Restatement argues that it is not because
there is the possibility of bargain. The
prepayment penalty may be attacked as interest if there is a state usury law
that controls. But in most states, such
laws have been greatly watered down. If
the fee is unconscionably high, the courts will reject it. Also, recall that improper liquidation of
damages can be found to be a penalty. This is judged looking from the perspective of when the contract was
formed and asking whether the parties reasonably estimated their damages. The Bankruptcy Code says that prepayment
penalties will be allowed and will be secured by the mortgage if they are
reasonable.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Should there be a prepayment
penalty when the promissory note contains a due on sale clause? What if the promissory note is silent? Is this a question of interpretation? Is this a default rule that the parties can
contract around, or is this a matter of law? The courts approach this as a matter of interpretation and divining the
parties' intent. The question is whether
it is even a prepayment. What about
cases of fire, casualty, or eminent domain? The insurance company pays. You
can argue that in the event of a prepayment, you have to pay the prepayment fee
no matter what. But it's more
controversial to have the lender say that the borrower can't rebuild even if
they want to.</span></p>

have to do to get out of the obligation is crucial to being able to enforce
it. There is only one mechanism that can
be used to assist with paying off a promissory note. If the obligation is not reducible to
dollars, then you can't determine how to distribute the proceeds of the
foreclosure sale. You can't determine
what the mortgagor should do in order to redeem the property from the
mortgage. Therefore, the obligation must
be measurable in money.</span></p>

standard depending on <span class=GramE>who</span> you are enforcing the

against a third party, there will be a greater degree of certainty as to what
the obligation is than when you're talking about the understanding between the

courts use it this way. If the mortgagor

for example when the mortgagee buys the property at foreclosure, we might say
that the mortgage is gone and the former mortgagee holds a fee simple. But keep in mind the purpose of the

and land price crash at the same time as the big stock market crash 75 years
ago today in 1929. There were a
tremendous amount of foreclosures, which hurt both mortgagors and mortgagees. Farm real estate went down by an amount
comparable to the fall of the stock market. People felt at the time that it was temporary, that is, that the
pre-1929 levels of real estate prices represented their "real" market value,
and that the stock market crash was just a temporary downturn from which there
would be a quick recovery. A lot of the
regulation that we study in this course is a result of the bank failures and
decline of the real estate market in 1929. There was also a move towards title insurance, which was a precursor of

of the equity of redemption. There is a
period after default where there can be an acceleration (assume that there
is). So then you have the equity of
redemption. The mortgagor still has the
right to pay off the mortgage and then own the property unencumbered by
it. How long does that right exist? That equity of redemption exists until it is
foreclosed. Typically, the time at which
it is foreclosed is the foreclosure sale. There is a bit of a delay between the foreclosure auction and the
foreclosure of the equity of redemption because the sale must be confirmed by
the court. This is pretty much
perfunctory, but it does take some time. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span

foreclosure, it is a mere alternative that exists along with judicial
foreclosure. Both involve sales, but one
involves a court proceeding at the courthouse (the judicial sale). The process begins with a lawsuit and
proceeds the same way a regular lawsuit proceeds. Power of sale simply allows the trustee to
advertise for some period of time, and then the property is sold. This typically takes place at the
property. The third and least significant
method of foreclosure is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>strict</i>
foreclosure. For our purposes, there are
only one or two states that still allow this. The problem with strict foreclosure is that it denies the mortgagor the
surplus of the equity that the mortgagor has in the property. Under strict foreclosure, you have no
sale. Default occurs, a lawsuit is commenced,
the order is not an order that the property be offered for sale, <span

property. Is the cost of a judicial

or you can do both. What does it mean to

personal judgment. You execute against
all of the assets of the mortgagor including the mortgaged property. If the mortgagor is solvent, then suing on
the note will get around the deficiency judgment legislation. The legislation is designed to make sure that
the lender evaluates the property so that it's sufficient collateral for the
loan and you don't need a deficiency. Also, foreclosures can have a "domino effect". If you have an economic downturn where people
are out of work and property values are tending lower, deficiency judgments
just aggravate that problem.</span></p>

to bring the deficiency judgment within a certain amount of time. You may need to give a certain kind of
prescribed notice. There is also the
"one action rule", which is a statute that says that there is one and only one
action to realize on an action to recover debt secured by a property. If you sue on the note, you <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>waive</i> the security and thus don't have
the option to proceed against the collateral. If you proceed against the collateral first, then, assuming there aren't
other statutes involved, you have the right after that to seek a deficiency
judgment. But the basic idea is that
we're going to have just one lawsuit.</span></p>

rules. The main substantive rule is that
in some states and under certain circumstances, you can't get a deficiency
judgment. There is also fair value
legislation. The legislature decides
that you'll get the property appraised and determine the fair market
value. The deficiency judgment will be
the difference between the debt and fair market value. The property must sell for some fraction of
the appraised value. "Low ball" bids are
prevented.</span></p>

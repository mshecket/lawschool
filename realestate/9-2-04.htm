<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>We
went over the kinds of payment arrangements you can have with a mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s one more: you don’t have to amortize
the mortgage over the term of the mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You can do smaller payments but then pay off the rest of the total as a
lump sum at the end of the term: a “balloon” or “bullet”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is primarily done when you have seller
financing due to the fact that interest rates are high or the buyer doesn’t
have enough money for the down payment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The seller will finance the purchase price, but will only agree to
finance for five years or so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>When
you start out paying a mortgage, you’re paying mostly interest and little
principal, but then it gradually shifts over the term of the mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each month, the interest is getting smaller
because it’s calculated on the outstanding principal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The interest is calculated each month based
on what you owe at the time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As you pay
less interest, you take the difference and put it into playing for
principal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This makes up the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>amortization curve</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The slope of the curve is relatively flat at
the top: you pay a lot of interest in the first few years and not so much
principal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But near the end, you’re
paying primarily principal rather than interest.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You don’t have a month where you pay more
principal than interest until you get a good ways towards the end of the term.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does this say about refinancing?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People do it all the time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When interest rates go down, people
refinance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But when you refinance, you
move back to the beginning of the curve!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Remember that the interest is tax-deductible, while the principal is
not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you refinance and don’t take cash
out and you keep your payment the same, then you’ll end up better off: you’ll
pay off the loan faster.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you take
money out, you’re even worse off: it’s like you go further back than where you
started!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>There
is a very strong policy (that Braunstein doesn’t understand) in favor of encouraging
people to buy houses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The idea is that
it’s good for people to own houses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
may be good for people to own <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>something</i>,
but why houses in particular?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Historically, it may make sense with World War II veterans needing a
place to live.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We wanted to enhance
their ability to buy houses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can
argue that we overconsume housing: when you compare savings rates in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> to savings rates in other
countries, it’s lower, and one reason is that we invest so much in
housing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We do that, in turn, because
the government subsidizes it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is this
such a great place to invest money as a society?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s sort of a Jeffersonian democracy ideal:
a farmer who owns his own land is a better citizen for being an owner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But why is it so much better to own a house
than to save money or invest in stock?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This policy is reflected in how to make mortgage payments smaller.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>You
can reduce your payments by reducing the amount of principal you borrow.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could also try to get a lower interest
rate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are many programs designed
to reduce interest rates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example,
the state borrows a bunch of money at 3-4% and then reloans it to home buyers
for 4-5%.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The state makes a little money
and the homebuyer gets an interest rate lower than what they would be able to
get on their own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Another
way to make the interest rate lower is to have the Fed fiddle with the interest
rate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The interest rate equals the true
cost of money (an absolutely safe investment, with no inflation, about 2-3%)
plus the inflation risk plus the cost of credit risk.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The federal government may intervene to
reduce the risk of certain loans by insuring them, shifting the credit risk
from the mortgage lender to the federal government.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Note that there have been mortgage devices
created to reduce inflation risk, like ARMs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you can adjust the rate of the mortgage every year based on an index,
then you take less of a risk with respect to inflation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, it doesn’t seem to make sense to pay
extra for a 30 year mortgage when you’re only going to live there for seven
years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Also,
the longer you have to repay the loan, the less you’ll pay every month.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the total cost of the mortgage will
also be greater over the life of the loan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You could also change the amortization rate so that your monthly payment
is lower, but then you have the balloon/bullet coming at you at the end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Structuring the transaction</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>What
options do the parties have in terms of the particular transaction, say a house
for $125,000?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First, you can have a cash
sale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Buyer gives the money, the seller
gives the deed, the buyer records the deed, and that’s it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Second, you could have a cash sale while
paying off an existing mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
seller delivers the deed, the buyer pays the money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the seller goes and uses the cash to pay
off the mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The buyer could get a new
loan and use it to pay cash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The buyer
secures the loan with the deed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
buyer could also take over the seller’s old loan instead of having it paid
off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the old loan was a good deal, the
buyer may want to keep it alive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>You
could also have seller financing, in whole or in part.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The buyer could pay a cash down payment plus
a promissory note and mortgage for the balance in exchange with the deed to the
property (encumbered by the outstanding mortgage).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In that situation, the seller wears two
hats.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller basically is the same
person as the lender to the buyer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
could combine seller financing and taking over an existing mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the buyer doesn’t have enough money for
the down payment, the buyer might take over the existing mortgage and then have
the seller finance the down payment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
buyer could give the seller an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>additional
note </i>and a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>second mortgage</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Second mortgage” refers to the priority with
which the mortgagees get paid off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These
priorities are based on time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Finally,
we have wrapping around an existing mortgage loan.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The terminology isn’t really helpful.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is really a combination of seller
financing and keeping the existing mortgage in effect.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The difference is that the new mortgage is
for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>total amount that’s being lent</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The new, second mortgage will represent the
total purchase price minus whatever cash is paid.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The second mortgage is for the full purchase
price less the down payment instead of the difference between the existing mortgage
and the new mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller has the
advantage of being in control, because the buyer makes a payment that is
sufficient to pay the old mortgage <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i>
the new one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the seller pays the
old lender.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knows</i> if payments aren’t being made and
if a loan is about to go into default.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When the buyer does it, the seller may not find out about a default
until it’s too late to do anything about it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For a wraparound to be beneficial, you must be able to keep the old loan
in effect, and that loan must have a lower interest rate than current market
rates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both of those are highly
problematic in the current environment: wraparounds aren’t important right now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>How
does the seller make money on a wraparound?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The seller is really loaning $110,000 and really getting paid $885 a
month.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What the seller is doing is not
loaning his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>own</i> money: he’s reloaning
the money from the old lender at a higher interest rate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He’s borrowing money from the old lender at a
lower interest rate and then reloaning it at a higher rate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the old loan was at 7% and reloan it at
9%, then you’re making a lot of interest on the “new money”.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The return to the lender is quite high!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the same time, the interest rate paid by
the borrower is below market rate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
borrower and seller do well, but the original lender suffers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lenders will object to this!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They’ll object to any situation where the
buyer takes the property encumbered by an existing loan when rates have gone
up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These were very popular when it was
harder for lenders to enforce “due-on-sale” clauses.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, this kind of financing has become less
popular and valuable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sales price of the condominium was
$44,500.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They made a deal for $7,000 in
cash and $37,500 to be financed in a wraparound mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is an old mortgage to Amfac for
$31,800, $7,000 in cash, and the wrap is $37,500 even though that’s not the new
money being advanced by the seller.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How
much money is the seller actually advancing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He’s advancing $5,700.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it were
a cash sale, he would get $12,700, but in reality, with the loan, he’s only
getting $7,000 cash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the new loan is
only $5,700.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The loan was amortized over
30 years, but due in three years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the
end of the third year, when the mortgage must be paid off, we find some of it
has already been paid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The balance on
the mortgage at the end of the three years will be $36,657.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Payments have been made on the Amfac mortgage,
and the balance of that one will be $30,181.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So the seller gets $6,476 in net cash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Where does the $776 come from?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Amfac mortgage is amortizing more quickly than the new wraparound mortgage.<span

only reduced by $843…the difference is the extra $776.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s a great deal!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s like a 20% return overall, even though
they’re only charging 9%.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

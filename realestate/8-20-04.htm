<p><b><span>When is the commission
earned?</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are lots of ways under the listing agreement in the book. The agent gets a conclusive presumption that
he or she caused the sale! Does there
have to be a sale in order to have a selling price? How could there be a selling price if the
seller removes the property from the market? But there is a selling price listed on the contract. How do we feel about the rules for when the
agent earns the commission? If you’re representing
the seller, you’ll want to change the paragraph about the commission in a
number of ways. If you wanted to make it
clear that the agent only received the commission in the event that the sale
closed, what would you say? What about
the doctrine of preventing performance? If the agent brings in a good offer but you screw it up in some way,
they’ve probably earned their commission. Is it enough to say that the commission is due “at the closing” or “when
the sale closes”? What if the buyer
defaults? Do we protect ourselves by
saying that the commission is payable when the sale closes? Wouldn’t the court just imply a reasonable
time? If the condition that was agreed
upon never occurs, then the court will say that the commission is at a
reasonable time. Thus, you’ve only
really agreed on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>when</i> the commission
gets paid, not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if</i> it gets paid.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are other elements you might want to change. The <span class=GramE>agent want</span> to be protected from being cut
out of the deal by the buyer and seller waiting until the listing expires. So they put language in saying that if you
sell the property to anybody who they introduced you to, even after the six
months is up, they still get the commission. You would want to make the agent notify the seller in writing of
everyone that they think they had introduced you to. Also, it can be negotiated so that it only
applies if there isn’t another agent involved. The rationale is that you shouldn’t have to pay twice.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Drake v. <span
class=SpellE>Hosley</span></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
are more than two people who want to buy property in North Pole, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Alaska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>! So first, Drake signs an exclusive listing
agreement with <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span>. A purchase agreement is signed such that they
are to close within 10 days of getting evidence of clear title. The thing is that Drake owes some money to
his ex-wife. How will that be
handled? Well, he was going to pay off
his ex-wife as soon as the property is sold. Good title is considered at the time of closing. Sometimes you can get good title by using the
proceeds of the sale to pay off any liens on the property. So they get evidence of clear title. Then Drake’s attorney and <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span>
apparently agree to expedite the closing. There’s no closing on April 11<sup>th</sup>, and then on April 12<sup>th</sup>,
Drake sells to another person. Did Drake
really find a buyer between April 11<sup>th</sup> and April 12<sup>th</sup>? No way! Someone probably came and told him they would pay more if he could
weasel his way out of the contract. On
April 12<sup>th</sup>, <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span> tenders performance.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
simplest way to buy property is to pay cash out-of-pocket. One alternative is to borrow the money from
the bank in exchange for the mortgage. To the seller, it’s all the same because they get cash. But it might be hard to find a bank in North
Pole, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Alaska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>! Or maybe
you have bad credit. Maybe the seller
will say: “Okay, I’m the bank!” The buyer
buys a down payment and then agrees to pay the seller in installments. At the end of the day, as far as the buyer is
considered, it’s pretty much the same. But the seller has some cash plus a promissory note secured by the
mortgage to pay the balance.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>Hosley</span></span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> sues for his commission. Does
he get it? Yes! What’s the rule of the case? The commission is earned when the seller
accepts the buyer: the seller is then <span class=SpellE>estopped</span> from
saying that the buyer isn’t suitable. At
that point, the seller becomes obligated to pay the commission. What’s wrong with that rule? What is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Dobbs</i> rule? The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs</i> rule requires <span class=GramE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>performance</i>, that</span> is, closing the
sale in order for the commission to be earned. What’s the public policy here? The
court says that people commonly understand that you don’t pay unless the sale
closes. So they make a new rule there
for </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>New Jersey</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if you want to do business differently? What if the broker wants the commission as soon as a buyer is found and
accepted by the seller? That seems to be
the problem with the rule. Some say that
we want people to be able to contract any way they want. But that’s not the sentiment of the consumer
protection movement. Should we have
freedom of contract, or should consumers be protected from themselves? Other courts who have adopted the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs</i> rule have said that you can waive
it, but it’s kind of like a UCC requirement: you have to give lots of notice to
the seller to assure that they know what they’re getting themselves into.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
happens here? Does it matter what rule
the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span>Alaska</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> court adopted? It doesn’t because performance was still tendered. Thus, the court argues, the buyer attempted
to perform and thus, according to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs</i>,
the seller defaulted. We assume that the
result is that Drake must pay two commissions: one to <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span>
and one to the agent who secured the eventual sale. Did Drake deserve this?</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
was the deal about who <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span> represents? Why did the court care? The court says that Drake’s attorney and <span
class=SpellE>Hosley</span> can’t agree to anything because they both represent
Drake. Whatever <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span>
said, it doesn’t make a difference because the agreement wasn’t between the
buyer and the seller. This is how the
court upholds summary judgment. Does
this make sense? Maybe <span
class=SpellE>Hosley</span> talked to the sellers. You can at least imagine that he did. We don’t get a trial to find out. Maybe <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span>
mediated an agreement. But as a matter
of law, the court finds that <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span> is not an agent
of the purchasers and can’t bind them.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
the court could have dealt with this differently. The contract doesn’t say that time is of the
essence. They could have said that
closing on the 12<sup>th</sup> or the 13<sup>th</sup> is okay. They could have said Drake is a creep who
shouldn’t be able to weasel his way out of paying the commission. But they say that Drake’s attorney, <span
class=SpellE>Wickwire</span>, and <span class=SpellE>Hosley</span> both owe
their allegiance to Drake. Even if the
court adopts <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs</i>, <span
class=SpellE>Hosley</span> still gets his commission. Most states use the old rule. A minority have adopted <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Dobbs</i>. But <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs </i>is the recent trend. <span class=GramE>(CRASH!)</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>A problem on liability for commission</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>“Pursuant
to a non-exclusive listing agreement, O places his property in the hands of B1,
B2 and B3 for sale at $10,000. B1
produces a buyer willing to buy the property for $10,000. Before the contract is signed, B2 produces a
buyer for $11,000. So, O refuses to sign
with B1’s customer and signs with B2’s instead. Thereafter, B2’s customer suffers financial reverses and refuses to go
through with the deal. Thereupon B3
produces a buyer at $9,500. O, disgusted
with the whole thing sells to B3. To
whom does O owe a commission?”</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Under
the traditional rule and under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs</i>,
O will owe a commission to B1. Under the
traditional rule, he owes the commission to B2, but not under <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Dobbs</i>. He owes a commission under either rule to B3 since the sale actually
went through. Does it make a difference
that it’s for less money than he originally wanted to sell it for? He could have held out for his $10,000 and
not owed a commission to B3.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about involuntary sales? What if the property
is taken by eminent domain or foreclosed upon and sold at an auction? Do you have to pay a commission? Say the agent has an exclusive listing. Is there anything in the contract that says
the sale must be voluntary? Nope. We don’t intuitively like the idea of the
seller having to pay a commission when there is an involuntary sale, but that’s
what the contract provides for. Many
cases have held that in the case of involuntary sales the seller owes the commission. That could be one thing you would want to
change if you were an attorney representing the seller.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Who does the broker
represent?</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Typically,
the broker represents the seller. But
the law and reality are totally out of whack. Generally, you call a real estate agent and ask to buy a house. You want them to drive you around and show
you <span class=GramE>places</span>. You
typically think of that person as being <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>your</i>
agent. You’ll ask if there’s anything
wrong with the house. If the agent were
really the agent of the seller, then the agent would say: “I can’t discuss that
with you.” But that’s not the way that
the market works! The agent, as a
factual matter, represents both parties. But as a legal matter, the agent owes a fiduciary duty to the
seller. In litigation, sellers may claim
that agents violated an exclusive loyalty due to the seller. Many states, including </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, have changed the law such
that agents can represent the buyer, the seller, or both. The requirement is that the agent must
deliver a disclosure form, usually at the time the offer is submitted.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>There
is a duty to disclose the agency relationship. There is a duty to disclose material defects. In many states, including </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, there are <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>statutory requirements </i>that the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>seller </i>must disclose material defects. This was pushed for by agents so they could
get off the hook for having to disclosure bad stuff.</span></p>

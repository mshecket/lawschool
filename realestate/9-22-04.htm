<p><b><span>The balance of bargaining
power</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>The Restatement of Mortgages § 4.1(a) sides with the lien theory
states.</span></span><span> § 4.1(b) says that generally mortgages can’t
grant an enforceable right to possession <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in
the future</i> to the mortgagee. Why do
you need both? You can’t make an
agreement at the time the mortgage is being entered into that will give the mortgagee
the right to possession. But later
events can allow that to happen. The
balance of power changes between the borrower and lender once the borrower has
the money. When the borrower needs the
money, the law presumes that they may agree to just about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>anything</i> in order to get their hands on the money. So the law tries to protect these people due
to their perceived lack of borrowing power. Once the borrower has the money and the lender wants to get it back, the
borrower has the upper hand. So you can’t
make an agreement like this at the outset as part of the loan transaction, but
if certain events come up <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>later</i>,
agreements with respect to possession <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>will</i>
be enforced. This is a concept we’ll
come back to again and again: the premise is that borrowers lack bargaining
power at the outset, but <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> once the
transaction is completed.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>Hypotheticals</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
mortgagor gives a mortgage, and is supposed to pay it in 10 equal
installments. After three payments, the mortgagee
discovers that the mortgagor is in financial difficulty and the remaining
payments are unlikely to be made. The mortgagee
sues to obtain possession. What’s the
result? It doesn’t matter if you
discover you’ve made a bad loan. You
have no right to possession <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>until</i>
something happens. So in this case, the mortgagee
will lose. The worry that you won’t get
paid in the future is every mortgagee’s worry to some extent, but it doesn’t
authorize possession.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Now
let’s say that the mortgagor defaults on the fourth payment. The mortgagee forecloses and seeks an order
placing the mortgagee in possession. What happens now? Can the mortgagee
get possession now? Nope. You can only get the property sold and get
the money. But keep in mind that the (former)
mortgagee could show up at the foreclosure sale and buy the property. In that case, the mortgagee is not entering
into possession <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as a mortgagee</i>, but
rather as a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purchaser</i>. In a lien theory state, the mortgagee <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as </i>mortgagee <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>almost never</i> has a right to possession.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
if the mortgage contains a provision that says the mortgagee will get possession
on demand after default, and the mortgagee makes a demand for possession? This is unenforceable under the Restatement.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>But
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>should</i> the mortgagee take possession? Is it advisable? Even if you have a right to possession as a mortgagee,
it’s probably not a very good idea. The mortgagee
is delegated a very strict fiduciary duty of accounting. Any rents or income you collect that are
above the amount owed must be credited to the amount owed. You must act like a prudent owner, which may
well mean you have to dig into your own pocket to take care of the property and
make it productive. You may also be liable
to third parties in tort. So this is a
risky proposition, and there is a cleaner, easier route to take: the
receivership. Finally, the mortgagee in possession
will work just like a foreclosure as far as leases are concerned. If you want to go into possession to
intercept the rents, but going into possession <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>terminates</i> the leases, then it’s not such a great idea to take possession. Lenders prefer to have a receiver appointed
by the court. But there are costs and
risks in this case too. The receivership
may be expensive, and you’re not guaranteed a receiver who is competent. But all in all, it’s a better alternative than
taking possession.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The effect of mortgages on
lease obligations</span></b></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In
commercial mortgages, the lease obligations of tenants may be more <span
class=GramE>important</span> than the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>value</i>
of the real estate. Take a shopping
center, for example. Easton and
Northland both have buildings and land and stuff, but Northland is not worth
nearly as much as Easton because the landlord gets paid by having a loan on
productive property, that is, by having enough rent coming in to pay the mortgage. The lender goes into the transaction hoping
to get repaid with interest. If the
lender takes possession, however, the leases get terminated.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
about when a mortgage is foreclosed? It
depends on the relative priority of the mortgage and the lease. The purchaser at foreclosure gets the title <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as it existed immediately before the mortgage
being foreclosed was granted</i>. If the
lease was entered into before a mortgage and that mortgage forecloses, then the
tenant is still bound under the lease. But if the lease came after an earlier mortgage, then the foreclosure of
the mortgage will <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>terminate the lease</i>. So if the lease has priority, the tenant has
no right to terminate the lease, and neither does the purchaser at foreclosure. The tenant must <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>attorn</i></span> to the foreclosure
purchaser, meaning that the tenant must treat the purchaser just the same as
they treated the original landlord.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>If
the foreclosure is going to terminate the lease, why does the lender care about
the continuation of the leases anyway? If we represent lenders, we can protect ourselves up to the moment of foreclosure
by having a receiver appointed instead of going into possession. Why does the lender care what happens after
foreclosure? The purchaser at
foreclosure is going to pay more for a productive property with lots of leases,
which makes it more likely the lender will get their debt paid back.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So
if the lease has priority, we know the legal result. But what if the mortgage has priority? If the tenant is a party to the foreclosure,
the tenant’s lease is terminated. That
means that even if the foreclosure purchase wants to keep the tenant, the tenant
can walk away. Also, the tenant can’t
force the purchaser at foreclosure to accept the tenant since the lease is
terminated. In some states, the mortgagee
can intentionally omit the tenant and keep the lease in effect, or in other
words, pick and choose. If you don’t
join a party and they don’t have notice, their rights can’t be adversely
affected. The lawsuit won’t have an
effect as to them. So if the lender
doesn’t join the tenants they want to keep, their leases will not be
terminated. (Come back to this, I’m a
little unclear on it.)</span></p>

Fiber Form Products, Inc.</span></i></b></span><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>So </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
  >Old</span></st1:PlaceName><span
 > </span><st1:PlaceType><span
  >Town</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span> leases to Fiber Form. Then there is a deed of trust (same as a mortgage)
from </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span>Old</span></st1:PlaceName><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt'> </span><st1:PlaceType><span>Town</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span> to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Saratoga</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>. Then there is a foreclosure, and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> is a purchaser at
foreclosure. There is a provision in the
lease that says: “Tenant agrees that this Lease shall be subordinate to any
deeds of trust that may hereafter be placed upon the premises.” This is enforceable! The Recording Acts tell us that “first in
time, first in right” is a default proposition, but you can contract around
that any way you wish. What if it says “Any
beneficiary, at its option, may elect to have this Lease superior to its deed
of <span class=GramE>trust.</span>” They’re
saying that the lease is subordinate, but if the mortgagee wants to undo this,
they can do so. You can go into
foreclosure with the option to either keep the lease in existence or not.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Then
what happens? </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> buys the property. After some haggling, Fiber Form says they
want out. If this lease clause hadn’t
been present, Fiber Form’s lease would have been senior to the deed of trust
and thus would have had to continue paying rent. But in this case, Fiber Form wins and gets
out of the lease because of the lease clause. What should </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  '>Saratoga</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> have done prior to
foreclosure? What mistake did </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> make? The clause says that the beneficiary of the
deed of trust has the option. But it’s
not the beneficiary who is trying to exercise the right, but rather the
purchaser at foreclosure. That person
doesn’t have the right to do it at all. </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Saratoga</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> could have exercised the
right to <span class=SpellE>unsubordinate</span>, but they didn’t. What should </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> have done? </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> should have recognized that
there was a substantial likelihood that the lease would be terminated as a
result of foreclosure. Before purchasing,
they could have gone to Fiber Form and asked them if they would stay so they
would know what the property was really worth. If they’re valuing the property based on the rents from Fiber Form, they
better have a good idea of what Fiber Form is going to do before they purchase.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
lease is above market rate (unless there is some problem with Fiber Form). So </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  >Saratoga</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>, the beneficiary of the
deed in trust (mortgagee), should have exercised the option prior to the
foreclosure sale. Also, in a “pick-and-choose”
state, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Saratoga</span></st1:place></st1:City><span> could have omitted Fiber Form from the foreclosure,
in which case their legal rights would not have been affected. But Fiber Form <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>was</i> joined in the case. What’s
</span><st1:City><st1:place><span>Dover</span></st1:place></st1:City><span>’s argument with respect to lease rights created <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>after </i>foreclosure? They argue that Fiber Form paid rent, so they
were acting like the lease was still in effect. But the court disagrees, saying that the rent was being paid with
respect to a new, month-to-month tenancy. That means that Fiber Form can get out of it with 30 days notice. It would have been helpful for Fiber Form to
put down their understanding of the lease in writing when they continued to
submit their rent checks.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
deal was structured with “optional <span class=SpellE>unsubordination</span>”. <span class=GramE>It’s</span> fine if it
works right, but you could get a problem like we saw in this case. The Restatement says that you can’t have a
subordination or <span class=SpellE>unsubordination</span> that “materially
prejudices the person whose interest is advanced in priority without their
consent”. Another way the deal could
have been done is with an “<span class=SpellE>attornment</span>” clause in the
lease, saying that the lessee agrees to <span class=SpellE>attorn</span> to the
purchaser at foreclosure and their successors in interest. Finally, you could use a so-called “new lease”
agreement. This is not automatic. But you could have a provision in the lease
that in the event of a foreclosure or transfer, the tenant agrees to execute a
new lease that is identical to the current lease with the subsequent
purchaser. The problem is that it’s not
self-executing, so the tenant might not make the new lease. <span class=GramE>Also, what if the tenant <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can’t</i> execute the new lease.</span> It might be difficult to get performance of
this future act. From the mortgagee’s
perspective, the <span class=SpellE>attornment</span> clause is the most desirable. The clause must be in the <span class=GramE>lease,</span>
or something else that the tenant has signed. It can’t be just in the mortgage.</span></p>

          >Who gets the fire insurance proceeds if both the mortgage and
          insurance policy are silent? This case holds that the mortgagor gets
          the proceeds, assuming that the collateral isn�t impaired at the time
          before the proceeds are applied. Under the facts of this case, the
          security wasn�t impaired, but the loan-to-value ratio was affected.
          What if the mortgage says that the mortgagee gets the proceeds? Is
          that enforceable? There is a </span

          ><st1:place><span>California</span></st1:place></st1:State
        ><span>
          case that says if the collateral is not impaired, the mortgagor has
          the right to use the money to rebuild. But that�s the only case to
          hold this. The Restatement says that you can make typical contract
          arguments about unconscionability or that you can point to the implied
          covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The overwhelming majority of
          cases say that if the mortgagee bargained for the proceeds, the
          mortgagee gets them. What if the mortgagee is named as an insured on
          the policy? The proceeds won�t be paid directly to the mortgagor, but
          rather will be put into escrow. What can be done with the proceeds?
          Can they be used to repair and rebuild, or must they be applied to the
          mortgage?</span

        <span
          >What are the limits on the mortgagee�s recovery of insurance
          proceeds? The mortgagee never gets more than the amount of the debt.
          Does the mortgagee get the full proceeds, or just enough to put him in
          the same position he would have been in as far as loan-to-value ratio
          if the casualty loss hadn�t happened? I missed the answer.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >In a standard mortgage policy, the insurance as to the mortgagee (not
          affecting the mortgagor) will not be invalidated by acts of the
          mortgagor which would otherwise invalidate the policy. Insurance will
          be paid to the parties as their interests appear. The mortgagor�s
          interest may be invalidated if they do something wrong, but the
          mortgagee is protected. What if the mortgagor burns down the property?
          The mortgagee wants the proceeds from the insurance. What if the
          insurer says that arson isn�t covered? What if you have the standard
          or union clause? The mortgagee still gets paid. What if the mortgagor
          commits fraud in the mortgage application? No, that won�t affect the
          mortgagee�s insurance. Same thing if the mortgagor manufactures paint
          thinner on the property. What if the mortgagor fails to pay the
          premium? Usually the policy provides for some period of notice before
          the policy is cancelled due to non-payment. It will invalidate the
          policy and thus the loss payable or standard loss clause along with
          it.</span

          mortgage, meaning that the proceeds were used to purchase the
          property, which was collateral for the Sigmonds. In this case, the
          court is just changing the default rule.</span

        <span
          >Let�s say that the place burns down. The mortgagee makes a full
          credit bid at the foreclosure sale, not knowing that the place burned
          down! Well, the mortgagee bid for the property as it existed on the
          date of the sale. They may have made a mistake, but they bid the full
          amount of the mortgage, so there�s no mortgage anymore! There�s no
          basis for the mortgagee to collect anything!</span

      <p>
        <span
          >For eminent domain awards, use the Fannie Mae form. In a partial
          taking, the mortgage is reduced by the proceeds times the ratio of the
          pre-taking debt to the pre-taking fair market value. The problem is
          when the condemnation award undervalues the property taken, which
          makes the mortgagee worse off. If the award
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">overvalues</i> the property,
          then the mortgagor will be worse off.</span

          >This is a great, powerful remedy! It allows you to hold someone�s
          feet to the fire. If the vendor sues for specific performance, it
          means that the vendee has to keep prepared to purchase the property
          while the suit is pending. They must keep their financing in line.
          They probably can�t purchase another home during the suit, since most
          people can�t afford to have two of them. In terms of negotiating, the
          ability to get specific performance is very powerful for the vendor,
          just as it is for the vendee. The vendee can essentially force the
          vendor not to sell to anyone else. Anyone who buys would buy subject
          to the pending suit. If the vendee gets specific performance, the
          person who purchases while the suit is on will lose it. Thus, it�s
          hard to sell the property when a suit is going on and specific
          performance is being sought. An aside: �lis pendens� means pending
          litigation. Once a lawsuit is filed and you take advantage of this
          doctrine, then the judgment relates back to the date the lawsuit was
          filed. Sometimes you have to give notice to trigger the doctrine, but
          in </span

          doctrine kicks in. Then changes in title after that date will have no
          effect on the ultimate judgment.</span

        <span
          >There�s this huge condo complex. What�s a condo? You own �from the
          paint inward� in fee simple. From the paint outward, that�s all common
          areas and owned by someone else. So you have some of the advantages of
          ownership combined with some of the advantages of renting. The Boags
          take a pretty strong approach when Mr. Boag gets transferred. Why
          didn�t they try to negotiate something? What does Centex want? They
          want specific performance, or, in the alternative, they want to keep
          the earnest money as liquidated damages.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Why might the vendee be granted specific performance in a case like
          this? All property is considered unique in the eyes of the law. But
          are these units unique? Is that self-evident? Some land may be suited
          to only one purpose or has attributes that make it different from all
          or most other land. But this rationale is not really factually
          supported, in Braunstein�s opinion. It�s much easier for the vendee to
          get specific performance than it is for the vendor. So what if Centex
          had told the Boags that they�re out of luck, and so the Boags sue for
          specific performance? Would the result have been different?</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >At the end of the day, if you order specific performance, what does
          the vendor get? They get money anyway! It�s just that they get a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">different</i> (presumably
          higher) amount of money than they would get with their remedy at law.
          So from the vendee�s perspective, land and money aren�t fungible. But
          the vendor gets money either way. So the uniqueness of land argument
          doesn�t seem to make much sense in this case, and it doesn�t seem to
          make much sense in the general case. Why should the vendor get
          specific performance? How about the idea that it�s only fair that each
          side should have the same remedies? If one person can get it, it seems
          like the other person ought to be able to get it. This argument has
          some force and appeal, but Braunstein doesn�t think it�s a strong
          argument. The court in this case says that it�s enough to have
          mutuality of obligation. They say that as long as the contract is not
          illusory, that is, both parties have
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">obligations</i>, then that�s
          enough in terms of treating the parties
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">fairly</i>. But the method by
          which we enforce those obligations doesn�t necessarily have to be the
          same.</span

        <span
          >The damage remedy may not fully compensate the vendor because there
          are things that are not included, or else it is hard to compute what
          the damages were. It may also be the case that it�s hard to determine
          the market price of the property. The property may be illiquid: maybe
          no one will want to buy it. We might say that when the vendor decides
          to sell, all of the vendor�s risks are bargained away to the vendee.
          When you force the vendor to seek damages, you place those risks back
          on them.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >Cheap property here! The buyer breaches the contract and the seller
          wants damages. What does the buyer say? The seller gets to keep the
          $200 deposit. What�s the seller�s argument? He argues that the damages
          provided for in the agreement aren�t his
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">exclusive</i> remedy. He says
          that if you construe the clause the way the court did, it�s a penalty
          and thus against public policy. That means he gets to sue for his
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">actual</i> damages, not
          liquidated damages as set forth in the contract. The court says the
          liquidated damages clause wasn�t a penalty at all. It will be tough to
          get a liquidated damages clause thrown out for being too low! You�re
          trying to say that it�s a penalty because it�s
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">too low</i>.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >But what if it�s too high? Then it�s probably out. But when is it too
          high? When it�s way out of line with actual damages and you could have
          figured out actual damages ahead of time. You calculate as of the time
          the parties enter into the contract. The thing that
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">actually</i> seems to drive the
          courts is whether you did a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">reasonable</i> pre-estimate of
          what the damages would be if there
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">were</i> a breach. So what�s
          called a penalty seems to depend to a large extent on the custom in
          the community. If a 10% deposit is customary, then a clause that
          requires forfeiture of that deposit will be upheld, but forfeiture of
          a 20% deposit will be held to be against public policy.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Does the court screw this case up? Does the court interpret the
          agreement properly? The court interprets this agreement as an election
          between liquidated damages and specific performance. The property had
          already been sold, so the vendor no longer owned the property.
          Specific performance is no longer possible. Then the court says that
          the only remedy available is liquidated damages. But is that what the
          contract really says? Arguably not. You can enforce an agreement by
          seeking damages, right? It seems to Braunstein that the court kind of
          went off on a tangent. When you bring a suit for damages, you�re
          brining a suit to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">enforce the contract</i>.
          That�s every bit as much an enforcement action, according to
          Braunstein, as is a suit for specific performance. Can�t we interpret
          the contract to mean that the seller gets liquidated damages or else
          can sue for more if the liquidated damages aren�t enough?</span

      <p>
        <span>Here we have (presumably) a bowling alley in </span

          ><st1:place><span>Kenosha</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span
          >. What happened? Delco was operating the bowling alley. They borrowed
          money from Prudential and then Spencer�s buys the property, but
          doesn�t assume the mortgage. What is an
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">assuming</i> versus a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">non-assuming</i> grantee? Say
          you have a mortgagor and mortgagee, and the mortgagor is also a
          grantor, who transfers to a grantee. The grantee could assume the
          mortgage, which is similar to the idea that a tenant can assume a
          lease. Assumption is a third-party beneficiary contract: between the
          mortgagor and grantee for the benefit of the mortgagee. The grantee is
          then liable not just on the mortgage, but also on the promissory note.
          That means that if the mortgage goes into default, the grantee is
          liable. The assuming grantee is liable to lose the land, and to the
          extent that the grantee paid anything, will also lose her equity. The
          grantee will be liable for any deficiency created by the fair market
          value being less than the amount of the debt outstanding. That is, you
          must make up the different between the debt and the proceeds of the
          foreclosure sale.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >There is another possibility: taking
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">subject to</i> as opposed to
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">assuming</i>. When you take
          subject to, the grantee is perhaps paying something for the land,
          perhaps just agreeing to take it, but there is no agreement on the
          part of the grantee to pay the mortgage. The land is still encumbered
          by the mortgage, meaning that the grantee is liable to lose the land
          and any equity that the grantee has in the land, but that�s the
          maximum liability the grantee will have on the note (zero). The
          grantee has no obligation to pay the promissory note because the
          grantee never agreed to do so. This is unfortunate terminology because
          people often say: �I�m buying land subject to a mortgage�, but what
          they really mean to say is that they�re buying land
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">encumbered</i> by a mortgage.
          They could be assuming or taking subject to.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In this case, Spencer was a non-assuming grantee. Prudential is
          seeking damages from Spencer. The outstanding debt was about $1
          million, but the property sold for only two-thirds of that. Prudential
          wants to recover more than the $600,000. They claim that there is a
          deficiency here. Prudential could have recovered from Delco because
          they promised to pay the debt, and the fact that they transferred it
          to someone else doesn�t relieve them of their responsibility to pay.
          But Delco is out of the picture, possibly bankrupt, so Prudential
          chooses to go after Spencer instead.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Prudential claims that they�re not suing for a deficiency, knowing
          that they can�t get a deficiency against Spencer as a non-assuming
          grantee. Instead, they sue Spencer for
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">waste</i>. Here�s what�s odd
          about waste: when we studied waste in Property, we talked about it as
          a common pool problem between two or more people who owns interests in
          property in common. Future interests are the most basic example. The
          common law doctrine of waste is designed to counteract the incentive
          that common ownership creates to use the property up before you have
          to hand it over to the next guy. If the tenant causes damage to the
          property, they have to live with it for a while, but the real cost
          will be borne by the landlord when they take the property back. The
          law of waste is designed to give a remedy for this.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >In the mortgage situation, it�s a little different. In a title theory
          state, we wouldn�t have any problem with waste: we have two people
          with an ownership interest in the same property at the same time. But
          in a lien theory state, the mortgagee has no ownership interest at
          all, just a security interest! The court decides that even in lien
          theory states, the law of waste protects mortgagees even though they
          don�t own the property.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Spencer claims that because they�re not an assuming grantee, they�re
          not liable for the deficiency, but rather their maximum liability is
          to lose the property (which they did). Prudential says they�re liable
          for waste even though there is no contract and no assumption. But
          waste is a tort. You can have a tort between parties who don�t have a
          contractual relationship! The court is enforcing an obligation created
          by law, not by contract. What�s the amount of Spencer�s liability?
          It�s the amount of the deficiency, not the amount of the waste. But
          why aren�t they liable for the whole amount of the tort damages?
          Because Prudential is only entitled to their actual damages (the debt)
          and they have already received part of the damages.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What happens to the other $144,000? The grantee has created a tort
          resulting in $444,000 in damages, but only has to pay $300,000. Does
          this give the grantee an incentive to commit waste?
          <span class="GramE">Not exactly.</span> If there had been no waste,
          such that the property would have brought $144,000 more than the debt,
          the grantee would have gotten that money as equity. The grantee has
          the same incentive to preserve their equity as anyone else. If you
          damage your <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">own </i>property,
          you bear 100% of the loss.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >We wouldn�t have waste if we had an assuming grantee. So what is the
          relationship between the judgment for waste and the deficiency
          judgment? Why didn�t Spencer pay the property taxes? Maybe Spencer
          didn�t have the money to pay! Say there is no waste. What if we had
          vacant land? Let�s say property values in </span
        ><st1:City
          ><st1:place><span>Kenosha</span></st1:place></st1:City
        ><span>
          fall. When the mortgage was entered into, the property was worth a lot
          more than it is now. Would the non-assuming grantee be liable for a
          general economic downturn? There�s no tort liability, and the grantee
          didn�t assume liability. With respect to the passive waste, isn�t it
          at least possible that that�s what happened here? Maybe the value of
          the property went down, and it was the decline in the market that led
          to the neglect of the property, not the neglect of the property that
          led to the decline in value.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If Spencer had paid the property taxes and then gone into default on
          the mortgage earlier, the deficiency would have been close to the
          same. Instead of paying the mortgage down during the period that the
          property taxes accrued, he chose to prevent foreclosure. So is this
          really waste, or just a decline in value, which is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">exactly</i> what a non-assuming
          grantee should <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> be
          liable for? The deficiency judgment is very closely related to the
          concept of waste.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What are the remedies for waste? We know you can get damages after
          foreclosure. You could also get an injunction. You may be able to get
          a receiver appointed depending on whether the mortgagor was solvent.
          What can you do prior to foreclosure? Waste may be a default, and thus
          you may be able to foreclosure or activate an assignment of rents
          clause. You can try to get the debt reduced because the security has
          been impaired. The mortgagee might want to keep the mortgage in
          existence. If you have a solvent mortgagee, you might sue for damages
          but not foreclose.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >�Illustration: 14. Mortgagee-1 makes a loan of $80,000 to Mortgagor,
          who executes a promissory note to Mortgagee-1 secured by a mortgage on
          <span class="SpellE">Blackacre</span>, which has a value of $100,000.
          Mortgagee-2 then makes a loan of $10,000 to Mortgagor, secured by a
          second mortgage on <span class="SpellE">Blackacre</span>. During the
          ensuing five years, Mortgagor makes all scheduled amortization
          payments on both loans, reducing the first loan balance to $70,000 and
          the second loan balance to $5,000.
          <span class="SpellE">Blackacre's</span> value remains at $100,000.
          Mortgagor then commits waste, reducing
          <span class="SpellE">Blackacre's</span> value by $20,000 to $80,000.
          Since the scheduled loan-to-value ratio on the first loan at the time
          of the waste was $70,000 divided by $100,000, or 70 percent,
          Mortgagee-1 is entitled to a restoration of that loan-to-value ratio.
          The value of <span class="SpellE">Blackacre</span> now being reduced
          to $80,000, Mortgagee-1's damages recovery should reduce the debt
          balance to 70 percent of $80,000, or $56,000. Mortgagee-1 may recover
          (and upon recovery must credit against the debt balance) damages of
          $70,000 minus $56,000, or $14,000.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >�The real estate value available to Mortgagee-2 at the time of the
          waste was scheduled to be $100,000 minus $70,000, or $30,000, giving
          Mortgagee-2 a scheduled loan-to-value ratio of $5,000 divided by
          $30,000, or 16.67 percent. As a result of the waste, the value
          available to Mortgagee-2 has been reduced to $80,000 minus the balance
          owing on the first mortgage loan. If Mortgagee-1 does not in fact
          recover for waste before Mortgagee-2's action for waste must be
          decided, the balance owing on the first mortgage loan will still be
          $70,000, leaving only $10,000 in value available for Mortgagee-2.
          Hence, Mortgagee-2 can recover damages in an amount necessary to
          restore Mortgagee-2's loan-to-value ratio to 16.67 percent of $10,000,
          or $1,667. Mortgagee-2 may recover (and upon recovery must credit
          against the debt balance) damages of $5,000 minus $1,667, or
          $3,333.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >�However, if Mortgagee-1 actually recovers $14,000 from Mortgagor in
          a waste action before Mortgagee-2's action for waste must be decided,
          Mortgagee-1's recovery will, as noted above, reduce the balance owing
          on the first mortgage to $56,000. In this situation the value
          available to Mortgagee-2 will have been reduced to $80,000 minus
          $56,000, or $24,000. Mortgagee-2 can recover damages in an amount
          necessary to restore Mortgagee-2's loan-to-value ratio to 16.67
          percent of $24,000, or $4,000. Mortgagee-2 may recover (and upon
          recovery must credit against the debt balance) damages of $5,000 minus
          $4,000, or $1,000.� REST 3d PROP-MORT � 4.6</span

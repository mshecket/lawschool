<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Here
we have (presumably) a bowling alley in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Kenosha</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What happened?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Delco was operating the bowling alley.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They borrowed money from Prudential and then
Spencer’s buys the property, but doesn’t assume the mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What is an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>assuming</i> versus a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>non-assuming</i>
grantee?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say you have a mortgagor and mortgagee,
and the mortgagor is also a grantor, who transfers to a grantee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The grantee could assume the mortgage, which
is similar to the idea that a tenant can assume a lease.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Assumption is a third-party beneficiary contract:
between the mortgagor and grantee for the benefit of the mortgagee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The grantee is then liable not just on the mortgage,
but also on the promissory note.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
means that if the mortgage goes into default, the grantee is liable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The assuming grantee is liable to lose the
land, and to the extent that the grantee paid anything, will also lose her
equity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The grantee will be liable for
any deficiency created by the fair market value being less than the amount of
the debt outstanding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is, you must
make up the different between the debt and the proceeds of the foreclosure
sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>There
is another possibility: taking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subject to</i>
as opposed to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>assuming</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you take subject to, the grantee is
perhaps paying something for the land, perhaps just agreeing to take it, but
there is no agreement on the part of the grantee to pay the mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The land is still encumbered by the mortgage,
meaning that the grantee is liable to lose the land and any equity that the grantee
has in the land, but that’s the maximum liability the grantee will have on the
note (zero).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The grantee has no
obligation to pay the promissory note because the grantee never agreed to do
so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is unfortunate terminology
because people often say: “I’m buying land subject to a mortgage”, but what
they really mean to say is that they’re buying land <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>encumbered</i> by a mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They could be assuming or taking subject to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>In
this case, Spencer was a non-assuming grantee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Prudential is seeking damages from Spencer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The outstanding debt was about $1 million,
but the property sold for only two-thirds of that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Prudential wants to recover more than the
$600,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They claim that there is a
deficiency here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Prudential could have
recovered from Delco because they promised to pay the debt, and the fact that
they transferred it to someone else doesn’t relieve them of their
responsibility to pay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Delco is out
of the picture, possibly bankrupt, so Prudential chooses to go after Spencer
instead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Prudential
claims that they’re not suing for a deficiency, knowing that they can’t get a
deficiency against Spencer as a non-assuming grantee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead, they sue Spencer for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>waste</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Here’s what’s odd about waste: when we studied waste in Property, we
talked about it as a common pool problem between two or more people who owns interests
in property in common.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Future interests
are the most basic example.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The common
law doctrine of waste is designed to counteract the incentive that common
ownership creates to use the property up before you have to hand it over to the
next guy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the tenant causes damage to
the property, they have to live with it for a while, but the real cost will be borne
by the landlord when they take the property back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The law of waste is designed to give a remedy
for this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>In
the mortgage situation, it’s a little different.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a title theory state, we wouldn’t have any
problem with waste: we have two people with an ownership interest in the same property
at the same time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But in a lien theory
state, the mortgagee has no ownership interest at all, just a security interest!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court decides that even in lien theory
states, the law of waste protects mortgagees even though they don’t own the property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Spencer
claims that because they’re not an assuming grantee, they’re not liable for the
deficiency, but rather their maximum liability is to lose the property (which
they did).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Prudential says they’re liable
for waste even though there is no contract and no assumption.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But waste is a tort.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can have a tort between parties who don’t
have a contractual relationship!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court
is enforcing an obligation created by law, not by contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What’s the amount of Spencer’s liability?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s the amount of the deficiency, not the
amount of the waste.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But why aren’t they
liable for the whole amount of the tort damages?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because Prudential is only entitled to their
actual damages (the debt) and they have already received part of the damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>What
happens to the other $144,000?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The grantee
has created a tort resulting in $444,000 in damages, but only has to pay
$300,000.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does this give the grantee an
incentive to commit waste?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>Not exactly.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If there
had been no waste, such that the property would have brought $144,000 more than
the debt, the grantee would have gotten that money as equity.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The grantee has the same incentive to
preserve their equity as anyone else.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
you damage your <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>own </i>property, you
bear 100% of the loss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>We wouldn’t
have waste if we had an assuming grantee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So what is the relationship between the judgment for waste and the
deficiency judgment?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why didn’t Spencer
pay the property taxes?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe Spencer
didn’t have the money to pay!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Say there
is no waste.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if we had vacant
land?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let’s say property values in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Kenosha</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> fall.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the mortgage was entered into, the property
was worth a lot more than it is now.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Would the non-assuming grantee be liable for a general economic
downturn?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s no tort liability, and
the grantee didn’t assume liability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With
respect to the passive waste, isn’t it at least possible that that’s what
happened here?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe the value of the property
went down, and it was the decline in the market that led to the neglect of the property,
not the neglect of the property that led to the decline in value.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>If
Spencer had paid the property taxes and then gone into default on the mortgage
earlier, the deficiency would have been close to the same.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead of paying the mortgage down during
the period that the property taxes accrued, he chose to prevent foreclosure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So is this really waste, or just a decline in
value, which is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exactly</i> what a
non-assuming grantee should <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> be liable
for?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The deficiency judgment is very
closely related to the concept of waste.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>What
are the remedies for waste?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We know you
can get damages after foreclosure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
could also get an injunction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You may be
able to get a receiver appointed depending on whether the mortgagor was
solvent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What can you do prior to
foreclosure?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Waste may be a default, and
thus you may be able to foreclosure or activate an assignment of rents clause.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can try to get the debt reduced because
the security has been impaired.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The mortgagee
might want to keep the mortgage in existence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If you have a solvent mortgagee, you might sue for damages but not
foreclose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>“Illustration:
14. Mortgagee-1 makes a loan of $80,000 to Mortgagor, who executes a promissory
note to Mortgagee-1 secured by a mortgage on <span class=SpellE>Blackacre</span>,
which has a value of $100,000. Mortgagee-2 then makes a loan of $10,000 to
Mortgagor, secured by a second mortgage on <span class=SpellE>Blackacre</span>.
During the ensuing five years, Mortgagor makes all scheduled amortization
payments on both loans, reducing the first loan balance to $70,000 and the
second loan balance to $5,000. <span class=SpellE>Blackacre's</span> value
remains at $100,000. Mortgagor then commits waste, reducing <span class=SpellE>Blackacre's</span>
value by $20,000 to $80,000. Since the scheduled loan-to-value ratio on the
first loan at the time of the waste was $70,000 divided by $100,000, or 70
percent, Mortgagee-1 is entitled to a restoration of that loan-to-value ratio.
The value of <span class=SpellE>Blackacre</span> now being reduced to $80,000,
Mortgagee-1's damages recovery should reduce the debt balance to 70 percent of
$80,000, or $56,000. Mortgagee-1 may recover (and upon recovery must credit
against the debt balance) damages of $70,000 minus $56,000, or $14,000.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>“The
real estate value available to Mortgagee-2 at the time of the waste was
scheduled to be $100,000 minus $70,000, or $30,000, giving Mortgagee-2 a
scheduled loan-to-value ratio of $5,000 divided by $30,000, or 16.67 percent.
As a result of the waste, the value available to Mortgagee-2 has been reduced
to $80,000 minus the balance owing on the first mortgage loan. If Mortgagee-1
does not in fact recover for waste before Mortgagee-2's action for waste must
be decided, the balance owing on the first mortgage loan will still be $70,000,
leaving only $10,000 in value available for Mortgagee-2. Hence, Mortgagee-2 can
recover damages in an amount necessary to restore Mortgagee-2's loan-to-value
ratio to 16.67 percent of $10,000, or $1,667. Mortgagee-2 may recover (and upon
recovery must credit against the debt balance) damages of $5,000 minus $1,667,
or $3,333.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>“However,
if Mortgagee-1 actually recovers $14,000 from Mortgagor in a waste action
before Mortgagee-2's action for waste must be decided, Mortgagee-1's recovery
will, as noted above, reduce the balance owing on the first mortgage to
$56,000. In this situation the value available to Mortgagee-2 will have been
reduced to $80,000 minus $56,000, or $24,000. Mortgagee-2 can recover damages
in an amount necessary to restore Mortgagee-2's loan-to-value ratio to 16.67
percent of $24,000, or $4,000. Mortgagee-2 may recover (and upon recovery must
credit against the debt balance) damages of $5,000 minus $4,000, or $1,000.”<span

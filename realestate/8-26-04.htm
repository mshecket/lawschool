<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>We
left off talking about part performance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We mentioned the three traditional elements listed as part performance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But only the first one is really <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>performance</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The part performance in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Roundy v. <span class=SpellE>Waner</span></i> was that the <span
class=SpellE>Waners</span> had made improvements to the property, made some
payments, and perhaps taken possession.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Did
the <span class=SpellE>Roundys</span> ever really intend to sell the property?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why do we give specific performance?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s kind of an anomaly, at least if the
intent is to prevent unjust enrichment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Also, did Mr. Roundy agree to any of this stuff?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems like only Mrs. Roundy was in on it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How does the husband lose <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>his</i> interest in the house, unless Mrs.
Roundy is his agent?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Braunstein
has two problems with this case: (1) where you have a family or neighbor
relationship, it may seem inappropriate to demand <span class=GramE>a writing</span>
in the way you would in a commercial transaction.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That may justify some exceptions to the statute
of frauds in those kinds of transactions, although that’s not what the court
talks about.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(2) The judges seem
confident that there was a contract made, but was there one really?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Did the parties contemplate the consequences
of a contract?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Wherever you have an
exception to the statute of frauds based on acts, you must remember that acts
are inherently ambiguous.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You never
really know exactly why people do what they do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Can
a vendor use the part performance doctrine to enforce an oral contract against a
purchaser?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <span class=SpellE>Waners</span>
paid some money and made some improvements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Is that enough to set up an estoppel against them?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they’re willing to walk away from the
deal, is there any sense in which they’ve been unjustly enriched?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not really.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There’s no basis for equitably <span class=SpellE>estopping</span> the <span
class=SpellE>Waners</span> from denying the contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they want to deny it, you can argue that
they should be able to.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could you prove
acts of reliance on behalf of the vendor?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In this particular case, it looks like it only goes one way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if you use the evidentiary theory of part
performance?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Wouldn’t you have to say
yes?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Aren’t the <span class=SpellE>Waners</span>’
acts pretty good evidence that there was a contract?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Isn’t it evidence that’s as good as <span
class=GramE>a writing</span>?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So it
depends on which theory you hang your hat on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We ask: “Do we have evidence that’s as good as <span class=GramE>a
writing</span>?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the answer is yes,
we enforce the contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>There
are also other acts that could potentially constitute part performance, but
they’re just not mentioned as often.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Lots of acts could satisfy either the evidentiary or unjust enrichment
rationale that would lead you to conclude that there’s a contract.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Braunstein is persuaded by these three acts
because in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
  mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>, they didn’t like deeds,
partly because many of them couldn’t read, but also because they liked livery
of seisin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These part performance
factors are similar to livery of seisin in many ways.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Historians have argued that the statute of
frauds, even at the time it was passed, contemplated these kinds of
exceptions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These exceptions appear in
the cases almost as soon as the statute of frauds was passed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>In
the end, Braunstein thinks we should get rid of the statute of frauds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we enforce it, we’re frustrating the
intention of the parties.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We if say
there was a contract but it’s not enforceable because it doesn’t meet the
formal requirement of a writing, then we frustrate the parties’ intentions
because we think it’s very important for the parties to put their agreement in
writing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Braunstein thinks that there
are enough reasons to put agreements in writing such that we won’t cause any contracts
that were previously written to be oral.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s debatable whether the statute of frauds adds anything; but we <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>know</i> it subtracts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re going to have the statute of frauds,
why have the part performance exception at all, then?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you’re going to have it, why not just say “we
have the statute of frauds and will enforce it”?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The law is of two minds on the statute of
frauds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Buyer’s remedies</span></b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Buyer’s
remedies and seller’s remedies are basically mirror images of each other.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That seems logical: in the event of a breach
they should have essentially the same remedies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The buyer’s first remedy is specific performance, which means requiring
the parties to do whatever they agreed to do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The essential requirement for specific performance is that the buyer
cannot be in breach of the contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As
long as the buyer has performed all the buyer’s obligations under the contract
and as long as the seller is capable of conveying the property under the contract,
specific performance will be awarded.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But what if the seller has sold to someone else who is a good faith
purchaser for value without notice?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
that point, the seller no longer owns the property and can’t convey it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The person who owes the seller isn’t
obligated to convey it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the seller
says: “I promise to sell you my 100-acre farm”, and it turns out that the farm
is only 47 acres, then there’s no specific performance (except specific
performance with abatement, about which more later) because they can’t legally
convey what they promised to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
next remedy is damages: the benefit of the bargain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That means, for the buyer, the market price (on
the date the closing should have occurred) minus the contract price.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That usually won’t yield much money because fair
market value is just what a willing buyer and seller will agree to when
reasonably well informed and not under compulsion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Compensatory damages are unlikely to lead to
a large recovery except in exception circumstances.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we’re talking about marketing contracts,
it’s unlikely that there will be a big fluctuation in the value of the property
during the short life of the contract.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>These damages are also difficult to ascertain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The market price and date of breach will
require expert testimony because you must bring in an appraiser to say that the
buyer had a really good deal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Opinion
testimony is less reliable than evidence from an actual market transaction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Next
up, we have unilateral rescission with restitution.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This isn’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>mutual</i> rescission.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead,
the breach gives the buyer the choice to declare the contract at an end.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The buyer would be entitled to recover
whatever earnest money deposit had been made, with interest, and out-of-pocket
costs specifically related to the transaction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But the damages are always limited by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Hadley v. Baxendale</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
costs reasonably within the contemplation of the parties and that are
site-specific should be recoverable as a result of rescission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
hardest and least important remedy is foreclosure of the vendee’s lien.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This exists only in some states.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The vendee has parted with money.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the meantime, the vendor not only breaches,
but goes bankrupt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How does the vendee
get the money back from the vendor?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
vendee’s lien is a way to get the deposit back by having the property
sold.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only time this has any
relevance is when you have bankruptcy or insolvency.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Otherwise, you just get a judgment against the
vendor and go through the usual process to have the judgment enforced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Sellers
are traditionally also entitled to specific performance under certain
circumstances.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the buyer, money damages
are exactly the opposite.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We assume a
rising market and subtract the contract price minus the market price.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The seller can also unilaterally rescind and
retain the deposit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we talk about
these remedies as being comparable, is it really true that this is similar to
the rescission right that the buyer has?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Who ends up better off as a result of rescission?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does the buyer get?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They only get back their own earnest
money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if the seller rescinds, the
seller gets the buyer’s earnest money!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The seller’s right of rescission is actually much better than the buyer’s
right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>What
if the deposit is greater than actual damages or there are no damages?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if the <span class=GramE>value of the property
has increased, but for some reason</span> the buyer has decided not to go
through with the deal anyway?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Does the
seller still get to keep the deposit?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
wouldn’t seem fair for them to, but they get to keep the deposit anyway.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This does strike Braunstein as unfair.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He would try to write the contract to change
the remedies if possible to put the buyer and seller on an equal footing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He also thinks that the seller shouldn’t get
to keep the buyer’s deposit if the seller wasn’t injured.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only potential benefit is that you don’t
have to go through a whole trial if the seller just wants to keep the deposit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That doesn’t necessarily mean that if you’re
a buyer with a small deposit that you can walk away from the deal for cheap:
you must check your contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
seller also has a vendor lien.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This may
have no practical importance, though it has some theoretical importance,
especially when it comes to equitable conversion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When you enter a deal, the seller has legal <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and</i> equitable title.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But once you enter into a contract, the buyer
has equitable title and the seller has only “bare” legal title.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the buyer breaches, you have a situation
where the equitable title is still in the buyer and there needs to be some way
to reclaim it and get it back to the seller.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The foreclosure of the vendor’s lien is the way that it’s done.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Braunstein doesn’t know of any circumstance
where this would actually come up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is the measure of damages when the vendor is unable to convey because his title
is not marketable?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was this an
intentional or unintentional breach of contract?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Braunstein says that it’s irrelevant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The English rule, followed by about half of
American jurisdictions, is that even though you’re entitled to benefit of the
bargain damages generally, you’re not entitled to such damages in this one
area.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How come?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How do we justify this?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You might have a bad title for reasons you
don’t appreciate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe you gave someone
an easement, servitude, or real covenant that rendered your title unmarketable,
but you didn’t really understand that this was happening.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The idea is that if people don’t get it, you
shouldn’t punish them for it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

bargain damages in this situation, just like all others. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>What’s the rationale for this?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The idea is that title searches are a lot
easier now than they were in the past.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But it’s still inefficient to have two of them done rather than
one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The recovery on warranties is restitution:
you don’t get benefit of the bargain damages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One advantage of the English rule is that it treats the pre-deed and
post-deed situations the same way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
problem with warranties of title is that they last a very long time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The contract will last a short period of time
and damages are knowable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The odds of an
astronomical change in property value are very slight.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Warranties of title are considered real
covenants and pass from one purchaser to the next.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If these warranties allowed benefit of the
bargain damages, the liabilities would become <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>entirely</i> unknowable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
American rule seems preferable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
difference is nominal damages versus benefit of the bargain damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The
court points out that this is a default rule only, meaning that the parties can
contract around it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There’s no public
policy here; it’s just a matter of how the court will interpret the agreement
if the parties don’t specific otherwise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Who has the burden of brining up the issue in negotiations?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court says that the seller has this
burden if the seller wants to be protected in the event that he doesn’t have
marketable title.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since the seller knows
best about his own title, you can make a strong argument that this is where the
burden ought to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>What
about compensatory damages for the vendee?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It’s usually the difference between the market price and contract price
on the date of breach.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With respect to
the buyer, that rule makes sense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
when it comes to the seller, the rule about the date on which you fix damages
is more problematic.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The court says that
it may not always be measured that way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When you have a buyer who has turned around and resold the property, the
damages may be measured by actual lost profits.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The damages may also include lost opportunities, particularly
improvements made by the vendee while in possession.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That’s a pretty open-ended contingent liability
for the vendor as well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does the court
do with the interest rate here?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rates
were high and rising rapidly when this case was decided.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was 1982.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was expensive to borrow because lenders pay out <span class=SpellE>uninflated</span>

last paragraph of this case says that what you have to do is not look at just
the value of the house, but also the value of the house with the added benefit

      <p>
        <span
          >Who is obligated to pay the mortgage debt? There are two principal
          options: the grantee may assume the mortgage debt, in which case we
          refer to the grantee as an assuming grantee, or the grantee may take
          subject to the mortgage. The �subject to� language isn�t particularly
          accurate: you�re always taking the property �subject to� the mortgage
          in that it�s encumbered by the mortgage. But we mean something
          different with this �subject to� language: we mean that the grantee is
          a �non-assuming� grantee. The person becomes the owner of the land but
          has not assumed any personal obligations as to the repayment of the
          grantor�s debt.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Basically, the mortgagee has two remedies against the defaulting
          mortgagor: one is the right to sue on the contract (the promissory
          note). The other is that the mortgagee can sue to realize on the
          collateral (foreclosure). The mortgagee has the collateral sold and a
          fund created to pay off the debt.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Will the assumption/non-assumption decision affect who is expected to
          make the payments on the debt? Does it affect how much cash the
          grantee will pay for the real estate? The owner of the property will
          always pay the mortgage. Does it affect how hard the non-assuming
          grantee is going to try to make the mortgage payments? The assuming
          grantee will work harder to keep the mortgage out of default than the
          non-assuming grantee.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >It�s possible to have a situation where the grantee doesn�t undertake
          the obligation to repay the mortgage, but pays the grantor the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">full price</i>. This makes
          sense if you�re selling a very small part of a large tract of
          land.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >If the grantee assumes, is the mortgagor still personally liable on
          the debt? Yes, unless the mortgagee does something to consent to
          releasing the mortgagor or otherwise changing the mortgagor�s
          obligations. There is
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">nothing </i>that the grantee
          and mortgager can do
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">between themselves </i>that
          will
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"
            >adversely affect the mortgagee</i
          >. The mortgagee has a contract and security for that contract and the
          other two parties can�t take it away without his consent.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Does the assumption have to be expressed, or can you have an implied
          assumption? It must be expressed with one or two exceptions (just a
          couple of states). That doesn�t mean that the assumption must be
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">clear</i>. How about a parol
          assumption? Is consideration required? The answer is almost always
          yes.</span

      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >The mortgagee can sue the mortgagor on the debt, sue the grantee on
          the debt, foreclosure the mortgage and then sue the mortgagor for
          deficiency, or sue the grantee for any deficiency. If the grantee is a
          non-assuming grantee, his only liability is to lose his equity in the
          real estate.</span

      <p>
        <span
          >An assumption creates an equitable suretyship. The mortgagor is
          secondarily liable. The assuming grantee is primarily liable. The land
          is subject to foreclosure. When we say that a party is secondarily
          liable, we mean that there is another party that owes the first party
          indemnification. If the assuming grantee gets sued, he can�t sue the
          mortgagor for indemnification. If the mortgagor and grantee rescind
          their assumption agreement, the mortgagee can only sue on it if he
          relied on it to his detriment.</span

          seek <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">reimbursement</i> if the
          grantee is personally liable, even if the mortgagor made only a

      <p>
        <span
          >What if you have a non-assuming grantee? Subrogation is available,
          but only as recourse against the land. The essence of reimbursement is
          that it is a
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">personal</i> liability. If the
          grantee was non-assuming (�subject-to�), then there is no
          reimbursement and no exoneration.</span

<p><b><span>Title assurance</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The three types of deeds</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
warranty deed – this contains the five or six warranties that we’ll be talking
about. This one contains the most
promises. You warrant, for example,
against all encumbrances. If there is an
encumbrance, the warranty is breached.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
limited warranty deed – this doesn’t warrant that a predecessor in interest
didn’t mess up the title.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
quitclaim deed – this says, in essence, I’m conveying to you whatever I
own. If I own nothing, you get
nothing. If I own an unencumbered fee
simple, then you get that.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>All
three of these deeds are, in essence, contracts.</span></p>

<p><b><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Warranties of title</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Warranties
of title are just contracts. They’re
only as good as the solvency of the person who makes the warranty. It can be a long time before any defect is
discovered! It could be hard to collect
at the time you find out the title is bad. Also, you don’t really know what the state of the title is. You’re just being promised that the other
person has good title. You don’t get any
evidence of the truth of the promise. The other systems for title assurance give you at least some evidence
that the person who is saying the title is good <span class=GramE>has</span>
actually checked to some degree if that’s the true state of affairs. So warranty titles are a little “flaky”: it’s
a “band-aid”. In most states, including </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, if you call something a “warranty
deed”, all the statutory warranties are automatically included.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, the warranties are listed
at R.C. 5302.06. “The grantor covenants
with the grantee, his heirs, assigns, and successors…” This means that the all of the covenants run with
the land. In some states, the present warranties
don’t run with the land; only future warranties. This statute says that both past <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and </i>future warranties run with the
land. The importance of that is that if
A transfers to B and B transfers to C, there’s a breach, and A’s the one with the
money, you want to be able to sue A. We
don’t want C limited to an action against his immediate predecessor in interest. It is warranted that “he is lawfully seized
in fee simple of the granted premises”.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>It
is warranted that the property is “free and clear from all encumbrances”. What are encumbrances? They’re <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bad
things</i> like mortgages, easements, leases: anything that takes away one of
the sticks out of the bundle of sticks that constitutes a fee simple absolute. The only thing that isn’t considered an
encumbrance is if you own less than you purport to convey in the deed. The most important encumbrance would be a
monetary encumbrance such as a mortgage or judgment lien. It is warranted that “he has good right to
sell and convey the same”. This comes up
in situations involving corporations. Maybe only the president has the power to transfer real estate, but the
deed is signed by the vice-president or secretary.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
grantor also “warrants” the title: this means that it is promised that no one
with a paramount title to the grantor will evict the grantee. The grantor also promises to “defend” the
grantee and his heirs and successors. That’s kind of tricky: if you sue someone to defend your title, you can
sue the grantor for attorney’s fees. But
if you lose, you have to pay your own attorney’s fees.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>General warranty deed</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>You
don’t have to use the form in R.C. 5302.05, but if the legislature gives you a
form that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>will work</i>, why reinvent the
wheel? It’s very short, too. You put in the person’s name, and then their
marital status. Why does the marital
status matter? You want to know who has
to execute the deed. In </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  >Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span>, there are still dower
rights in limited circumstances. If it’s
a married person, the spouse must execute the deed. You include the grantee and their tax mailing
address. You describe the land, which is
often a plat in a subdivision. It could
also be a “metes and bounds” description, where you start at a certain place
and then follow a certain path. You also
mention if there are any restrictions such as encumbrances, reservations,
exceptions, and so on. You also include
a reference to the instrument by which the grantor obtained the property. Also, if you note that the person is married,
you have the spouse release dower rights. The form says that only the signature of the grantor is necessary, but
in fact to get the deed recorded, you must get an acknowledgement in front of a
notary. <span class=GramE>The only way
to be sure that the grantor is really who they say they are by way of the
notary’s <span class=SpellE>gatekeeping</span> function.</span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span>Brown v. <span
class=SpellE>Lober</span></span></i></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
are they claiming as the breach of the covenant here? They thought they had all the coal rights,
but the grantor reserved two-thirds of the rights. They claim that the covenant of warranty has
been breached. The court holds that
there was no constructive eviction. The coal
company searched the title and found there was a reservation of two thirds of
the interest in the coal. The plaintiffs
claim that this constitutes an eviction because the grantor didn’t tell them
about this reservation. But the court
holds that this isn’t an eviction because the plaintiffs weren’t denied possession
of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subsurface</i>. One thing that doesn’t constitute eviction is
the fact that you turned out not to have good title: you must have more than
just that. Was there a breach of the
covenant of seisin? <span class=GramE>Absolutely.</span> They didn’t own it, because the grantor had
reserved two-thirds of the coal. They
lose because the statute of limitations for bringing an action for breach of
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>present</i> covenant had started to
run on the date of the delivery of the deed, which was over ten years ago. This seems like an odd position for the plaintiffs
to be in. They say it’s too late to bring
the action for breach of covenant of seisin, but it’s too early for them to
bring an action for quiet enjoyment.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>This
is an example of a case where it was not prudent to rely on the lender. The surface was enough collateral to rely on
for the loan, and so they didn’t care about the subsurface rights. But once we get past the statute of
limitations on the covenant of seisin, the likelihood of an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>actual</i> eviction based on this title
defect gets increasingly less probable. If they haven’t shown up in ten years, they probably won’t show up at
all. To award damages in a case like
this creates a substantial risk of miscalculation: you might be awarding damages
for a bad thing that’s never going to occur. Why not just live with the uncertainty? In that way, what the court does here makes sense. Say the coal company starts mining the coal,
and then the person owning the outstanding two-thirds interest shows up and
complains. What result then? Would we advise the coal company to start
mining the coal? If the seller has the
means to pay the previous grantor, then they reimburse the person who really
owns the two-thirds. Doesn’t that
require that the person who owns the two-thirds to come forward and claim it? The other reason to start mining the coal is
because the only way that they’re ever going to clear up their title is to
acquire the coal by adverse possession. But in order to possess the coal, you must use it in some way.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
damages would they be entitled to when the true owner comes forward? Can they get the value of the coal? They basically get rescission. In whole or in part, what the grantee will
get as a remedy for the breach of covenants of title is the consideration that
the grantee paid. Basically you just
unwind the transaction. If I bought the
land for $10,000 and it turns out that the grantor didn’t own any of it, I get
the $10,000. If I happened to build a
factory on that land or the value of the land went way up, it’s just too
bad. You don’t get expectation <span
class=GramE>damages,</span> you just get back what you paid. In this case, however, at worst, only a
portion of the land will be lost. The
only defect we know of has to do with the subsurface rights.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Let’s
say the purchase price is $50,000 and the value of two-thirds of the coal is $75,000. How much does the grantee recover from the
grantor? You won’t get more than
rescission, and in fact you’ll get less. You haven’t lost everything; you’ve only lost a portion. Your loss is greater than the consideration
you’ve paid. You would think that in the
case of this partial loss you would get the $50,000 back. What you’re entitled to is some ratio of the
value of the coal relative to the value of the entire property that you
purchased. Let’s say the true value of
the property is $150,000, so you’ve lost 50% of the value of the property. That’s your recovery: you get 50% of the consideration
paid. That’s not a great remedy for
several reasons. You’re not getting back
your entire damages. You’re getting
nothing for improvements made to the land or future appreciation. These breaches of covenant can be outstanding
for a long time. It doesn’t seem fair to
make people bear a contingent liability for a long time for a large and
hard-to-determine amount. So we limit liability
to return of the consideration.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>What
the court does makes sense, but it creates a problem in terms of mining this
coal. They take a risk if they mine it
in that the people who truly own the coal could show up, claim conversion, and
attempt to get punitive damages.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><b><span>The Recording Acts</span></b><span></span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>These
are remedial legislation that <span class=GramE>create</span> an <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>exception</i> to the common law. But they don’t <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>replace </i>the common law. The common
law says “first in time, first in right”. If I sell to <span class=GramE>A</span> on day 1 and B on day 2, A wins
at common law because A bought first. This wasn’t a problem in feudal </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  >England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, but it’s a problem
today. Unless you have some way of
checking title, you have no way of knowing if A sold the property. The presumption is always that the first
transferee wins. The burden switches to
the second transferee to show that there is an exception to the common law
rule, namely, the Recording Acts. These
acts vary a little by state. Typically,
they require that the second transferee be in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>good faith</i>. In order for the
second transferee to win, the second transferee must be innocent. They must not have known about the earlier
transfer.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>The
purpose of the Recording Acts is to protect people who acted in good faith and property
in commerce. The person must say that
they took without notice and for value. The property wasn’t just given to the transferee. Finally, the property right at issue must be
one capable of being recorded. This is
the interplay between the statute of frauds and the Recording Acts. The statute of frauds says that if you will
transfer an interest in real property, it must be in writing. The Recording Acts say that you better record
the writing or else it won’t count. But
there are exceptions to the statute of frauds. In any case where your interest is based on an exception to the statute
of frauds, that is, an interest that can be created without a writing, it’s
also an exception to the Recording Acts, and you revert to common law.</span></p>

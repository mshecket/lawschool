          >Most courts that consider the issue say that prepayment penalties are
          part of the bargain. Since you can lock in the loan entirely with no
          prepayment at all, then the lesser measure of prepayment with a
          penalty is included. If a promissory note is silent on prepayment, do
          you have a right to prepay? There is a common law presumption that the
          lender doesn�t have to accept prepayment. This is the majority rule,
          but this is a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">default</i> rule
          only.</span

          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">don�t</i> have the right to
          prepay. There are a few states that by judicial or legislative action
          have reversed the common law presumption, saying that if the
          promissory note is silent, you
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">do</i> have the right to
          prepay. This is only true in </span

          >. About 20 states allow prepayment of residential mortgage loans
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">only</i>. Also, the standard
          Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac promissory note allows for full or partial
          prepayment without charge. Parties can insert language like this in
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">any</i> promissory note, and it
          will be enforceable since the common law rule is only the default
          rule. Whatever the state law is, virtually every residential mortgage
          uses this form of promissory note or one that is very similar. Any
          institutional lender will want the option to participate in the
          secondary mortgage market. That can only be done if the loan is
          documented with these forms. In practice, the common law rule only has
          applicability to commercial mortgages. The default rule is tempered by
          the courts through interpretation: they bend over backwards to find a
          provision in the mortgage that allows prepayment. If the note has the
          phrase �if not sooner paid�, they will find that to be enough to
          overcome the default rule.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Lenders have a number of reasons for prepayment fees and lock-ins.
          Lenders are concerned about changing interest rates. The lender wants
          to maximize the return on its investment. If interest rates are going
          down, it�s in the lender�s interest to keep the mortgage in existence.
          It also costs them money to reinvest or to cover loss from a delay in
          reinventing. The lender may also have costs of initially placing the
          loan that are amortized over the life of the loan. Usually, those
          costs are covered by �points�: the interest rate will be, for example
          5%, but 1-2% will be charged up-front to cover these initial costs. If
          a loan is locked in or requires an extremely high prepayment fee, does
          that necessarily mean that the loan won�t be prepaid? Not necessarily.
          The parties can negotiate out of the original agreement if that�s
          mutually beneficial.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Let�s say that interest rates fall and the borrower has the desire to
          repay a high interest rate loan and get a lower interest rate loan. If
          the present value of the lender�s loss due to repayment is less than
          the present value of the borrower�s gain from refinancing, then both
          parties will benefit from prepayment at some fee. However, this
          situation doesn�t make sense: how can the borrower refinance for less
          than the lender is willing to <span class="SpellE">reloan</span>? If
          that�s the case, then there is no gain from exchange. So is the
          prepayment penalty an unreasonable restraint on alienation? The
          Restatement argues that it is not because there is the possibility of
          bargain. The prepayment penalty may be attacked as interest if there
          is a state usury law that controls. But in most states, such laws have
          been greatly watered down. If the fee is unconscionably high, the
          courts will reject it. Also, recall that improper liquidation of
          damages can be found to be a penalty. This is judged looking from the
          perspective of when the contract was formed and asking whether the
          parties reasonably estimated their damages. The Bankruptcy Code says
          that prepayment penalties will be allowed and will be secured by the
          mortgage if they are reasonable.</span

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Should there be a prepayment penalty when the promissory note
          contains a due on sale clause? What if the promissory note is silent?
          Is this a question of interpretation? Is this a default rule that the
          parties can contract around, or is this a matter of law? The courts
          approach this as a matter of interpretation and divining the parties�
          intent. The question is whether it is even a prepayment. What about
          cases of fire, casualty, or eminent domain? The insurance company
          pays. You can argue that in the event of a prepayment, you have to pay
          the prepayment fee no matter what. But it�s more controversial to have
          the lender say that the borrower can�t rebuild even if they want
          to.</span

          liquidated damages. They must be reasonable. They are must more likely
          to be reasonable if they are based on the missed payment as opposed to
          the amount of principal outstanding. What was wrong with the late fee
          in this case? What payment was late? A balloon payment for the entire
          outstanding principal was late.</span

          >How do you discharge the mortgage obligation? Knowing what you have
          to do to get out of the obligation is crucial to being able to enforce
          it. There is only one mechanism that can be used to assist with paying
          off a promissory note. If the obligation is not reducible to dollars,
          then you can�t determine how to distribute the proceeds of the
          foreclosure sale. You can�t determine what the mortgagor should do in
          order to redeem the property from the mortgage. Therefore, the
          obligation must be measurable in money.</span

        <span
          >To pay $100,000 is a valid mortgage obligation. That�s an ordinary
          mortgage obligation. But a promissory note can secure a promise to
          construct a house. As long as you can tell with some amount of
          certainty what the house is worth and when it�s supposed to be built,
          <span class="GramE">it�s</span> okay. Note that there is a different
          standard depending on <span class="GramE">who</span> you are enforcing
          the mortgage against. If you are enforcing against a third party,
          there will be a greater degree of certainty as to what the obligation
          is than when you�re talking about the understanding between the
          original two parties. The mortgage obligation could be to obtain
          rezoning of land. What about the purported obligation to support the
          mortgagee for life? Uh�I forgot.</span

        <span
          >The purpose of this doctrine is to simplify title. If someone has a
          life estate and a remainder, they basically have the whole bundle of
          sticks, and we just say that they have the fee simple. That�s what the
          law does. The merger doctrine does not work to modify any substantive
          rights, but sometimes courts use it this way. If the mortgagor and
          mortgagee become the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">same person</i>, for example
          when the mortgagee buys the property at foreclosure, we might say that
          the mortgage is gone and the former mortgagee holds a fee simple. But
          keep in mind the purpose of the doctrine. Sometimes when we say the
          mortgage is extinguished, we modify the substantive rights of the
          parties.</span

<p><span>Write
a cover sheet. Write a question
presented on page “<span class=SpellE>i</span>”. For the table of contents, double intent your
point headings. In that way, you keep
them away from the right-hand margins. Then table of authorities. Every
time you start a new element in the <span class=GramE>roman</span> numeral
pages, you start a new page. <span
class=GramE>Cases, constitution and statutes.</span> <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Then break cases into categories by jurisdiction. “Passim” means throughout. Then it’s the <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>arabic</span></span> numeral pages. Insiders do an internal caption. You repeat the top part of the cover page. You no longer start a new page all the time. There is a conclusion, which is signed. When you submit documents in real life, look
at the local rules. The certificate of
service should say what you did to achieve service. You basically say that you promise you gave
it to your opponent. Then, certificate
of compliance.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Don’t
talk about things that you can’t connect to your main point. Make your connections explicit. Make connections in introductory and
concluding paragraphs.</span></p>

<br/>

<p><span>Help
the reader find the argument and authorities with templates. Use typeface conventions.</span></p>

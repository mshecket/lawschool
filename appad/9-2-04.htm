        <span
          >Due Wednesday morning at 8:30 <span class="GramE">AM</span>. I have
          an extension until half an hour after
          <span class="SpellE">Braunstein�s</span> class ends. But he�s not
          having class that day. But nobody�s going to speak up. Do a private
          memo. Drop a footnote to your adjunct when you�re unsure. Also include
          them when you think you did something good. That will help the adjunct
          help you. This draft doesn�t get a heavy critique. This is mostly
          content-based. Don�t worry about the self-graded draft until next
          week. What about length? In real life, there are page limits. There
          are no page limits.</span

        <span
          >Next week, we�ll talk about self-graded drafts. Bring highlighters.
          You can�t show other students writing. We can talk about the case.
          It�s okay to discuss a particular authority. But don�t, in effect,
          study together. We can look at newspaper articles. No attorney work
          product written for this case. No briefs at any stage. What about
          briefs in other cases? Ask your adjunct.</span

        <span
          >About the criteria sheet: nobody�s perfect. Don�t think that you just
          have to do the things they mark. They won�t mark that much on this
          draft. But they won�t say �don�t touch it<span class="GramE"

      <p>
        <span
          >Four stages of the writing process: (1) maniac, (2) architect, (3)
          carpenter, and (4) judge. You are crazy. Then you draw up a plan. Then
          you might want to amend it. Then you have to build and fill in the
          plan. Finally, you need to look at what you�ve done from the outside.
          Look at which parts are just introductory and which parts you have to
          prove. Use <span class="SpellE">CRExAC</span>. Don�t forget
          explanation. You must fill in the connection between the rule and its
          application. Don�t worry about being boring. You�ll be talking about
          different rules, different explanations, and different
          applications.</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >What�s the source of law for the rule? Is it a statute? Is it common
          law? How will I explain the rule? What authorities will I use? How has
          the rule been applied in the past? Finally, in the application, you�ll
          use different levels of detail on the facts. You�ll make analogies and
          distinctions. �Like the defendant in that case�the defendant here�� or
          �Unlike the defendant in that case�the defendant here��</span
        >
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        <span
          >Ask yourself two things, focusing on the phrase-that-pays. How
          abstract or concrete is the language? How controversial or
          uncontroversial is the phrase in this case? The more abstract and
          controversial, the more time you need to send explaining. If it�s very
          concrete and not controversial, you don�t need to spend much time on
          it, if any.</span

          and how they fit together. Connect the concepts for the reader. It

          interpretation issue? I <span class="SpellE">dunno</span>. If you do,
          then remember that the facts may be the language of the statute you�re

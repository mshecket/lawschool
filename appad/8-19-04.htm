          >We only have three drafts and we don�t have to start from scratch on
          our research. We have lower court decisions that we can look at and we
          can get our research started from those decisions. All the homework
          will be parts of doing the writing. There are due dates that all occur
          at once. Be decent on the day the paper is due. We only have 10
          meetings. You�re done with the class by Thanksgiving. 80% of the grade
          is the brief, 20% for oral argument. That�s a big difference. Judges
          in real life care more about briefs than oral argument. The brief
          tends to form a <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span> presumption
          that gets tested at oral argument. The goal is to come up with a brief
          that doesn�t <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">need</i> oral
          argument. If you do <span class="GramE">bad</span> on the drafts, you
          lose points on the final grade. But you want to learn stuff from the
          drafts. There are 18 adjunct sections.</span

          >You are not allowed to look at any attorney work product relevant to
          the case. No attorney briefs! No amicus briefs! None from the court
          below! That�s not necessarily like real life, though. We�re back in
          academia, and the rules are different. We can probably do better than
          the real thing in some cases. You also can�t consult briefs online or
          hard copies. We can�t consult with each other until we�re told that we
          can. When in doubt, ask.</span

          >We will separate the ideal reader from the real reader. The judge
          doesn�t read the brief first, the clerk does, and sometimes that�s the
          <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">only</i> person who reads it.
          The judge will only use the brief if it�s helpful. Clerks may not be
          totally attentive readers. Judges might not be that attentive either.
          Regular folks will be reading the brief! You have to write it so that
          they�ll get it the first time!</span

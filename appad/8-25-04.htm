          conferences: macro Sept. 12 and 13. I missed when Micro is. Send her
          copies of all our documents in Word format. The deadlines are when we
          get the hard copy in her mailbox: </span

          of the deadline date. Get her the e-mail copy within a day or two of
          that. She�ll do extensions if they are requested at least 24 hours in
          advance (several days, not weeks). She prefers interim drafts after we
          conference. She doesn�t mind going over sections or paragraphs of a
          draft. We�ll do an hour after the micro draft, and an hour (at least)
          about oral argument.</span

          argument that covers all the possible arguments and parts of each
          argument that are possible. The outline is a very important part. The
          Commerce Clause is not the easiest clause to get through!</span

          for recreational use. Has that ever been brought up? It�s interesting
          when Congress uses the Commerce Clause to do things like this and then
          apply it in weird situations.</span
